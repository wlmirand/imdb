 <sinopse>
  Pianist David Helfgott, driven by his father and teachers, has a breakdown. Years later he returns to the piano, to popular if not critical acclaim.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Based on the true story of Australian pianist David Helfgott, this delightful movie charts the traumatic early years through adulthood. Telling the story in flashback we see David as a child prodigy and as he grows up while his patriarchal father abuses him and his siblings with the memory of his childhood in Europe and the loss of his family in the concentration camps. David finally breaks away from his father and goes away to study overseas, he later suffers a breakdown and returns to Australia and a life in an institution. Many years later he is released and through several twists of fate (in reality even more unlikely than film portrays) he starts playing a piano in a bar before finally returning to the concert hall.

    Rush plays the man, and does a brilliant job. Yesterday (August 2013) I saw David in person, playing the piano in a performance in Cairns. To see him in real life, and playing as brilliantly as he does, makes one realise how close the film is to his actual life. If you don't get the opportunity to see David in real life, second best is to watch this film. Of course, there is some editorial licence in the film, and it is nigh on impossible to get into a person's head and way of thinking, but the flavour is there in the film. This film has not only entertainment value, but is a pseudo documentary about the life of a still-brilliant performer. When I saw David play live, I wondered how he could remember all the music without using any sheet music, and it was obvious by his mannerisms that he is still mentally affected - nevertheless, I believe he is one of the world's best pianists.

    Shine is the real life story of David Helfgott, a gifted pianist suffering from some severe mental problems. Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment. He recovers to some extent when he meets a woman who initially treats him as a patient and eventually marries him. The cast is outstanding, starting with Rush and with great support by Lynn Redgrave and John Gielgud. The music is also excellent.

    For a long time I had no opportunity to see this Australian film of different reasons but I have done it and I'm very happy because "Shine" is accurate the same as I its imagined. That's very inspiring drama with brilliant performances Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-Stahl and remarkable Noah Taylor that liked me more of all and earned "Oscar" like and genius Geoffrey Rush, in my opinion. I disappointed that he didn't been even if nominated for his role. I'm musician and I have clearly understanding the sense of that movie. Music is the great energy that capable of to raise you and also break you and your life. And else that is film about human egoism that destructive for lives others and ourselves. This film definitely made me cleverer.

    This is one of top 5 films I ever see. Story is very strong and performances are for 20. First time I watch this movie I just keep sitting after for 10 minutes and wonder... THIS IS ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MOVIE. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant and this part is how you say made for him. There is a thin line between genius and laugh but Geoffrey is made it. The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. I do not prefer this kind of music - but after the movie I got myself humming Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3.Geoffrey Rush got an Oscar for this performance

    shine is one of the most precious movies for me, i loved it from the first sight, its screen making, acting, cast, plot, every thing is just perfect, and above all how the writer and the director handle to express such intrigued element as the sensitive characters as David Helpoffgot. the movies is very rich in the thematic perspective, at first we have David and his father relationship, a point that explain a great deal of each of both character and their psychology. David's father is a authoritative patriarchal sort of character, that can never let anything pass its borders unmarked, that's how he express all his emotion in this display of aggressive power, like his love to his son he says;"non one ever loves you more than me", to his family which he want to fix it in one dimension forever. on the other hands, we see David naturally as a fragile quite child, music is his talent and his sentimental outbreak, but some time i wander whether was his father shades on him that makes piano is the only personal expression for him. i believe that David's sensitivity and fragility is tidily linked with his musical talent; music is a powerful mean of human soul out release, it "express so completely the inexpressible" that the human heart is capable of. In contrast, we got David Helpoffgot who got this talent of musical performance,his overwhelm sensitivity is so delicate to a point that he can not merely contact to the out side world but by the music help. David fallowed his teacher's advice when he told him to "to play like there is no tomorrow", may be he did not realize that he was giving it just to the right person, because there was practically no tomorrow when David had unified with his music, and show us why pure human sentiments can not be reflected in the material world? because it's just the opposite of it. yet David dealt with it, and till now i'm most grateful for the writer to show us simply how this creature could live with such enormous power of sentiment. the uniqueness of shine that unlike all other biographical movies that it does not tells us about rising talent as usual, but about falling one. a thing more common in our unfair world than the successful ones. Finally i'm bound to comment of the last scene of the piano concert, who he manage to defeat his past, his fear and play again. his tears tell us with precious understatement that all that the real talent want on earth is the recognition of the other.

    Amazing movie. Go watch it if you haven't yet. Ugandian born (now Australian) Scott Hicks made this near masterpiece movie and actually left me willing to explore more of his works. Shine is about David Helfgott (Alex Rafalowicz, Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush). David sees since very young his life driven towards the fields of the piano. His father, visibly victimised by his austere father (Alex Rafalowicz), demands perfection from him and also extreme loyalty to him. His father sacrifices a lot of his potential in order to fulfil his desires and wills, including not allowing David to go study in the States. A few years later he receives a scholarship from the Royal College of Music in London, an opportunity which is father obviously declined. But David was already older enough and left home, what shocked his father, who decided to clear David from his family, believing his acts were a complete betrayal. Anyway, in London, David practises like an animal and reaches the complete success, winning a competition, when ha has a mental breakdown on stage. Years pass and he is forgotten, until his talent is rediscovered, by accident. Very powerful movie. Got me by surprise because I didn't knew, even during the movie that his mental illness, allied with his great talent, who be pu together so brilliantly. Geoffrey Rush received one of the most deserved Oscars the Academy has ever given. He had in my opinion what might just be his best performance of his whole career. Although works well to dramatize David's youth, it seems to me that his father is too much exaggerated, as his family say he was nothing like shown in the family. The same happens with David's quality in the piano after the breakdown, that is supposed to be a somehow worse that the movie implies. That clearly separates this movie from total perfection. Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10

    A Shining Success

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

    It is both moving, and a whimsically entertaining film to view, as Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor both demonstrate their unique performances as the well respected, but terribly ill pianist, David Helfgott. Marked with Schizoaffective disorder, an illness so damaging that it affected the very mood and form of speech of young David, up until his overall lost result, with nothing but the disease itself became the very thing left to master. Growing up in Melbourne Australia, David grew up under the care of his parents and the company of his sisters. His father Peter, stubbornly played by Armin Muellar-Stahl, taught and inspired his David to perfect his talent with the piano. He even sought for his son to learn the 3rd concerto by Rachmaninoff, yet never encouraging to leave and improve his talent beyond there little home. It was the very encouraging words of a compassionate Australian communist, Katharine Prichard, that young David (Taylor) would go to London, and study in the Royal College of Music. His desire to make his own decision caused his father to disown him, and thus further pushing him away. As young David continues to practice, the illness that soon claimed his way of life took hold, whether it was in his moments of practice, or his literal demonstration of the 3rd concerto, David lost himself in the moment. David (Rush), at a much older age, as been up and around with his life, moving from an institution to a hotel, and then to piano playing hobby in a restaurant. These are all many turns in his life, to the very point when he meets the love of his life Gillian. David's relationship with his father was a major turn in his life, as it simply ended in regretful, but a brief moment of reconcile. Peter hugged his son after years of rejection, and the burden of their tension was lifted, thus making his fathers departure from this world all the more sad, for David had to play for all those who loved him, but his father. "Shine" can't be characterized as one of the greatest bio flicks I've ever viewed, however, the performances liven up the screen with both their authentic portrayals, and the conflicts among the characters. The individual portrayals of Helfgott in his youth and mid life surprised me, with the performance of Noah Taylor, representing the tormented side of David, slowly being consumed by his dedication to music, as well that very depression the consumed him for most of his life. Geoffrey Rush portrays David at a mid age, speaking in disorganized, but arithmetic pattern of speech, changing from one subject to another, exemplifying the result of his disorder. The way Rushbrings his portrayal to life, is both enjoyable and amusing. Stahl forms a cloud of inner tension among David and his performance of Peter Helfgott, and that very tension has probably been one of the major contributions to David's illness. The film "Shine" may be a little disorganized with it's direction. The first half with a young David growing up and spiraling into a wing of depression well done, however, the remaining half of his mid life seemed rather brief for my tastes, despite the overall theme of his comeback being very inspirational. Geoffrey Rush and Stahl are very great actors that make "Shine" shine in glory.

    Scott Hicks tells a moving story of musician David Helfgott, a child prodigy who vanishes into oblivion because of a mental illness while he continues battling his inner demons. The storytelling is non-linear but it's easy to follow and the director manages to grab the viewer's attention. Hicks has used a minimal approach in execution. The sets and art direction are simplistic. The cinematography and score is subtle (except for the key instrumental pieces). The musical pieces have been used very effectively and they are featured in some of the most poignant scenes. I liked that the director doesn't manipulate the viewer's emotion too much (which is the kind of risk one would run when making a truth-based story) through melodrama or excessive glossiness. In addition, 'Shine' has some first rate performances lead wonderfully by an amazing Geoffrey Rush and a superb Noah Taylor. Rush has delivered one of the finest portrayals of a mentally ill character. They are excellently supported by Armin Muller-Stahl, Nicholas Bell and Lynn Redgrave. 'Shine' is a very human uplifiting movie. After the credits have rolled, one feels a sense of positiveness as they have just witnessed the triumph of a trapped and tortured soul.

    An incredibly captivating film that does the right thing in keeping its running time below two hours. The story of the talented pianist David Helfgott who looses his mind, much due to his father's harsh treatment, is partly based on a true story, and is arresting right from the opening scene. Geoffrey Rush won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, although he only appears for about 40 minutes of the film, and he, Alex Rafalowicz and Noah Taylor all makes for great performances as the leading man throughout his maturing life. We are naturally charmed and compelled by Helfgott and his incredible piano skills, and although the film could easily have been a downer, it's uplifting, full of wonderful humor and enjoyable.

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

    It is both moving, and a whimsically entertaining film to view, as Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor both demonstrate their unique performances as the well respected, but terribly ill pianist, David Helfgott. Marked with Schizoaffective disorder, an illness so damaging that it affected the very mood and form of speech of young David, up until his overall lost result, with nothing but the disease itself became the very thing left to master. Growing up in Melbourne Australia, David grew up under the care of his parents and the company of his sisters. His father Peter, stubbornly played by Armin Muellar-Stahl, taught and inspired his David to perfect his talent with the piano. He even sought for his son to learn the 3rd concerto by Rachmaninoff, yet never encouraging to leave and improve his talent beyond there little home. It was the very encouraging words of a compassionate Australian communist, Katharine Prichard, that young David (Taylor) would go to London, and study in the Royal College of Music. His desire to make his own decision caused his father to disown him, and thus further pushing him away. As young David continues to practice, the illness that soon claimed his way of life took hold, whether it was in his moments of practice, or his literal demonstration of the 3rd concerto, David lost himself in the moment. David (Rush), at a much older age, as been up and around with his life, moving from an institution to a hotel, and then to piano playing hobby in a restaurant. These are all many turns in his life, to the very point when he meets the love of his life Gillian. David's relationship with his father was a major turn in his life, as it simply ended in regretful, but a brief moment of reconcile. Peter hugged his son after years of rejection, and the burden of their tension was lifted, thus making his fathers departure from this world all the more sad, for David had to play for all those who loved him, but his father. "Shine" can't be characterized as one of the greatest bio flicks I've ever viewed, however, the performances liven up the screen with both their authentic portrayals, and the conflicts among the characters. The individual portrayals of Helfgott in his youth and mid life surprised me, with the performance of Noah Taylor, representing the tormented side of David, slowly being consumed by his dedication to music, as well that very depression the consumed him for most of his life. Geoffrey Rush portrays David at a mid age, speaking in disorganized, but arithmetic pattern of speech, changing from one subject to another, exemplifying the result of his disorder. The way Rushbrings his portrayal to life, is both enjoyable and amusing. Stahl forms a cloud of inner tension among David and his performance of Peter Helfgott, and that very tension has probably been one of the major contributions to David's illness. The film "Shine" may be a little disorganized with it's direction. The first half with a young David growing up and spiraling into a wing of depression well done, however, the remaining half of his mid life seemed rather brief for my tastes, despite the overall theme of his comeback being very inspirational. Geoffrey Rush and Stahl are very great actors that make "Shine" shine in glory.

    Scott Hicks tells a moving story of musician David Helfgott, a child prodigy who vanishes into oblivion because of a mental illness while he continues battling his inner demons. The storytelling is non-linear but it's easy to follow and the director manages to grab the viewer's attention. Hicks has used a minimal approach in execution. The sets and art direction are simplistic. The cinematography and score is subtle (except for the key instrumental pieces). The musical pieces have been used very effectively and they are featured in some of the most poignant scenes. I liked that the director doesn't manipulate the viewer's emotion too much (which is the kind of risk one would run when making a truth-based story) through melodrama or excessive glossiness. In addition, 'Shine' has some first rate performances lead wonderfully by an amazing Geoffrey Rush and a superb Noah Taylor. Rush has delivered one of the finest portrayals of a mentally ill character. They are excellently supported by Armin Muller-Stahl, Nicholas Bell and Lynn Redgrave. 'Shine' is a very human uplifiting movie. After the credits have rolled, one feels a sense of positiveness as they have just witnessed the triumph of a trapped and tortured soul.

    An incredibly captivating film that does the right thing in keeping its running time below two hours. The story of the talented pianist David Helfgott who looses his mind, much due to his father's harsh treatment, is partly based on a true story, and is arresting right from the opening scene. Geoffrey Rush won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, although he only appears for about 40 minutes of the film, and he, Alex Rafalowicz and Noah Taylor all makes for great performances as the leading man throughout his maturing life. We are naturally charmed and compelled by Helfgott and his incredible piano skills, and although the film could easily have been a downer, it's uplifting, full of wonderful humor and enjoyable.

    Rush plays the man, and does a brilliant job. Yesterday (August 2013) I saw David in person, playing the piano in a performance in Cairns. To see him in real life, and playing as brilliantly as he does, makes one realise how close the film is to his actual life. If you don't get the opportunity to see David in real life, second best is to watch this film. Of course, there is some editorial licence in the film, and it is nigh on impossible to get into a person's head and way of thinking, but the flavour is there in the film. This film has not only entertainment value, but is a pseudo documentary about the life of a still-brilliant performer. When I saw David play live, I wondered how he could remember all the music without using any sheet music, and it was obvious by his mannerisms that he is still mentally affected - nevertheless, I believe he is one of the world's best pianists.

    Shine is the real life story of David Helfgott, a gifted pianist suffering from some severe mental problems. Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment. He recovers to some extent when he meets a woman who initially treats him as a patient and eventually marries him. The cast is outstanding, starting with Rush and with great support by Lynn Redgrave and John Gielgud. The music is also excellent.

    For a long time I had no opportunity to see this Australian film of different reasons but I have done it and I'm very happy because "Shine" is accurate the same as I its imagined. That's very inspiring drama with brilliant performances Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-Stahl and remarkable Noah Taylor that liked me more of all and earned "Oscar" like and genius Geoffrey Rush, in my opinion. I disappointed that he didn't been even if nominated for his role. I'm musician and I have clearly understanding the sense of that movie. Music is the great energy that capable of to raise you and also break you and your life. And else that is film about human egoism that destructive for lives others and ourselves. This film definitely made me cleverer.

    This is one of top 5 films I ever see. Story is very strong and performances are for 20. First time I watch this movie I just keep sitting after for 10 minutes and wonder... THIS IS ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MOVIE. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant and this part is how you say made for him. There is a thin line between genius and laugh but Geoffrey is made it. The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. I do not prefer this kind of music - but after the movie I got myself humming Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3.Geoffrey Rush got an Oscar for this performance

    shine is one of the most precious movies for me, i loved it from the first sight, its screen making, acting, cast, plot, every thing is just perfect, and above all how the writer and the director handle to express such intrigued element as the sensitive characters as David Helpoffgot. the movies is very rich in the thematic perspective, at first we have David and his father relationship, a point that explain a great deal of each of both character and their psychology. David's father is a authoritative patriarchal sort of character, that can never let anything pass its borders unmarked, that's how he express all his emotion in this display of aggressive power, like his love to his son he says;"non one ever loves you more than me", to his family which he want to fix it in one dimension forever. on the other hands, we see David naturally as a fragile quite child, music is his talent and his sentimental outbreak, but some time i wander whether was his father shades on him that makes piano is the only personal expression for him. i believe that David's sensitivity and fragility is tidily linked with his musical talent; music is a powerful mean of human soul out release, it "express so completely the inexpressible" that the human heart is capable of. In contrast, we got David Helpoffgot who got this talent of musical performance,his overwhelm sensitivity is so delicate to a point that he can not merely contact to the out side world but by the music help. David fallowed his teacher's advice when he told him to "to play like there is no tomorrow", may be he did not realize that he was giving it just to the right person, because there was practically no tomorrow when David had unified with his music, and show us why pure human sentiments can not be reflected in the material world? because it's just the opposite of it. yet David dealt with it, and till now i'm most grateful for the writer to show us simply how this creature could live with such enormous power of sentiment. the uniqueness of shine that unlike all other biographical movies that it does not tells us about rising talent as usual, but about falling one. a thing more common in our unfair world than the successful ones. Finally i'm bound to comment of the last scene of the piano concert, who he manage to defeat his past, his fear and play again. his tears tell us with precious understatement that all that the real talent want on earth is the recognition of the other.

    Amazing movie. Go watch it if you haven't yet. Ugandian born (now Australian) Scott Hicks made this near masterpiece movie and actually left me willing to explore more of his works. Shine is about David Helfgott (Alex Rafalowicz, Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush). David sees since very young his life driven towards the fields of the piano. His father, visibly victimised by his austere father (Alex Rafalowicz), demands perfection from him and also extreme loyalty to him. His father sacrifices a lot of his potential in order to fulfil his desires and wills, including not allowing David to go study in the States. A few years later he receives a scholarship from the Royal College of Music in London, an opportunity which is father obviously declined. But David was already older enough and left home, what shocked his father, who decided to clear David from his family, believing his acts were a complete betrayal. Anyway, in London, David practises like an animal and reaches the complete success, winning a competition, when ha has a mental breakdown on stage. Years pass and he is forgotten, until his talent is rediscovered, by accident. Very powerful movie. Got me by surprise because I didn't knew, even during the movie that his mental illness, allied with his great talent, who be pu together so brilliantly. Geoffrey Rush received one of the most deserved Oscars the Academy has ever given. He had in my opinion what might just be his best performance of his whole career. Although works well to dramatize David's youth, it seems to me that his father is too much exaggerated, as his family say he was nothing like shown in the family. The same happens with David's quality in the piano after the breakdown, that is supposed to be a somehow worse that the movie implies. That clearly separates this movie from total perfection. Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

Music is the great energy that capable of to raise you and also break you and your life. And else that is film about human egoism that destructive for lives others and ourselves. This film definitely made me cleverer.

    This is one of top 5 films I ever see. Story is very strong and performances are for 20. First time I watch this movie I just keep sitting after for 10 minutes and wonder... THIS IS ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MOVIE. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant and this part is how you say made for him. There is a thin line between genius and laugh but Geoffrey is made it. The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. I do not prefer this kind of music - but after the movie I got myself humming Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3.Geoffrey Rush got an Oscar for this performance

    shine is one of the most precious movies for me, i loved it from the first sight, its screen making, acting, cast, plot, every thing is just perfect, and above all how the writer and the director handle to express such intrigued element as the sensitive characters as David Helpoffgot. the movies is very rich in the thematic perspective, at first we have David and his father relationship, a point that explain a great deal of each of both character and their psychology. David's father is a authoritative patriarchal sort of character, that can never let anything pass its borders unmarked, that's how he express all his emotion in this display of aggressive power, like his love to his son he says;"non one ever loves you more than me", to his family which he want to fix it in one dimension forever. on the other hands, we see David naturally as a fragile quite child, music is his talent and his sentimental outbreak, but some time i wander whether was his father shades on him that makes piano is the only personal expression for him. i believe that David's sensitivity and fragility is tidily linked with his musical talent; music is a powerful mean of human soul out release, it "express so completely the inexpressible" that the human heart is capable of. In contrast, we got David Helpoffgot who got this talent of musical performance,his overwhelm sensitivity is so delicate to a point that he can not merely contact to the out side world but by the music help. David fallowed his teacher's advice when he told him to "to play like there is no tomorrow", may be he did not realize that he was giving it just to the right person, because there was practically no tomorrow when David had unified with his music, and show us why pure human sentiments can not be reflected in the material world? because it's just the opposite of it. yet David dealt with it, and till now i'm most grateful for the writer to show us simply how this creature could live with such enormous power of sentiment. the uniqueness of shine that unlike all other biographical movies that it does not tells us about rising talent as usual, but about falling one. a thing more common in our unfair world than the successful ones. Finally i'm bound to comment of the last scene of the piano concert, who he manage to defeat his past, his fear and play again. his tears tell us with precious understatement that all that the real talent want on earth is the recognition of the other.

    Amazing movie. Go watch it if you haven't yet. Ugandian born (now Australian) Scott Hicks made this near masterpiece movie and actually left me willing to explore more of his works. Shine is about David Helfgott (Alex Rafalowicz, Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush). David sees since very young his life driven towards the fields of the piano. His father, visibly victimised by his austere father (Alex Rafalowicz), demands perfection from him and also extreme loyalty to him. His father sacrifices a lot of his potential in order to fulfil his desires and wills, including not allowing David to go study in the States. A few years later he receives a scholarship from the Royal College of Music in London, an opportunity which is father obviously declined. But David was already older enough and left home, what shocked his father, who decided to clear David from his family, believing his acts were a complete betrayal. Anyway, in London, David practises like an animal and reaches the complete success, winning a competition, when ha has a mental breakdown on stage. Years pass and he is forgotten, until his talent is rediscovered, by accident. Very powerful movie. Got me by surprise because I didn't knew, even during the movie that his mental illness, allied with his great talent, who be pu together so brilliantly. Geoffrey Rush received one of the most deserved Oscars the Academy has ever given. He had in my opinion what might just be his best performance of his whole career. Although works well to dramatize David's youth, it seems to me that his father is too much exaggerated, as his family say he was nothing like shown in the family. The same happens with David's quality in the piano after the breakdown, that is supposed to be a somehow worse that the movie implies. That clearly separates this movie from total perfection. Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10

    A Shining Success

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

    It is both moving, and a whimsically entertaining film to view, as Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor both demonstrate their unique performances as the well respected, but terribly ill pianist, David Helfgott. Marked with Schizoaffective disorder, an illness so damaging that it affected the very mood and form of speech of young David, up until his overall lost result, with nothing but the disease itself became the very thing left to master. Growing up in Melbourne Australia, David grew up under the care of his parents and the company of his sisters. His father Peter, stubbornly played by Armin Muellar-Stahl, taught and inspired his David to perfect his talent with the piano. He even sought for his son to learn the 3rd concerto by Rachmaninoff, yet never encouraging to leave and improve his talent beyond there little home. It was the very encouraging words of a compassionate Australian communist, Katharine Prichard, that young David (Taylor) would go to London, and study in the Royal College of Music. His desire to make his own decision caused his father to disown him, and thus further pushing him away. As young David continues to practice, the illness that soon claimed his way of life took hold, whether it was in his moments of practice, or his literal demonstration of the 3rd concerto, David lost himself in the moment. David (Rush), at a much older age, as been up and around with his life, moving from an institution to a hotel, and then to piano playing hobby in a restaurant. These are all many turns in his life, to the very point when he meets the love of his life Gillian. David's relationship with his father was a major turn in his life, as it simply ended in regretful, but a brief moment of reconcile. Peter hugged his son after years of rejection, and the burden of their tension was lifted, thus making his fathers departure from this world all the more sad, for David had to play for all those who loved him, but his father. "Shine" can't be characterized as one of the greatest bio flicks I've ever viewed, however, the performances liven up the screen with both their authentic portrayals, and the conflicts among the characters. The individual portrayals of Helfgott in his youth and mid life surprised me, with the performance of Noah Taylor, representing the tormented side of David, slowly being consumed by his dedication to music, as well that very depression the consumed him for most of his life. Geoffrey Rush portrays David at a mid age, speaking in disorganized, but arithmetic pattern of speech, changing from one subject to another, exemplifying the result of his disorder. The way Rushbrings his portrayal to life, is both enjoyable and amusing. Stahl forms a cloud of inner tension among David and his performance of Peter Helfgott, and that very tension has probably been one of the major contributions to David's illness. The film "Shine" may be a little disorganized with it's direction. The first half with a young David growing up and spiraling into a wing of depression well done, however, the remaining half of his mid life seemed rather brief for my tastes, despite the overall theme of his comeback being very inspirational. Geoffrey Rush and Stahl are very great actors that make "Shine" shine in glory.

    Scott Hicks tells a moving story of musician David Helfgott, a child prodigy who vanishes into oblivion because of a mental illness while he continues battling his inner demons. The storytelling is non-linear but it's easy to follow and the director manages to grab the viewer's attention. Hicks has used a minimal approach in execution. The sets and art direction are simplistic. The cinematography and score is subtle (except for the key instrumental pieces). The musical pieces have been used very effectively and they are featured in some of the most poignant scenes. I liked that the director doesn't manipulate the viewer's emotion too much (which is the kind of risk one would run when making a truth-based story) through melodrama or excessive glossiness. In addition, 'Shine' has some first rate performances lead wonderfully by an amazing Geoffrey Rush and a superb Noah Taylor. Rush has delivered one of the finest portrayals of a mentally ill character. They are excellently supported by Armin Muller-Stahl, Nicholas Bell and Lynn Redgrave. 'Shine' is a very human uplifiting movie. After the credits have rolled, one feels a sense of positiveness as they have just witnessed the triumph of a trapped and tortured soul.

    An incredibly captivating film that does the right thing in keeping its running time below two hours. The story of the talented pianist David Helfgott who looses his mind, much due to his father's harsh treatment, is partly based on a true story, and is arresting right from the opening scene. Geoffrey Rush won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, although he only appears for about 40 minutes of the film, and he, Alex Rafalowicz and Noah Taylor all makes for great performances as the leading man throughout his maturing life. We are naturally charmed and compelled by Helfgott and his incredible piano skills, and although the film could easily have been a downer, it's uplifting, full of wonderful humor and enjoyable.

    Rush plays the man, and does a brilliant job. Yesterday (August 2013) I saw David in person, playing the piano in a performance in Cairns. To see him in real life, and playing as brilliantly as he does, makes one realise how close the film is to his actual life. If you don't get the opportunity to see David in real life, second best is to watch this film. Of course, there is some editorial licence in the film, and it is nigh on impossible to get into a person's head and way of thinking, but the flavour is there in the film. This film has not only entertainment value, but is a pseudo documentary about the life of a still-brilliant performer. When I saw David play live, I wondered how he could remember all the music without using any sheet music, and it was obvious by his mannerisms that he is still mentally affected - nevertheless, I believe he is one of the world's best pianists.

    Shine is the real life story of David Helfgott, a gifted pianist suffering from some severe mental problems. Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment. He recovers to some extent when he meets a woman who initially treats him as a patient and eventually marries him. The cast is outstanding, starting with Rush and with great support by Lynn Redgrave and John Gielgud. The music is also excellent.

    For a long time I had no opportunity to see this Australian film of different reasons but I have done it and I'm very happy because "Shine" is accurate the same as I its imagined. That's very inspiring drama with brilliant performances Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-Stahl and remarkable Noah Taylor that liked me more of all and earned "Oscar" like and genius Geoffrey Rush, in my opinion. I disappointed that he didn't been even if nominated for his role. I'm musician and I have clearly understanding the sense of that movie. Music is the great energy that capable of to raise you and also break you and your life. And else that is film about human egoism that destructive for lives others and ourselves. This film definitely made me cleverer.

THIS IS ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MOVIE. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant and this part is how you say made for him. There is a thin line between genius and laugh but Geoffrey is made it. The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. I do not prefer this kind of music - but after the movie I got myself humming Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3.Geoffrey Rush got an Oscar for this performance

Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

    It is both moving, and a whimsically entertaining film to view, as Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor both demonstrate their unique performances as the well respected, but terribly ill pianist, David Helfgott. Marked with Schizoaffective disorder, an illness so damaging that it affected the very mood and form of speech of young David, up until his overall lost result, with nothing but the disease itself became the very thing left to master. Growing up in Melbourne Australia, David grew up under the care of his parents and the company of his sisters. His father Peter, stubbornly played by Armin Muellar-Stahl, taught and inspired his David to perfect his talent with the piano. He even sought for his son to learn the 3rd concerto by Rachmaninoff, yet never encouraging to leave and improve his talent beyond there little home. It was the very encouraging words of a compassionate Australian communist, Katharine Prichard, that young David (Taylor) would go to London, and study in the Royal College of Music. His desire to make his own decision caused his father to disown him, and thus further pushing him away. As young David continues to practice, the illness that soon claimed his way of life took hold, whether it was in his moments of practice, or his literal demonstration of the 3rd concerto, David lost himself in the moment. David (Rush), at a much older age, as been up and around with his life, moving from an institution to a hotel, and then to piano playing hobby in a restaurant. These are all many turns in his life, to the very point when he meets the love of his life Gillian. David's relationship with his father was a major turn in his life, as it simply ended in regretful, but a brief moment of reconcile. Peter hugged his son after years of rejection, and the burden of their tension was lifted, thus making his fathers departure from this world all the more sad, for David had to play for all those who loved him, but his father. "Shine" can't be characterized as one of the greatest bio flicks I've ever viewed, however, the performances liven up the screen with both their authentic portrayals, and the conflicts among the characters. The individual portrayals of Helfgott in his youth and mid life surprised me, with the performance of Noah Taylor, representing the tormented side of David, slowly being consumed by his dedication to music, as well that very depression the consumed him for most of his life. Geoffrey Rush portrays David at a mid age, speaking in disorganized, but arithmetic pattern of speech, changing from one subject to another, exemplifying the result of his disorder. The way Rushbrings his portrayal to life, is both enjoyable and amusing. Stahl forms a cloud of inner tension among David and his performance of Peter Helfgott, and that very tension has probably been one of the major contributions to David's illness. The film "Shine" may be a little disorganized with it's direction. The first half with a young David growing up and spiraling into a wing of depression well done, however, the remaining half of his mid life seemed rather brief for my tastes, despite the overall theme of his comeback being very inspirational. Geoffrey Rush and Stahl are very great actors that make "Shine" shine in glory.

    Scott Hicks tells a moving story of musician David Helfgott, a child prodigy who vanishes into oblivion because of a mental illness while he continues battling his inner demons. The storytelling is non-linear but it's easy to follow and the director manages to grab the viewer's attention. Hicks has used a minimal approach in execution. The sets and art direction are simplistic. The cinematography and score is subtle (except for the key instrumental pieces). The musical pieces have been used very effectively and they are featured in some of the most poignant scenes. I liked that the director doesn't manipulate the viewer's emotion too much (which is the kind of risk one would run when making a truth-based story) through melodrama or excessive glossiness. In addition, 'Shine' has some first rate performances lead wonderfully by an amazing Geoffrey Rush and a superb Noah Taylor. Rush has delivered one of the finest portrayals of a mentally ill character. They are excellently supported by Armin Muller-Stahl, Nicholas Bell and Lynn Redgrave. 'Shine' is a very human uplifiting movie. After the credits have rolled, one feels a sense of positiveness as they have just witnessed the triumph of a trapped and tortured soul.

    An incredibly captivating film that does the right thing in keeping its running time below two hours. The story of the talented pianist David Helfgott who looses his mind, much due to his father's harsh treatment, is partly based on a true story, and is arresting right from the opening scene. Geoffrey Rush won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, although he only appears for about 40 minutes of the film, and he, Alex Rafalowicz and Noah Taylor all makes for great performances as the leading man throughout his maturing life. We are naturally charmed and compelled by Helfgott and his incredible piano skills, and although the film could easily have been a downer, it's uplifting, full of wonderful humor and enjoyable.

    Rush plays the man, and does a brilliant job. Yesterday (August 2013) I saw David in person, playing the piano in a performance in Cairns. To see him in real life, and playing as brilliantly as he does, makes one realise how close the film is to his actual life. If you don't get the opportunity to see David in real life, second best is to watch this film. Of course, there is some editorial licence in the film, and it is nigh on impossible to get into a person's head and way of thinking, but the flavour is there in the film. This film has not only entertainment value, but is a pseudo documentary about the life of a still-brilliant performer. When I saw David play live, I wondered how he could remember all the music without using any sheet music, and it was obvious by his mannerisms that he is still mentally affected - nevertheless, I believe he is one of the world's best pianists.

    Shine is the real life story of David Helfgott, a gifted pianist suffering from some severe mental problems. Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment. He recovers to some extent when he meets a woman who initially treats him as a patient and eventually marries him. The cast is outstanding, starting with Rush and with great support by Lynn Redgrave and John Gielgud. The music is also excellent.

    For a long time I had no opportunity to see this Australian film of different reasons but I have done it and I'm very happy because "Shine" is accurate the same as I its imagined. That's very inspiring drama with brilliant performances Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-Stahl and remarkable Noah Taylor that liked me more of all and earned "Oscar" like and genius Geoffrey Rush, in my opinion. I disappointed that he didn't been even if nominated for his role. I'm musician and I have clearly understanding the sense of that movie. Music is the great energy that capable of to raise you and also break you and your life. And else that is film about human egoism that destructive for lives others and ourselves. This film definitely made me cleverer.

    This is one of top 5 films I ever see. Story is very strong and performances are for 20. First time I watch this movie I just keep sitting after for 10 minutes and wonder... THIS IS ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MOVIE. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant and this part is how you say made for him. There is a thin line between genius and laugh but Geoffrey is made it. The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. I do not prefer this kind of music - but after the movie I got myself humming Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3.Geoffrey Rush got an Oscar for this performance

    shine is one of the most precious movies for me, i loved it from the first sight, its screen making, acting, cast, plot, every thing is just perfect, and above all how the writer and the director handle to express such intrigued element as the sensitive characters as David Helpoffgot. the movies is very rich in the thematic perspective, at first we have David and his father relationship, a point that explain a great deal of each of both character and their psychology. David's father is a authoritative patriarchal sort of character, that can never let anything pass its borders unmarked, that's how he express all his emotion in this display of aggressive power, like his love to his son he says;"non one ever loves you more than me", to his family which he want to fix it in one dimension forever. on the other hands, we see David naturally as a fragile quite child, music is his talent and his sentimental outbreak, but some time i wander whether was his father shades on him that makes piano is the only personal expression for him. i believe that David's sensitivity and fragility is tidily linked with his musical talent; music is a powerful mean of human soul out release, it "express so completely the inexpressible" that the human heart is capable of. In contrast, we got David Helpoffgot who got this talent of musical performance,his overwhelm sensitivity is so delicate to a point that he can not merely contact to the out side world but by the music help. David fallowed his teacher's advice when he told him to "to play like there is no tomorrow", may be he did not realize that he was giving it just to the right person, because there was practically no tomorrow when David had unified with his music, and show us why pure human sentiments can not be reflected in the material world? because it's just the opposite of it. yet David dealt with it, and till now i'm most grateful for the writer to show us simply how this creature could live with such enormous power of sentiment. the uniqueness of shine that unlike all other biographical movies that it does not tells us about rising talent as usual, but about falling one. a thing more common in our unfair world than the successful ones. Finally i'm bound to comment of the last scene of the piano concert, who he manage to defeat his past, his fear and play again. his tears tell us with precious understatement that all that the real talent want on earth is the recognition of the other.

    Amazing movie. Go watch it if you haven't yet. Ugandian born (now Australian) Scott Hicks made this near masterpiece movie and actually left me willing to explore more of his works. Shine is about David Helfgott (Alex Rafalowicz, Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush). David sees since very young his life driven towards the fields of the piano. His father, visibly victimised by his austere father (Alex Rafalowicz), demands perfection from him and also extreme loyalty to him. His father sacrifices a lot of his potential in order to fulfil his desires and wills, including not allowing David to go study in the States. A few years later he receives a scholarship from the Royal College of Music in London, an opportunity which is father obviously declined. But David was already older enough and left home, what shocked his father, who decided to clear David from his family, believing his acts were a complete betrayal. Anyway, in London, David practises like an animal and reaches the complete success, winning a competition, when ha has a mental breakdown on stage. Years pass and he is forgotten, until his talent is rediscovered, by accident. Very powerful movie. Got me by surprise because I didn't knew, even during the movie that his mental illness, allied with his great talent, who be pu together so brilliantly. Geoffrey Rush received one of the most deserved Oscars the Academy has ever given. He had in my opinion what might just be his best performance of his whole career. Although works well to dramatize David's youth, it seems to me that his father is too much exaggerated, as his family say he was nothing like shown in the family. The same happens with David's quality in the piano after the breakdown, that is supposed to be a somehow worse that the movie implies. That clearly separates this movie from total perfection. Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10

    A Shining Success

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

    It is both moving, and a whimsically entertaining film to view, as Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor both demonstrate their unique performances as the well respected, but terribly ill pianist, David Helfgott. Marked with Schizoaffective disorder, an illness so damaging that it affected the very mood and form of speech of young David, up until his overall lost result, with nothing but the disease itself became the very thing left to master. Growing up in Melbourne Australia, David grew up under the care of his parents and the company of his sisters. His father Peter, stubbornly played by Armin Muellar-Stahl, taught and inspired his David to perfect his talent with the piano. He even sought for his son to learn the 3rd concerto by Rachmaninoff, yet never encouraging to leave and improve his talent beyond there little home. It was the very encouraging words of a compassionate Australian communist, Katharine Prichard, that young David (Taylor) would go to London, and study in the Royal College of Music. His desire to make his own decision caused his father to disown him, and thus further pushing him away. As young David continues to practice, the illness that soon claimed his way of life took hold, whether it was in his moments of practice, or his literal demonstration of the 3rd concerto, David lost himself in the moment. David (Rush), at a much older age, as been up and around with his life, moving from an institution to a hotel, and then to piano playing hobby in a restaurant. These are all many turns in his life, to the very point when he meets the love of his life Gillian. David's relationship with his father was a major turn in his life, as it simply ended in regretful, but a brief moment of reconcile. Peter hugged his son after years of rejection, and the burden of their tension was lifted, thus making his fathers departure from this world all the more sad, for David had to play for all those who loved him, but his father. "Shine" can't be characterized as one of the greatest bio flicks I've ever viewed, however, the performances liven up the screen with both their authentic portrayals, and the conflicts among the characters. The individual portrayals of Helfgott in his youth and mid life surprised me, with the performance of Noah Taylor, representing the tormented side of David, slowly being consumed by his dedication to music, as well that very depression the consumed him for most of his life. Geoffrey Rush portrays David at a mid age, speaking in disorganized, but arithmetic pattern of speech, changing from one subject to another, exemplifying the result of his disorder. The way Rushbrings his portrayal to life, is both enjoyable and amusing. Stahl forms a cloud of inner tension among David and his performance of Peter Helfgott, and that very tension has probably been one of the major contributions to David's illness. The film "Shine" may be a little disorganized with it's direction. The first half with a young David growing up and spiraling into a wing of depression well done, however, the remaining half of his mid life seemed rather brief for my tastes, despite the overall theme of his comeback being very inspirational. Geoffrey Rush and Stahl are very great actors that make "Shine" shine in glory.

But David was already older enough and left home, what shocked his father, who decided to clear David from his family, believing his acts were a complete betrayal. Anyway, in London, David practises like an animal and reaches the complete success, winning a competition, when ha has a mental breakdown on stage. Years pass and he is forgotten, until his talent is rediscovered, by accident. Very powerful movie. Got me by surprise because I didn't knew, even during the movie that his mental illness, allied with his great talent, who be pu together so brilliantly. Geoffrey Rush received one of the most deserved Oscars the Academy has ever given. He had in my opinion what might just be his best performance of his whole career. Although works well to dramatize David's youth, it seems to me that his father is too much exaggerated, as his family say he was nothing like shown in the family. The same happens with David's quality in the piano after the breakdown, that is supposed to be a somehow worse that the movie implies. That clearly separates this movie from total perfection. Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10

    A Shining Success

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

    It is both moving, and a whimsically entertaining film to view, as Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor both demonstrate their unique performances as the well respected, but terribly ill pianist, David Helfgott. Marked with Schizoaffective disorder, an illness so damaging that it affected the very mood and form of speech of young David, up until his overall lost result, with nothing but the disease itself became the very thing left to master. Growing up in Melbourne Australia, David grew up under the care of his parents and the company of his sisters. His father Peter, stubbornly played by Armin Muellar-Stahl, taught and inspired his David to perfect his talent with the piano. He even sought for his son to learn the 3rd concerto by Rachmaninoff, yet never encouraging to leave and improve his talent beyond there little home. It was the very encouraging words of a compassionate Australian communist, Katharine Prichard, that young David (Taylor) would go to London, and study in the Royal College of Music. His desire to make his own decision caused his father to disown him, and thus further pushing him away. As young David continues to practice, the illness that soon claimed his way of life took hold, whether it was in his moments of practice, or his literal demonstration of the 3rd concerto, David lost himself in the moment. David (Rush), at a much older age, as been up and around with his life, moving from an institution to a hotel, and then to piano playing hobby in a restaurant. These are all many turns in his life, to the very point when he meets the love of his life Gillian. David's relationship with his father was a major turn in his life, as it simply ended in regretful, but a brief moment of reconcile. Peter hugged his son after years of rejection, and the burden of their tension was lifted, thus making his fathers departure from this world all the more sad, for David had to play for all those who loved him, but his father. "Shine" can't be characterized as one of the greatest bio flicks I've ever viewed, however, the performances liven up the screen with both their authentic portrayals, and the conflicts among the characters. The individual portrayals of Helfgott in his youth and mid life surprised me, with the performance of Noah Taylor, representing the tormented side of David, slowly being consumed by his dedication to music, as well that very depression the consumed him for most of his life. Geoffrey Rush portrays David at a mid age, speaking in disorganized, but arithmetic pattern of speech, changing from one subject to another, exemplifying the result of his disorder. The way Rushbrings his portrayal to life, is both enjoyable and amusing. Stahl forms a cloud of inner tension among David and his performance of Peter Helfgott, and that very tension has probably been one of the major contributions to David's illness. The film "Shine" may be a little disorganized with it's direction. The first half with a young David growing up and spiraling into a wing of depression well done, however, the remaining half of his mid life seemed rather brief for my tastes, despite the overall theme of his comeback being very inspirational. Geoffrey Rush and Stahl are very great actors that make "Shine" shine in glory.

    Scott Hicks tells a moving story of musician David Helfgott, a child prodigy who vanishes into oblivion because of a mental illness while he continues battling his inner demons. The storytelling is non-linear but it's easy to follow and the director manages to grab the viewer's attention. Hicks has used a minimal approach in execution. The sets and art direction are simplistic. The cinematography and score is subtle (except for the key instrumental pieces). The musical pieces have been used very effectively and they are featured in some of the most poignant scenes. I liked that the director doesn't manipulate the viewer's emotion too much (which is the kind of risk one would run when making a truth-based story) through melodrama or excessive glossiness. In addition, 'Shine' has some first rate performances lead wonderfully by an amazing Geoffrey Rush and a superb Noah Taylor. Rush has delivered one of the finest portrayals of a mentally ill character. They are excellently supported by Armin Muller-Stahl, Nicholas Bell and Lynn Redgrave. 'Shine' is a very human uplifiting movie. After the credits have rolled, one feels a sense of positiveness as they have just witnessed the triumph of a trapped and tortured soul.

    An incredibly captivating film that does the right thing in keeping its running time below two hours. The story of the talented pianist David Helfgott who looses his mind, much due to his father's harsh treatment, is partly based on a true story, and is arresting right from the opening scene. Geoffrey Rush won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, although he only appears for about 40 minutes of the film, and he, Alex Rafalowicz and Noah Taylor all makes for great performances as the leading man throughout his maturing life. We are naturally charmed and compelled by Helfgott and his incredible piano skills, and although the film could easily have been a downer, it's uplifting, full of wonderful humor and enjoyable.

    Rush plays the man, and does a brilliant job. Yesterday (August 2013) I saw David in person, playing the piano in a performance in Cairns. To see him in real life, and playing as brilliantly as he does, makes one realise how close the film is to his actual life. If you don't get the opportunity to see David in real life, second best is to watch this film. Of course, there is some editorial licence in the film, and it is nigh on impossible to get into a person's head and way of thinking, but the flavour is there in the film. This film has not only entertainment value, but is a pseudo documentary about the life of a still-brilliant performer. When I saw David play live, I wondered how he could remember all the music without using any sheet music, and it was obvious by his mannerisms that he is still mentally affected - nevertheless, I believe he is one of the world's best pianists.

    Shine is the real life story of David Helfgott, a gifted pianist suffering from some severe mental problems. Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment. He recovers to some extent when he meets a woman who initially treats him as a patient and eventually marries him. The cast is outstanding, starting with Rush and with great support by Lynn Redgrave and John Gielgud. The music is also excellent.

    For a long time I had no opportunity to see this Australian film of different reasons but I have done it and I'm very happy because "Shine" is accurate the same as I its imagined. That's very inspiring drama with brilliant performances Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-Stahl and remarkable Noah Taylor that liked me more of all and earned "Oscar" like and genius Geoffrey Rush, in my opinion. I disappointed that he didn't been even if nominated for his role. I'm musician and I have clearly understanding the sense of that movie. Music is the great energy that capable of to raise you and also break you and your life. And else that is film about human egoism that destructive for lives others and ourselves. This film definitely made me cleverer.

    This is one of top 5 films I ever see. Story is very strong and performances are for 20. First time I watch this movie I just keep sitting after for 10 minutes and wonder... THIS IS ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MOVIE. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant and this part is how you say made for him. There is a thin line between genius and laugh but Geoffrey is made it. The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. I do not prefer this kind of music - but after the movie I got myself humming Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3.Geoffrey Rush got an Oscar for this performance

    shine is one of the most precious movies for me, i loved it from the first sight, its screen making, acting, cast, plot, every thing is just perfect, and above all how the writer and the director handle to express such intrigued element as the sensitive characters as David Helpoffgot. the movies is very rich in the thematic perspective, at first we have David and his father relationship, a point that explain a great deal of each of both character and their psychology. David's father is a authoritative patriarchal sort of character, that can never let anything pass its borders unmarked, that's how he express all his emotion in this display of aggressive power, like his love to his son he says;"non one ever loves you more than me", to his family which he want to fix it in one dimension forever. on the other hands, we see David naturally as a fragile quite child, music is his talent and his sentimental outbreak, but some time i wander whether was his father shades on him that makes piano is the only personal expression for him. i believe that David's sensitivity and fragility is tidily linked with his musical talent; music is a powerful mean of human soul out release, it "express so completely the inexpressible" that the human heart is capable of. In contrast, we got David Helpoffgot who got this talent of musical performance,his overwhelm sensitivity is so delicate to a point that he can not merely contact to the out side world but by the music help. David fallowed his teacher's advice when he told him to "to play like there is no tomorrow", may be he did not realize that he was giving it just to the right person, because there was practically no tomorrow when David had unified with his music, and show us why pure human sentiments can not be reflected in the material world? because it's just the opposite of it. yet David dealt with it, and till now i'm most grateful for the writer to show us simply how this creature could live with such enormous power of sentiment. the uniqueness of shine that unlike all other biographical movies that it does not tells us about rising talent as usual, but about falling one. a thing more common in our unfair world than the successful ones. Finally i'm bound to comment of the last scene of the piano concert, who he manage to defeat his past, his fear and play again. his tears tell us with precious understatement that all that the real talent want on earth is the recognition of the other.

    Amazing movie. Go watch it if you haven't yet. Ugandian born (now Australian) Scott Hicks made this near masterpiece movie and actually left me willing to explore more of his works. Shine is about David Helfgott (Alex Rafalowicz, Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush). David sees since very young his life driven towards the fields of the piano. His father, visibly victimised by his austere father (Alex Rafalowicz), demands perfection from him and also extreme loyalty to him. His father sacrifices a lot of his potential in order to fulfil his desires and wills, including not allowing David to go study in the States. A few years later he receives a scholarship from the Royal College of Music in London, an opportunity which is father obviously declined. But David was already older enough and left home, what shocked his father, who decided to clear David from his family, believing his acts were a complete betrayal. Anyway, in London, David practises like an animal and reaches the complete success, winning a competition, when ha has a mental breakdown on stage. Years pass and he is forgotten, until his talent is rediscovered, by accident. Very powerful movie. Got me by surprise because I didn't knew, even during the movie that his mental illness, allied with his great talent, who be pu together so brilliantly. Geoffrey Rush received one of the most deserved Oscars the Academy has ever given. He had in my opinion what might just be his best performance of his whole career. Although works well to dramatize David's youth, it seems to me that his father is too much exaggerated, as his family say he was nothing like shown in the family. The same happens with David's quality in the piano after the breakdown, that is supposed to be a somehow worse that the movie implies. That clearly separates this movie from total perfection. Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment. He recovers to some extent when he meets a woman who initially treats him as a patient and eventually marries him. The cast is outstanding, starting with Rush and with great support by Lynn Redgrave and John Gielgud. The music is also excellent.

    For a long time I had no opportunity to see this Australian film of different reasons but I have done it and I'm very happy because "Shine" is accurate the same as I its imagined. That's very inspiring drama with brilliant performances Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-Stahl and remarkable Noah Taylor that liked me more of all and earned "Oscar" like and genius Geoffrey Rush, in my opinion. I disappointed that he didn't been even if nominated for his role. I'm musician and I have clearly understanding the sense of that movie. Music is the great energy that capable of to raise you and also break you and your life. And else that is film about human egoism that destructive for lives others and ourselves. This film definitely made me cleverer.

    This is one of top 5 films I ever see. Story is very strong and performances are for 20. First time I watch this movie I just keep sitting after for 10 minutes and wonder... THIS IS ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MOVIE. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant and this part is how you say made for him. There is a thin line between genius and laugh but Geoffrey is made it. The best scene is David playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3 - Helfgott's own recording of the piece is used - and the aftermath. I do not prefer this kind of music - but after the movie I got myself humming Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #3.Geoffrey Rush got an Oscar for this performance

    shine is one of the most precious movies for me, i loved it from the first sight, its screen making, acting, cast, plot, every thing is just perfect, and above all how the writer and the director handle to express such intrigued element as the sensitive characters as David Helpoffgot. the movies is very rich in the thematic perspective, at first we have David and his father relationship, a point that explain a great deal of each of both character and their psychology. David's father is a authoritative patriarchal sort of character, that can never let anything pass its borders unmarked, that's how he express all his emotion in this display of aggressive power, like his love to his son he says;"non one ever loves you more than me", to his family which he want to fix it in one dimension forever. on the other hands, we see David naturally as a fragile quite child, music is his talent and his sentimental outbreak, but some time i wander whether was his father shades on him that makes piano is the only personal expression for him. i believe that David's sensitivity and fragility is tidily linked with his musical talent; music is a powerful mean of human soul out release, it "express so completely the inexpressible" that the human heart is capable of. In contrast, we got David Helpoffgot who got this talent of musical performance,his overwhelm sensitivity is so delicate to a point that he can not merely contact to the out side world but by the music help. David fallowed his teacher's advice when he told him to "to play like there is no tomorrow", may be he did not realize that he was giving it just to the right person, because there was practically no tomorrow when David had unified with his music, and show us why pure human sentiments can not be reflected in the material world? because it's just the opposite of it. yet David dealt with it, and till now i'm most grateful for the writer to show us simply how this creature could live with such enormous power of sentiment. the uniqueness of shine that unlike all other biographical movies that it does not tells us about rising talent as usual, but about falling one. a thing more common in our unfair world than the successful ones. Finally i'm bound to comment of the last scene of the piano concert, who he manage to defeat his past, his fear and play again. his tears tell us with precious understatement that all that the real talent want on earth is the recognition of the other.

    Amazing movie. Go watch it if you haven't yet. Ugandian born (now Australian) Scott Hicks made this near masterpiece movie and actually left me willing to explore more of his works. Shine is about David Helfgott (Alex Rafalowicz, Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush). David sees since very young his life driven towards the fields of the piano. His father, visibly victimised by his austere father (Alex Rafalowicz), demands perfection from him and also extreme loyalty to him. His father sacrifices a lot of his potential in order to fulfil his desires and wills, including not allowing David to go study in the States. A few years later he receives a scholarship from the Royal College of Music in London, an opportunity which is father obviously declined. But David was already older enough and left home, what shocked his father, who decided to clear David from his family, believing his acts were a complete betrayal. Anyway, in London, David practises like an animal and reaches the complete success, winning a competition, when ha has a mental breakdown on stage. Years pass and he is forgotten, until his talent is rediscovered, by accident. Very powerful movie. Got me by surprise because I didn't knew, even during the movie that his mental illness, allied with his great talent, who be pu together so brilliantly. Geoffrey Rush received one of the most deserved Oscars the Academy has ever given. He had in my opinion what might just be his best performance of his whole career. Although works well to dramatize David's youth, it seems to me that his father is too much exaggerated, as his family say he was nothing like shown in the family. The same happens with David's quality in the piano after the breakdown, that is supposed to be a somehow worse that the movie implies. That clearly separates this movie from total perfection. Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10

    A Shining Success

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

    It is both moving, and a whimsically entertaining film to view, as Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor both demonstrate their unique performances as the well respected, but terribly ill pianist, David Helfgott. Marked with Schizoaffective disorder, an illness so damaging that it affected the very mood and form of speech of young David, up until his overall lost result, with nothing but the disease itself became the very thing left to master. Growing up in Melbourne Australia, David grew up under the care of his parents and the company of his sisters. His father Peter, stubbornly played by Armin Muellar-Stahl, taught and inspired his David to perfect his talent with the piano. He even sought for his son to learn the 3rd concerto by Rachmaninoff, yet never encouraging to leave and improve his talent beyond there little home. It was the very encouraging words of a compassionate Australian communist, Katharine Prichard, that young David (Taylor) would go to London, and study in the Royal College of Music. His desire to make his own decision caused his father to disown him, and thus further pushing him away. As young David continues to practice, the illness that soon claimed his way of life took hold, whether it was in his moments of practice, or his literal demonstration of the 3rd concerto, David lost himself in the moment. David (Rush), at a much older age, as been up and around with his life, moving from an institution to a hotel, and then to piano playing hobby in a restaurant. These are all many turns in his life, to the very point when he meets the love of his life Gillian. David's relationship with his father was a major turn in his life, as it simply ended in regretful, but a brief moment of reconcile. Peter hugged his son after years of rejection, and the burden of their tension was lifted, thus making his fathers departure from this world all the more sad, for David had to play for all those who loved him, but his father. "Shine" can't be characterized as one of the greatest bio flicks I've ever viewed, however, the performances liven up the screen with both their authentic portrayals, and the conflicts among the characters. The individual portrayals of Helfgott in his youth and mid life surprised me, with the performance of Noah Taylor, representing the tormented side of David, slowly being consumed by his dedication to music, as well that very depression the consumed him for most of his life. Geoffrey Rush portrays David at a mid age, speaking in disorganized, but arithmetic pattern of speech, changing from one subject to another, exemplifying the result of his disorder. The way Rushbrings his portrayal to life, is both enjoyable and amusing. Stahl forms a cloud of inner tension among David and his performance of Peter Helfgott, and that very tension has probably been one of the major contributions to David's illness. The film "Shine" may be a little disorganized with it's direction. The first half with a young David growing up and spiraling into a wing of depression well done, however, the remaining half of his mid life seemed rather brief for my tastes, despite the overall theme of his comeback being very inspirational. Geoffrey Rush and Stahl are very great actors that make "Shine" shine in glory.

    Scott Hicks tells a moving story of musician David Helfgott, a child prodigy who vanishes into oblivion because of a mental illness while he continues battling his inner demons. The storytelling is non-linear but it's easy to follow and the director manages to grab the viewer's attention. Hicks has used a minimal approach in execution. The sets and art direction are simplistic. The cinematography and score is subtle (except for the key instrumental pieces). The musical pieces have been used very effectively and they are featured in some of the most poignant scenes. I liked that the director doesn't manipulate the viewer's emotion too much (which is the kind of risk one would run when making a truth-based story) through melodrama or excessive glossiness. In addition, 'Shine' has some first rate performances lead wonderfully by an amazing Geoffrey Rush and a superb Noah Taylor. Rush has delivered one of the finest portrayals of a mentally ill character. They are excellently supported by Armin Muller-Stahl, Nicholas Bell and Lynn Redgrave. 'Shine' is a very human uplifiting movie. After the credits have rolled, one feels a sense of positiveness as they have just witnessed the triumph of a trapped and tortured soul.

    An incredibly captivating film that does the right thing in keeping its running time below two hours. The story of the talented pianist David Helfgott who looses his mind, much due to his father's harsh treatment, is partly based on a true story, and is arresting right from the opening scene. Geoffrey Rush won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, although he only appears for about 40 minutes of the film, and he, Alex Rafalowicz and Noah Taylor all makes for great performances as the leading man throughout his maturing life. We are naturally charmed and compelled by Helfgott and his incredible piano skills, and although the film could easily have been a downer, it's uplifting, full of wonderful humor and enjoyable.

    Rush plays the man, and does a brilliant job. Yesterday (August 2013) I saw David in person, playing the piano in a performance in Cairns. To see him in real life, and playing as brilliantly as he does, makes one realise how close the film is to his actual life. If you don't get the opportunity to see David in real life, second best is to watch this film. Of course, there is some editorial licence in the film, and it is nigh on impossible to get into a person's head and way of thinking, but the flavour is there in the film. This film has not only entertainment value, but is a pseudo documentary about the life of a still-brilliant performer. When I saw David play live, I wondered how he could remember all the music without using any sheet music, and it was obvious by his mannerisms that he is still mentally affected - nevertheless, I believe he is one of the world's best pianists.

    Shine is the real life story of David Helfgott, a gifted pianist suffering from some severe mental problems. Three different actors portray the tortured soul at three stages of his life, concluded by Geoffrey Rush's stream of consciousness and Oscar winning performance, which makes the film well worth the occasionally bumpy ride. A strict and domineering father physically beats and mentally abuses young David; all while telling him what a lucky boy he is to have a good family. After his dad forbids his travel to America, David later works up the courage to move to England to study music on scholarship. After a difficult concert, he has a nervous breakdown which leads to a stay at a mental hospital where he receives shock treatment. He recovers to some extent when he meets a woman who initially treats him as a patient and eventually marries him. The cast is outstanding, starting with Rush and with great support by Lynn Redgrave and John Gielgud. The music is also excellent.

Nevertheless, a real delight to both music lovers and fanciers of the devilries of the mental illness. 9/10

    Films about classical composers ("The Music Lovers", "Immortal Beloved") frequently portray them as tormented, unstable geniuses, and the cinema often takes a similar view of those who interpret their music, whether as musicians ("Hilary and Jackie") or as ballet dancers ("Black Swan"). Like "Hilary and Jackie", which came out two years later, "Shine" is based on the life of a real classical musician, the Australian pianist David Helfgott. The film tells the story of Helfgott's life, especially his relationship with his father Peter, his struggles against mental illness and his eventual recovery. Peter is portrayed here by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a domineering tyrant who expects total obedience from his children and who is obsessed with winning and success at all costs. (To be fair I should point out that this portrait of Peter Helfgott has been challenged by some members of his family). Once David's musical talent is discovered, Peter becomes a hard taskmaster who takes over the boy's life, forcing him to practise day and night and to tackle the most technically complex and emotionally demanding pieces, notably Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto. (It would appear that in the sixties the Rachmaninoff concertos were regarded as too daunting for students and only the most experienced pianists dared tackle them. Today, things appear to have changed. I recall that in the piano finals of a recent "Young Musician of the Year" contest in Britain five of six the finalists chose to play works by Rachmaninoff, with the sixth opting for Tchaikovsky; the commentators were left pondering why young pianists no longer want to play Mozart or Beethoven). Peter's methods have some success, because David becomes a prodigy who wins the state musical championship and is invited to study in America. Peter, however, forbids his son to leave Australia; when David accepts a subsequent invitation to study at the Royal College of Music in London his father disowns him. David's success, however, has come at too high a price, because while in London the emotional strain proves too much for him, and he suffers a mental breakdown and is committed to an institution. This was the film which first made a star of Geoffrey Rush, hitherto a little-known Australian actor. Indeed, it not only made him a star but also won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Rush was not the first Australian actor to win the award- that was Peter Finch for "Network"- but he was the first to do so for a role in an Australian film. Rush was the fifth actor in nine years to win the award for playing a character suffering from either physical or mental disabilities; the others were Dustin Hoffman ("Rain Man"), Daniel-Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot"), Al Pacino ("Scent of a Woman") and Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"). (There were also a couple of "Best Actress" awards for similar roles around this time). This phenomenon was the subject at the time of some adverse comment to the effect that such awards were being given out on the basis of political correctness, but in fact a number of the performances in question were very fine ones, and Rush's is one of the best, up there with Hoffman's, Day-Lewis's and Marlee Matlin's in "Children of a Lesser God". Rush's verbal and physical mannerisms are highly suggestive of a man not completely in control mentally, yet this is a performance which goes beyond the purely physical. The David Helfgott who shines through beneath the surface peculiarities is a sensitive man, struggling against a mental burden too great for him to bear. Of the supporting performances, those that stand out are from Noah Taylor as the teenage David, Lynn Redgrave as his wife Gillian, who played a major part in his recovery, and from Mueller-Stahl as Peter, a tyrant yet one with his own mental suffering to bear. (The Helfgott family were Polish Jews who arrived in Australia as refugees from Nazism, and it is clear that Peter's character has been scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe). There is also a good cameo from the 92-year-old Sir John Gielgud as David's teacher in England. One criticism that has been made is that the film exaggerates Helfgott's status as a pianist. Although he eventually recovered from his mental illness and was able to start giving public recitals again, most musical experts do not regard him as being among the world's greatest talents. Yet such criticism strikes me as missing the point. The aim of the film is not to claim that Helfgott now ranks alongside the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazi or Yevgeny Kissin but to show how the love of his wife and his own willpower enabled him to overcome his mental illness and to play again for audiences. That, in my view, is an aim in which it brilliantly succeeds. 9/10

    It is both moving, and a whimsically entertaining film to view, as Geoffrey Rush and Noah Taylor both demonstrate their unique performances as the well respected, but terribly ill pianist, David Helfgott. Marked with Schizoaffective disorder, an illness so damaging that it affected the very mood and form of speech of young David, up until his overall lost result, with nothing but the disease itself became the very thing left to master. Growing up in Melbourne Australia, David grew up under the care of his parents and the company of his sisters. His father Peter, stubbornly played by Armin Muellar-Stahl, taught and inspired his David to perfect his talent with the piano. He even sought for his son to learn the 3rd concerto by Rachmaninoff, yet never encouraging to leave and improve his talent beyond there little home. It was the very encouraging words of a compassionate Australian communist, Katharine Prichard, that young David (Taylor) would go to London, and study in the Royal College of Music. His desire to make his own decision caused his father to disown him, and thus further pushing him away. As young David continues to practice, the illness that soon claimed his way of life took hold, whether it was in his moments of practice, or his literal demonstration of the 3rd concerto, David lost himself in the moment. David (Rush), at a much older age, as been up and around with his life, moving from an institution to a hotel, and then to piano playing hobby in a restaurant. These are all many turns in his life, to the very point when he meets the love of his life Gillian. David's relationship with his father was a major turn in his life, as it simply ended in regretful, but a brief moment of reconcile. Peter hugged his son after years of rejection, and the burden of their tension was lifted, thus making his fathers departure from this world all the more sad, for David had to play for all those who loved him, but his father. "Shine" can't be characterized as one of the greatest bio flicks I've ever viewed, however, the performances liven up the screen with both their authentic portrayals, and the conflicts among the characters. The individual portrayals of Helfgott in his youth and mid life surprised me, with the performance of Noah Taylor, representing the tormented side of David, slowly being consumed by his dedication to music, as well that very depression the consumed him for most of his life. Geoffrey Rush portrays David at a mid age, speaking in disorganized, but arithmetic pattern of speech, changing from one subject to another, exemplifying the result of his disorder. The way Rushbrings his portrayal to life, is both enjoyable and amusing. Stahl forms a cloud of inner tension among David and his performance of Peter Helfgott, and that very tension has probably been one of the major contributions to David's illness. The film "Shine" may be a little disorganized with it's direction. The first half with a young David growing up and spiraling into a wing of depression well done, however, the remaining half of his mid life seemed rather brief for my tastes, despite the overall theme of his comeback being very inspirational. Geoffrey Rush and Stahl are very great actors that make "Shine" shine in glory.

    Scott Hicks tells a moving story of musician David Helfgott, a child prodigy who vanishes into oblivion because of a mental illness while he continues battling his inner demons. The storytelling is non-linear but it's easy to follow and the director manages to grab the viewer's attention. Hicks has used a minimal approach in execution. The sets and art direction are simplistic. The cinematography and score is subtle (except for the key instrumental pieces). The musical pieces have been used very effectively and they are featured in some of the most poignant scenes. I liked that the director doesn't manipulate the viewer's emotion too much (which is the kind of risk one would run when making a truth-based story) through melodrama or excessive glossiness. In addition, 'Shine' has some first rate performances lead wonderfully by an amazing Geoffrey Rush and a superb Noah Taylor. Rush has delivered one of the finest portrayals of a mentally ill character. They are excellently supported by Armin Muller-Stahl, Nicholas Bell and Lynn Redgrave. 'Shine' is a very human uplifiting movie. After the credits have rolled, one feels a sense of positiveness as they have just witnessed the triumph of a trapped and tortured soul.

    An incredibly captivating film that does the right thing in keeping its running time below two hours. The story of the talented pianist David Helfgott who looses his mind, much due to his father's harsh treatment, is partly based on a true story, and is arresting right from the opening scene. Geoffrey Rush won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, although he only appears for about 40 minutes of the film, and he, Alex Rafalowicz and Noah Taylor all makes for great performances as the leading man throughout his maturing life. We are naturally charmed and compelled by Helfgott and his incredible piano skills, and although the film could easily have been a downer, it's uplifting, full of wonderful humor and enjoyable.
