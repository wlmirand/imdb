 <sinopse>
  An unimpressive, every-day man is forced into a situation where he is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Gene Watson is a public accountant who arrives on a train at Union Station in Los Angeles, accompanied by his 6-year-old daughter Lynn. Because of his ordinary looks, he is approached by a pair of sinister people named Smith and Jones. Pretending to be cops, Smith and Jones kidnap Lynn and confront Gene with a simple choice -- kill California governor Eleanor Grant in 90 minutes or less, or Lynn will die. Watson is given a gun, six bullets, and a name tag, and he is told to go to the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and kill Eleanor, who is giving an afternoon speech. While Jones is watching Lynn in a van, Smith watches Watson in order to prevent Watson from alerting the authorities. Watson must quickly find some way to get himself and Lynn out of this seemingly impossible situation.

    Previously, when initially released in 1995 and in years following, I was a huge fan of Nick of Time. I had loved Johnny Depp's straight man performance, even though in 1995, he hadn't gone all crazy-role just yet. It's been probably well over a decade since I've last seen this movie and back in the 1990s, I had seen it multiple times. Today, it somewhat holds up. I still like Johnny in a non-looney role  ironically, I think he's trying too over-the-top for his past decade roles in order to be original, and yet, it might actually be original for him to return to this kind of character. I also appreciate Christopher Walken in pretty much anything, including this and always have liked Roma Maffia. I dig that chick. The movie cannot be taken seriously and you might enjoy it a little more. I don't think they were trying for anything too heavy and as a short and tight thriller with actual decent performances (not mentioned above, but still good, was shoe-shinning Charles S. Dutton,) it's entertaining. Pre-24 days, everyday man, Gene (Depp,) travels via train with his daughter when they're approached and coerced into assassinating the Governor at a nearby hotel and rally. Basically, and the plot is basic, two parties, Walken's Mr. Smith and Maffia's Mrs. Smith are watching Gene and his daughter, respectively and separately. Gene can't go to the police because bad man Mr. Smith's got eyes everywhere and his daughter is unaware she's in danger. Oh, and he's got 90 minutes to get close to and kill the Governor, or his daughter dies. Probably him, too. On the surface  or from a distance, the premise seems exciting and thrilling. And for the most part, the ingeniousness of Gene to handle something, including a gun, that he's never had to before, was pretty entertaining. But, once watched, it does show a little bit of B-movie qualities that reminds us again: don't take this seriously. Sure, I recommend it, but if I watched it for the first time today, I probably wouldn't have seen it the many times I did back in the 1990s.

    The clock is ticking for Johnny Depp in Nick of Time, a twist-filled, race-against-time thriller directed by John Badham. And indeed it is a race, filmed in "real time" so that on screen events unfold minute by nail-biting minute as they would in real life.Christopher Walken, Charles S. Dutton and Courtney Chase co-stars in this film. A stranger pulled into a deadly scheme races against time to save his daughter in this thriller. Gene Watson is an accountant who comes to L.A. with his ten-year-old daughter Lynn to attend a funeral. On the street, Gene and Lynn are pulled aside by Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones, who flash what look like police badges and usher them into a van. Gene soon discovers that he's been kidnapped, and his captors have an unusual demand that is if Gene does not murder Gov. Eleanor Grant within 75 minutes, his daughter will be killed. Gene now has just an hour and a quarter to tip off the authorities, spare Gov. Grant, and find out what Smith and Jones are trying to do, along with saving his daughter's life. He finds a much-needed ally in one-legged shoe-shine man Huey. This is a fast and furious 90 minutes that doesn't waste a second.Also,it is an exciting albeit illogical tale of mystery and suspense.Unfortunately,this is an average movie that was saved by the excellent performances of the cast particularly Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken. Aside from that,the plot is clich&eacute;d and predictable as well as it has been already seen in many movies before even with "real time" involved in the premise.

    Another "thriller" that offers little suspense. Depp tries to make this work. He can't. Walken barely walks through this, undoubtedly because he knew there was little point after seeing just how poor a job the screenwriter did on this movie. Gloria Reuben and the rest of the cast are wasted, as well. The premise would stretch credulity in the hands of a master director. Badham is NOT that (though he did a decent job with "Point of No Return" in 1993). Save your time and money. Watch the Bridget Fonda flick I just mentioned. Or try "No Way Out" or its predecessor "The Big Clock" if you want something old school. Just don't bother with this.

    Johnny Depp as your average Joe C.P.A.? Naw, say it isn't so. Isn't this the guy who rose to fame with strange robotic blades for fingers, with an eye-patch and catchy phrases, with a reputation for playing the strange and unusual? Well, the role may not be strange or unusual, but the movie certainly is. For one thing, it is extremely rare for a 90 minute movie to actually happen in 90 minutes. But Nick of Time is about the occurrences in Gene Watson's life over a span of 90 minutes. Christopher Walken shines as the SOB cop/assassin who manipulates Depp's character, and Roma Maffia excels as his partner. I think the most interesting aspect of this film is combining two powerful character actors (Depp and Walken) across from each other. The action is fast and non-stop, and the tension builds throughout the film. When Depp finally finds help in the form of Charles S. Dutton, a shoe shine man in the lobby of the Bonaventure, the help comes in the strangest way. Rated R for violence and language, this is a interesting, breakneck paced film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

    Johnny Depp has always been an extraordinary actor in all stages of his shining career and the rather unknown "Nick Of Time" is a great example to underline this thesis. The movie is a good thriller in real time as the series "24" for example and introduces many interesting and intriguing characters on both the good and the evil side. With every minute, the tension rises and you will watch this movie on the edge of your seat without any boring moments. The only weak point of the movie is that there aren't too many surprises in the end and that the ending is rather mainstream and predictable but the rest is truly great from the acting and the characters to the dialogues and the fighting and killing scenes. If you are a fan of Johnny Depp or short and sweet action thrillers, you should definitely check out this movie. It's nothing new or original but highly intensive and interesting even after several tries.

    I'd like to say that although the script was horrible at least Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken made the film worth a watch. We're talking about two fine American actors here. But, even if you've enjoyed every performance you've ever seen from Johnny Depp or Christopher Walken, take a pass on this movie. I've never seen a more uninspired performance from either of them. Ever. As for the script here's the deal - Some people who are politically connected want a certain governor dead. These are high powered people with serious money and inside connections with law enforcement. It would be very difficult to stop them. Well, unless of course their plan was "Let's grab some random stranger off a train, kidnap his daughter and blackmail him into killing the governor for us." Yea, that's gonna work. The Three Stooges in a Banana Republic might come up with a assassination scheme like this. It still wouldn't work, but at least it would be more fun to watch. I won't spoil it for you and tell you how things work out for Johnny Depp and his daughter but then again, do I really have to? And what's up with all the revolvers? I haven't seen this many revolvers in a film since the Dirty Harry films in the 1970's.

    John Badham's 'Nick Of Time' is one of those films, which entertain while being played & soon become forgettable. A film where entertainment remains intact, where escapism takes charge. 'Nick Of Time' has a gripping plot & the prolific filmmaker handles the subject well. The climax, especially, is very gripping & interesting. Roy H. Wagner's Cinematography is top-notch. Coming to acting, Johnny Depp is in terrific form. He's brilliant in each & every frame & steals the show. Christopher Walken is, as always, superb. Marsha Mason as Gov. Eleanor Grant is excellent. Courtney Chase is adorable as Depp's daughter. Charles S. Dutton shines in a likable role. Others lend able support. A Hindi Film called 'Badshah' was made years after this film released, which was a yawn. Watch 'Nick Of Time' because it keeps you entertained in those 88 minutes.

    Are you kidding me? Thank goodness I'm watching this film in 2009 (post 9/11) and not 1995 when it came out because it's supposed to be a thriller and I'm laughing my bottom off like it's comedy. This film makes a mockery of Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken's talents as actors, it's a shocker to me that they even agreed to read the script let alone act in such fluff. Like most recent reviewers, I am catching up on Johnny Depp movies and I just have to say that this one in a clunker along an otherwise smooth road. Stupid Plot, stupid, stupid, stupid. The script should have been used to scoop up kitty litter rather than wasting money by making it into a film.

    Great cast with a bit of a far fetched quite annoying storyline. The beginning was very weak, picking some random person at an airport to kill the governor. If you can get past the fact that the governors husband and his team of security are so well organized to arrange the whole assassination and leave main key principle in the equation (the hit-man ) to a complete stranger who they know nothing about. Look past these points and sit back a watch then you can get through the movie and arrive at the end and think " that's not so bad " But on reflection it was. Clips with a shoe shine man with one false leg getting totally involved to help out and eventually getting shot, fortunately in his bad leg, which he then whacks one of the bad guys and knock her out with the false leg which she had just shot off. ( please !) Again this is my opinion. I read other reviews that people love this movie. Well ! we are not all the same.

    The cast, the crew (I guess), the props, the set, the acting were all fine, it was just the story that was sorely lacking. We all have to suspend our disbelief to a certain extent when watching a movie, but we shouldn't be asked to work quite so hard at it. Right from the git-go, to think that a professional "hit" squad would relinquish all control of their upcoming, VERY high profile job to a complete stranger, strains credulity to it's breaking point. That and one fortunate coincidence after another (like finding a capable, former soldier, who not only believes a very fantastic tale, but is willing and able to IMMEDIATELY arrange numerous details to save everyone's life)just constantly reminds you that this flimsy story couldn't possibly be really happening. So, nice try, but next time, strive for a teensy bit more believability, huh?

I still like Johnny in a non-looney role  ironically, I think he's trying too over-the-top for his past decade roles in order to be original, and yet, it might actually be original for him to return to this kind of character. I also appreciate Christopher Walken in pretty much anything, including this and always have liked Roma Maffia. I dig that chick. The movie cannot be taken seriously and you might enjoy it a little more. I don't think they were trying for anything too heavy and as a short and tight thriller with actual decent performances (not mentioned above, but still good, was shoe-shinning Charles S. Dutton,) it's entertaining. Pre-24 days, everyday man, Gene (Depp,) travels via train with his daughter when they're approached and coerced into assassinating the Governor at a nearby hotel and rally. Basically, and the plot is basic, two parties, Walken's Mr. Smith and Maffia's Mrs. Smith are watching Gene and his daughter, respectively and separately. Gene can't go to the police because bad man Mr. Smith's got eyes everywhere and his daughter is unaware she's in danger. Oh, and he's got 90 minutes to get close to and kill the Governor, or his daughter dies. Probably him, too. On the surface  or from a distance, the premise seems exciting and thrilling. And for the most part, the ingeniousness of Gene to handle something, including a gun, that he's never had to before, was pretty entertaining. But, once watched, it does show a little bit of B-movie qualities that reminds us again: don't take this seriously. Sure, I recommend it, but if I watched it for the first time today, I probably wouldn't have seen it the many times I did back in the 1990s.

    The clock is ticking for Johnny Depp in Nick of Time, a twist-filled, race-against-time thriller directed by John Badham. And indeed it is a race, filmed in "real time" so that on screen events unfold minute by nail-biting minute as they would in real life.Christopher Walken, Charles S. Dutton and Courtney Chase co-stars in this film. A stranger pulled into a deadly scheme races against time to save his daughter in this thriller. Gene Watson is an accountant who comes to L.A. with his ten-year-old daughter Lynn to attend a funeral. On the street, Gene and Lynn are pulled aside by Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones, who flash what look like police badges and usher them into a van. Gene soon discovers that he's been kidnapped, and his captors have an unusual demand that is if Gene does not murder Gov. Eleanor Grant within 75 minutes, his daughter will be killed. Gene now has just an hour and a quarter to tip off the authorities, spare Gov. Grant, and find out what Smith and Jones are trying to do, along with saving his daughter's life. He finds a much-needed ally in one-legged shoe-shine man Huey. This is a fast and furious 90 minutes that doesn't waste a second.Also,it is an exciting albeit illogical tale of mystery and suspense.Unfortunately,this is an average movie that was saved by the excellent performances of the cast particularly Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken. Aside from that,the plot is clich&eacute;d and predictable as well as it has been already seen in many movies before even with "real time" involved in the premise.

    Another "thriller" that offers little suspense. Depp tries to make this work. He can't. Walken barely walks through this, undoubtedly because he knew there was little point after seeing just how poor a job the screenwriter did on this movie. Gloria Reuben and the rest of the cast are wasted, as well. The premise would stretch credulity in the hands of a master director. Badham is NOT that (though he did a decent job with "Point of No Return" in 1993). Save your time and money. Watch the Bridget Fonda flick I just mentioned. Or try "No Way Out" or its predecessor "The Big Clock" if you want something old school. Just don't bother with this.

    Johnny Depp as your average Joe C.P.A.? Naw, say it isn't so. Isn't this the guy who rose to fame with strange robotic blades for fingers, with an eye-patch and catchy phrases, with a reputation for playing the strange and unusual? Well, the role may not be strange or unusual, but the movie certainly is. For one thing, it is extremely rare for a 90 minute movie to actually happen in 90 minutes. But Nick of Time is about the occurrences in Gene Watson's life over a span of 90 minutes. Christopher Walken shines as the SOB cop/assassin who manipulates Depp's character, and Roma Maffia excels as his partner. I think the most interesting aspect of this film is combining two powerful character actors (Depp and Walken) across from each other. The action is fast and non-stop, and the tension builds throughout the film. When Depp finally finds help in the form of Charles S. Dutton, a shoe shine man in the lobby of the Bonaventure, the help comes in the strangest way. Rated R for violence and language, this is a interesting, breakneck paced film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

    Johnny Depp has always been an extraordinary actor in all stages of his shining career and the rather unknown "Nick Of Time" is a great example to underline this thesis. The movie is a good thriller in real time as the series "24" for example and introduces many interesting and intriguing characters on both the good and the evil side. With every minute, the tension rises and you will watch this movie on the edge of your seat without any boring moments. The only weak point of the movie is that there aren't too many surprises in the end and that the ending is rather mainstream and predictable but the rest is truly great from the acting and the characters to the dialogues and the fighting and killing scenes. If you are a fan of Johnny Depp or short and sweet action thrillers, you should definitely check out this movie. It's nothing new or original but highly intensive and interesting even after several tries.

    I'd like to say that although the script was horrible at least Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken made the film worth a watch. We're talking about two fine American actors here. But, even if you've enjoyed every performance you've ever seen from Johnny Depp or Christopher Walken, take a pass on this movie. I've never seen a more uninspired performance from either of them. Ever. As for the script here's the deal - Some people who are politically connected want a certain governor dead. These are high powered people with serious money and inside connections with law enforcement. It would be very difficult to stop them. Well, unless of course their plan was "Let's grab some random stranger off a train, kidnap his daughter and blackmail him into killing the governor for us." Yea, that's gonna work. The Three Stooges in a Banana Republic might come up with a assassination scheme like this. It still wouldn't work, but at least it would be more fun to watch. I won't spoil it for you and tell you how things work out for Johnny Depp and his daughter but then again, do I really have to? And what's up with all the revolvers? I haven't seen this many revolvers in a film since the Dirty Harry films in the 1970's.

    John Badham's 'Nick Of Time' is one of those films, which entertain while being played & soon become forgettable. A film where entertainment remains intact, where escapism takes charge. 'Nick Of Time' has a gripping plot & the prolific filmmaker handles the subject well. The climax, especially, is very gripping & interesting. Roy H. Wagner's Cinematography is top-notch. Coming to acting, Johnny Depp is in terrific form. He's brilliant in each & every frame & steals the show. Christopher Walken is, as always, superb. Marsha Mason as Gov. Eleanor Grant is excellent. Courtney Chase is adorable as Depp's daughter. Charles S. Dutton shines in a likable role. Others lend able support. A Hindi Film called 'Badshah' was made years after this film released, which was a yawn. Watch 'Nick Of Time' because it keeps you entertained in those 88 minutes.

    Are you kidding me? Thank goodness I'm watching this film in 2009 (post 9/11) and not 1995 when it came out because it's supposed to be a thriller and I'm laughing my bottom off like it's comedy. This film makes a mockery of Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken's talents as actors, it's a shocker to me that they even agreed to read the script let alone act in such fluff. Like most recent reviewers, I am catching up on Johnny Depp movies and I just have to say that this one in a clunker along an otherwise smooth road. Stupid Plot, stupid, stupid, stupid. The script should have been used to scoop up kitty litter rather than wasting money by making it into a film.

    Great cast with a bit of a far fetched quite annoying storyline. The beginning was very weak, picking some random person at an airport to kill the governor. If you can get past the fact that the governors husband and his team of security are so well organized to arrange the whole assassination and leave main key principle in the equation (the hit-man ) to a complete stranger who they know nothing about. Look past these points and sit back a watch then you can get through the movie and arrive at the end and think " that's not so bad " But on reflection it was. Clips with a shoe shine man with one false leg getting totally involved to help out and eventually getting shot, fortunately in his bad leg, which he then whacks one of the bad guys and knock her out with the false leg which she had just shot off. ( please !) Again this is my opinion. I read other reviews that people love this movie. Well ! we are not all the same.

    The cast, the crew (I guess), the props, the set, the acting were all fine, it was just the story that was sorely lacking. We all have to suspend our disbelief to a certain extent when watching a movie, but we shouldn't be asked to work quite so hard at it. Right from the git-go, to think that a professional "hit" squad would relinquish all control of their upcoming, VERY high profile job to a complete stranger, strains credulity to it's breaking point. That and one fortunate coincidence after another (like finding a capable, former soldier, who not only believes a very fantastic tale, but is willing and able to IMMEDIATELY arrange numerous details to save everyone's life)just constantly reminds you that this flimsy story couldn't possibly be really happening. So, nice try, but next time, strive for a teensy bit more believability, huh?

    The clock is ticking for Johnny Depp in Nick of Time, a twist-filled, race-against-time thriller directed by John Badham. And indeed it is a race, filmed in "real time" so that on screen events unfold minute by nail-biting minute as they would in real life.Christopher Walken, Charles S. Dutton and Courtney Chase co-stars in this film. A stranger pulled into a deadly scheme races against time to save his daughter in this thriller. Gene Watson is an accountant who comes to L.A. with his ten-year-old daughter Lynn to attend a funeral. On the street, Gene and Lynn are pulled aside by Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones, who flash what look like police badges and usher them into a van. Gene soon discovers that he's been kidnapped, and his captors have an unusual demand that is if Gene does not murder Gov. Eleanor Grant within 75 minutes, his daughter will be killed. Gene now has just an hour and a quarter to tip off the authorities, spare Gov. Grant, and find out what Smith and Jones are trying to do, along with saving his daughter's life. He finds a much-needed ally in one-legged shoe-shine man Huey. This is a fast and furious 90 minutes that doesn't waste a second.Also,it is an exciting albeit illogical tale of mystery and suspense.Unfortunately,this is an average movie that was saved by the excellent performances of the cast particularly Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken. Aside from that,the plot is clich&eacute;d and predictable as well as it has been already seen in many movies before even with "real time" involved in the premise.

    Another "thriller" that offers little suspense. Depp tries to make this work. He can't. Walken barely walks through this, undoubtedly because he knew there was little point after seeing just how poor a job the screenwriter did on this movie. Gloria Reuben and the rest of the cast are wasted, as well. The premise would stretch credulity in the hands of a master director. Badham is NOT that (though he did a decent job with "Point of No Return" in 1993). Save your time and money. Watch the Bridget Fonda flick I just mentioned. Or try "No Way Out" or its predecessor "The Big Clock" if you want something old school. Just don't bother with this.

    Johnny Depp as your average Joe C.P.A.? Naw, say it isn't so. Isn't this the guy who rose to fame with strange robotic blades for fingers, with an eye-patch and catchy phrases, with a reputation for playing the strange and unusual? Well, the role may not be strange or unusual, but the movie certainly is. For one thing, it is extremely rare for a 90 minute movie to actually happen in 90 minutes. But Nick of Time is about the occurrences in Gene Watson's life over a span of 90 minutes. Christopher Walken shines as the SOB cop/assassin who manipulates Depp's character, and Roma Maffia excels as his partner. I think the most interesting aspect of this film is combining two powerful character actors (Depp and Walken) across from each other. The action is fast and non-stop, and the tension builds throughout the film. When Depp finally finds help in the form of Charles S. Dutton, a shoe shine man in the lobby of the Bonaventure, the help comes in the strangest way. Rated R for violence and language, this is a interesting, breakneck paced film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

    Johnny Depp has always been an extraordinary actor in all stages of his shining career and the rather unknown "Nick Of Time" is a great example to underline this thesis. The movie is a good thriller in real time as the series "24" for example and introduces many interesting and intriguing characters on both the good and the evil side. With every minute, the tension rises and you will watch this movie on the edge of your seat without any boring moments. The only weak point of the movie is that there aren't too many surprises in the end and that the ending is rather mainstream and predictable but the rest is truly great from the acting and the characters to the dialogues and the fighting and killing scenes. If you are a fan of Johnny Depp or short and sweet action thrillers, you should definitely check out this movie. It's nothing new or original but highly intensive and interesting even after several tries.

    I'd like to say that although the script was horrible at least Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken made the film worth a watch. We're talking about two fine American actors here. But, even if you've enjoyed every performance you've ever seen from Johnny Depp or Christopher Walken, take a pass on this movie. I've never seen a more uninspired performance from either of them. Ever. As for the script here's the deal - Some people who are politically connected want a certain governor dead. These are high powered people with serious money and inside connections with law enforcement. It would be very difficult to stop them. Well, unless of course their plan was "Let's grab some random stranger off a train, kidnap his daughter and blackmail him into killing the governor for us." Yea, that's gonna work. The Three Stooges in a Banana Republic might come up with a assassination scheme like this. It still wouldn't work, but at least it would be more fun to watch. I won't spoil it for you and tell you how things work out for Johnny Depp and his daughter but then again, do I really have to? And what's up with all the revolvers? I haven't seen this many revolvers in a film since the Dirty Harry films in the 1970's.

    John Badham's 'Nick Of Time' is one of those films, which entertain while being played & soon become forgettable. A film where entertainment remains intact, where escapism takes charge. 'Nick Of Time' has a gripping plot & the prolific filmmaker handles the subject well. The climax, especially, is very gripping & interesting. Roy H. Wagner's Cinematography is top-notch. Coming to acting, Johnny Depp is in terrific form. He's brilliant in each & every frame & steals the show. Christopher Walken is, as always, superb. Marsha Mason as Gov. Eleanor Grant is excellent. Courtney Chase is adorable as Depp's daughter. Charles S. Dutton shines in a likable role. Others lend able support. A Hindi Film called 'Badshah' was made years after this film released, which was a yawn. Watch 'Nick Of Time' because it keeps you entertained in those 88 minutes.

    Are you kidding me? Thank goodness I'm watching this film in 2009 (post 9/11) and not 1995 when it came out because it's supposed to be a thriller and I'm laughing my bottom off like it's comedy. This film makes a mockery of Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken's talents as actors, it's a shocker to me that they even agreed to read the script let alone act in such fluff. Like most recent reviewers, I am catching up on Johnny Depp movies and I just have to say that this one in a clunker along an otherwise smooth road. Stupid Plot, stupid, stupid, stupid. The script should have been used to scoop up kitty litter rather than wasting money by making it into a film.

    Great cast with a bit of a far fetched quite annoying storyline. The beginning was very weak, picking some random person at an airport to kill the governor. If you can get past the fact that the governors husband and his team of security are so well organized to arrange the whole assassination and leave main key principle in the equation (the hit-man ) to a complete stranger who they know nothing about. Look past these points and sit back a watch then you can get through the movie and arrive at the end and think " that's not so bad " But on reflection it was. Clips with a shoe shine man with one false leg getting totally involved to help out and eventually getting shot, fortunately in his bad leg, which he then whacks one of the bad guys and knock her out with the false leg which she had just shot off. ( please !) Again this is my opinion. I read other reviews that people love this movie. Well ! we are not all the same.

    The cast, the crew (I guess), the props, the set, the acting were all fine, it was just the story that was sorely lacking. We all have to suspend our disbelief to a certain extent when watching a movie, but we shouldn't be asked to work quite so hard at it. Right from the git-go, to think that a professional "hit" squad would relinquish all control of their upcoming, VERY high profile job to a complete stranger, strains credulity to it's breaking point. That and one fortunate coincidence after another (like finding a capable, former soldier, who not only believes a very fantastic tale, but is willing and able to IMMEDIATELY arrange numerous details to save everyone's life)just constantly reminds you that this flimsy story couldn't possibly be really happening. So, nice try, but next time, strive for a teensy bit more believability, huh?

    Previously, when initially released in 1995 and in years following, I was a huge fan of Nick of Time. I had loved Johnny Depp's straight man performance, even though in 1995, he hadn't gone all crazy-role just yet. It's been probably well over a decade since I've last seen this movie and back in the 1990s, I had seen it multiple times. Today, it somewhat holds up. I still like Johnny in a non-looney role  ironically, I think he's trying too over-the-top for his past decade roles in order to be original, and yet, it might actually be original for him to return to this kind of character. I also appreciate Christopher Walken in pretty much anything, including this and always have liked Roma Maffia. I dig that chick. The movie cannot be taken seriously and you might enjoy it a little more. I don't think they were trying for anything too heavy and as a short and tight thriller with actual decent performances (not mentioned above, but still good, was shoe-shinning Charles S. Dutton,) it's entertaining. Pre-24 days, everyday man, Gene (Depp,) travels via train with his daughter when they're approached and coerced into assassinating the Governor at a nearby hotel and rally. Basically, and the plot is basic, two parties, Walken's Mr. Smith and Maffia's Mrs. Smith are watching Gene and his daughter, respectively and separately. Gene can't go to the police because bad man Mr. Smith's got eyes everywhere and his daughter is unaware she's in danger. Oh, and he's got 90 minutes to get close to and kill the Governor, or his daughter dies. Probably him, too. On the surface  or from a distance, the premise seems exciting and thrilling. And for the most part, the ingeniousness of Gene to handle something, including a gun, that he's never had to before, was pretty entertaining. But, once watched, it does show a little bit of B-movie qualities that reminds us again: don't take this seriously. Sure, I recommend it, but if I watched it for the first time today, I probably wouldn't have seen it the many times I did back in the 1990s.

    The clock is ticking for Johnny Depp in Nick of Time, a twist-filled, race-against-time thriller directed by John Badham. And indeed it is a race, filmed in "real time" so that on screen events unfold minute by nail-biting minute as they would in real life.Christopher Walken, Charles S. Dutton and Courtney Chase co-stars in this film. A stranger pulled into a deadly scheme races against time to save his daughter in this thriller. Gene Watson is an accountant who comes to L.A. with his ten-year-old daughter Lynn to attend a funeral. On the street, Gene and Lynn are pulled aside by Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones, who flash what look like police badges and usher them into a van. Gene soon discovers that he's been kidnapped, and his captors have an unusual demand that is if Gene does not murder Gov. Eleanor Grant within 75 minutes, his daughter will be killed.

Dutton, a shoe shine man in the lobby of the Bonaventure, the help comes in the strangest way. Rated R for violence and language, this is a interesting, breakneck paced film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

    Johnny Depp has always been an extraordinary actor in all stages of his shining career and the rather unknown "Nick Of Time" is a great example to underline this thesis. The movie is a good thriller in real time as the series "24" for example and introduces many interesting and intriguing characters on both the good and the evil side. With every minute, the tension rises and you will watch this movie on the edge of your seat without any boring moments. The only weak point of the movie is that there aren't too many surprises in the end and that the ending is rather mainstream and predictable but the rest is truly great from the acting and the characters to the dialogues and the fighting and killing scenes. If you are a fan of Johnny Depp or short and sweet action thrillers, you should definitely check out this movie. It's nothing new or original but highly intensive and interesting even after several tries.

    I'd like to say that although the script was horrible at least Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken made the film worth a watch. We're talking about two fine American actors here. But, even if you've enjoyed every performance you've ever seen from Johnny Depp or Christopher Walken, take a pass on this movie. I've never seen a more uninspired performance from either of them. Ever. As for the script here's the deal - Some people who are politically connected want a certain governor dead. These are high powered people with serious money and inside connections with law enforcement. It would be very difficult to stop them. Well, unless of course their plan was "Let's grab some random stranger off a train, kidnap his daughter and blackmail him into killing the governor for us." Yea, that's gonna work. The Three Stooges in a Banana Republic might come up with a assassination scheme like this. It still wouldn't work, but at least it would be more fun to watch. I won't spoil it for you and tell you how things work out for Johnny Depp and his daughter but then again, do I really have to? And what's up with all the revolvers? I haven't seen this many revolvers in a film since the Dirty Harry films in the 1970's.

    John Badham's 'Nick Of Time' is one of those films, which entertain while being played & soon become forgettable. A film where entertainment remains intact, where escapism takes charge. 'Nick Of Time' has a gripping plot & the prolific filmmaker handles the subject well. The climax, especially, is very gripping & interesting. Roy H. Wagner's Cinematography is top-notch. Coming to acting, Johnny Depp is in terrific form. He's brilliant in each & every frame & steals the show. Christopher Walken is, as always, superb. Marsha Mason as Gov. Eleanor Grant is excellent. Courtney Chase is adorable as Depp's daughter. Charles S. Dutton shines in a likable role. Others lend able support. A Hindi Film called 'Badshah' was made years after this film released, which was a yawn. Watch 'Nick Of Time' because it keeps you entertained in those 88 minutes.

    Are you kidding me? Thank goodness I'm watching this film in 2009 (post 9/11) and not 1995 when it came out because it's supposed to be a thriller and I'm laughing my bottom off like it's comedy. This film makes a mockery of Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken's talents as actors, it's a shocker to me that they even agreed to read the script let alone act in such fluff. Like most recent reviewers, I am catching up on Johnny Depp movies and I just have to say that this one in a clunker along an otherwise smooth road. Stupid Plot, stupid, stupid, stupid. The script should have been used to scoop up kitty litter rather than wasting money by making it into a film.

    Great cast with a bit of a far fetched quite annoying storyline. The beginning was very weak, picking some random person at an airport to kill the governor. If you can get past the fact that the governors husband and his team of security are so well organized to arrange the whole assassination and leave main key principle in the equation (the hit-man ) to a complete stranger who they know nothing about. Look past these points and sit back a watch then you can get through the movie and arrive at the end and think " that's not so bad " But on reflection it was. Clips with a shoe shine man with one false leg getting totally involved to help out and eventually getting shot, fortunately in his bad leg, which he then whacks one of the bad guys and knock her out with the false leg which she had just shot off. ( please !) Again this is my opinion. I read other reviews that people love this movie. Well ! we are not all the same.

    The cast, the crew (I guess), the props, the set, the acting were all fine, it was just the story that was sorely lacking. We all have to suspend our disbelief to a certain extent when watching a movie, but we shouldn't be asked to work quite so hard at it. Right from the git-go, to think that a professional "hit" squad would relinquish all control of their upcoming, VERY high profile job to a complete stranger, strains credulity to it's breaking point. That and one fortunate coincidence after another (like finding a capable, former soldier, who not only believes a very fantastic tale, but is willing and able to IMMEDIATELY arrange numerous details to save everyone's life)just constantly reminds you that this flimsy story couldn't possibly be really happening. So, nice try, but next time, strive for a teensy bit more believability, huh?

    Previously, when initially released in 1995 and in years following, I was a huge fan of Nick of Time. I had loved Johnny Depp's straight man performance, even though in 1995, he hadn't gone all crazy-role just yet. It's been probably well over a decade since I've last seen this movie and back in the 1990s, I had seen it multiple times. Today, it somewhat holds up. I still like Johnny in a non-looney role  ironically, I think he's trying too over-the-top for his past decade roles in order to be original, and yet, it might actually be original for him to return to this kind of character. I also appreciate Christopher Walken in pretty much anything, including this and always have liked Roma Maffia. I dig that chick. The movie cannot be taken seriously and you might enjoy it a little more. I don't think they were trying for anything too heavy and as a short and tight thriller with actual decent performances (not mentioned above, but still good, was shoe-shinning Charles S. Dutton,) it's entertaining. Pre-24 days, everyday man, Gene (Depp,) travels via train with his daughter when they're approached and coerced into assassinating the Governor at a nearby hotel and rally. Basically, and the plot is basic, two parties, Walken's Mr. Smith and Maffia's Mrs. Smith are watching Gene and his daughter, respectively and separately. Gene can't go to the police because bad man Mr. Smith's got eyes everywhere and his daughter is unaware she's in danger. Oh, and he's got 90 minutes to get close to and kill the Governor, or his daughter dies. Probably him, too. On the surface  or from a distance, the premise seems exciting and thrilling. And for the most part, the ingeniousness of Gene to handle something, including a gun, that he's never had to before, was pretty entertaining. But, once watched, it does show a little bit of B-movie qualities that reminds us again: don't take this seriously. Sure, I recommend it, but if I watched it for the first time today, I probably wouldn't have seen it the many times I did back in the 1990s.

    The clock is ticking for Johnny Depp in Nick of Time, a twist-filled, race-against-time thriller directed by John Badham. And indeed it is a race, filmed in "real time" so that on screen events unfold minute by nail-biting minute as they would in real life.Christopher Walken, Charles S. Dutton and Courtney Chase co-stars in this film. A stranger pulled into a deadly scheme races against time to save his daughter in this thriller. Gene Watson is an accountant who comes to L.A. with his ten-year-old daughter Lynn to attend a funeral. On the street, Gene and Lynn are pulled aside by Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones, who flash what look like police badges and usher them into a van. Gene soon discovers that he's been kidnapped, and his captors have an unusual demand that is if Gene does not murder Gov. Eleanor Grant within 75 minutes, his daughter will be killed. Gene now has just an hour and a quarter to tip off the authorities, spare Gov. Grant, and find out what Smith and Jones are trying to do, along with saving his daughter's life. He finds a much-needed ally in one-legged shoe-shine man Huey. This is a fast and furious 90 minutes that doesn't waste a second.Also,it is an exciting albeit illogical tale of mystery and suspense.Unfortunately,this is an average movie that was saved by the excellent performances of the cast particularly Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken. Aside from that,the plot is clich&eacute;d and predictable as well as it has been already seen in many movies before even with "real time" involved in the premise.

    Another "thriller" that offers little suspense. Depp tries to make this work. He can't. Walken barely walks through this, undoubtedly because he knew there was little point after seeing just how poor a job the screenwriter did on this movie. Gloria Reuben and the rest of the cast are wasted, as well. The premise would stretch credulity in the hands of a master director. Badham is NOT that (though he did a decent job with "Point of No Return" in 1993). Save your time and money. Watch the Bridget Fonda flick I just mentioned. Or try "No Way Out" or its predecessor "The Big Clock" if you want something old school. Just don't bother with this.

    Johnny Depp as your average Joe C.P.A.? Naw, say it isn't so. Isn't this the guy who rose to fame with strange robotic blades for fingers, with an eye-patch and catchy phrases, with a reputation for playing the strange and unusual? Well, the role may not be strange or unusual, but the movie certainly is. For one thing, it is extremely rare for a 90 minute movie to actually happen in 90 minutes. But Nick of Time is about the occurrences in Gene Watson's life over a span of 90 minutes. Christopher Walken shines as the SOB cop/assassin who manipulates Depp's character, and Roma Maffia excels as his partner. I think the most interesting aspect of this film is combining two powerful character actors (Depp and Walken) across from each other. The action is fast and non-stop, and the tension builds throughout the film. When Depp finally finds help in the form of Charles S.

    John Badham's 'Nick Of Time' is one of those films, which entertain while being played & soon become forgettable. A film where entertainment remains intact, where escapism takes charge. 'Nick Of Time' has a gripping plot & the prolific filmmaker handles the subject well. The climax, especially, is very gripping & interesting. Roy H. Wagner's Cinematography is top-notch. Coming to acting, Johnny Depp is in terrific form. He's brilliant in each & every frame & steals the show. Christopher Walken is, as always, superb. Marsha Mason as Gov. Eleanor Grant is excellent. Courtney Chase is adorable as Depp's daughter. Charles S. Dutton shines in a likable role. Others lend able support. A Hindi Film called 'Badshah' was made years after this film released, which was a yawn. Watch 'Nick Of Time' because it keeps you entertained in those 88 minutes.

    Are you kidding me? Thank goodness I'm watching this film in 2009 (post 9/11) and not 1995 when it came out because it's supposed to be a thriller and I'm laughing my bottom off like it's comedy. This film makes a mockery of Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken's talents as actors, it's a shocker to me that they even agreed to read the script let alone act in such fluff. Like most recent reviewers, I am catching up on Johnny Depp movies and I just have to say that this one in a clunker along an otherwise smooth road. Stupid Plot, stupid, stupid, stupid. The script should have been used to scoop up kitty litter rather than wasting money by making it into a film.

    Great cast with a bit of a far fetched quite annoying storyline. The beginning was very weak, picking some random person at an airport to kill the governor. If you can get past the fact that the governors husband and his team of security are so well organized to arrange the whole assassination and leave main key principle in the equation (the hit-man ) to a complete stranger who they know nothing about. Look past these points and sit back a watch then you can get through the movie and arrive at the end and think " that's not so bad " But on reflection it was. Clips with a shoe shine man with one false leg getting totally involved to help out and eventually getting shot, fortunately in his bad leg, which he then whacks one of the bad guys and knock her out with the false leg which she had just shot off. ( please !) Again this is my opinion. I read other reviews that people love this movie. Well ! we are not all the same.

    The cast, the crew (I guess), the props, the set, the acting were all fine, it was just the story that was sorely lacking. We all have to suspend our disbelief to a certain extent when watching a movie, but we shouldn't be asked to work quite so hard at it. Right from the git-go, to think that a professional "hit" squad would relinquish all control of their upcoming, VERY high profile job to a complete stranger, strains credulity to it's breaking point. That and one fortunate coincidence after another (like finding a capable, former soldier, who not only believes a very fantastic tale, but is willing and able to IMMEDIATELY arrange numerous details to save everyone's life)just constantly reminds you that this flimsy story couldn't possibly be really happening. So, nice try, but next time, strive for a teensy bit more believability, huh?

    Previously, when initially released in 1995 and in years following, I was a huge fan of Nick of Time. I had loved Johnny Depp's straight man performance, even though in 1995, he hadn't gone all crazy-role just yet. It's been probably well over a decade since I've last seen this movie and back in the 1990s, I had seen it multiple times. Today, it somewhat holds up. I still like Johnny in a non-looney role  ironically, I think he's trying too over-the-top for his past decade roles in order to be original, and yet, it might actually be original for him to return to this kind of character. I also appreciate Christopher Walken in pretty much anything, including this and always have liked Roma Maffia. I dig that chick. The movie cannot be taken seriously and you might enjoy it a little more. I don't think they were trying for anything too heavy and as a short and tight thriller with actual decent performances (not mentioned above, but still good, was shoe-shinning Charles S. Dutton,) it's entertaining. Pre-24 days, everyday man, Gene (Depp,) travels via train with his daughter when they're approached and coerced into assassinating the Governor at a nearby hotel and rally. Basically, and the plot is basic, two parties, Walken's Mr. Smith and Maffia's Mrs. Smith are watching Gene and his daughter, respectively and separately. Gene can't go to the police because bad man Mr. Smith's got eyes everywhere and his daughter is unaware she's in danger. Oh, and he's got 90 minutes to get close to and kill the Governor, or his daughter dies. Probably him, too. On the surface  or from a distance, the premise seems exciting and thrilling. And for the most part, the ingeniousness of Gene to handle something, including a gun, that he's never had to before, was pretty entertaining. But, once watched, it does show a little bit of B-movie qualities that reminds us again: don't take this seriously. Sure, I recommend it, but if I watched it for the first time today, I probably wouldn't have seen it the many times I did back in the 1990s.

    The clock is ticking for Johnny Depp in Nick of Time, a twist-filled, race-against-time thriller directed by John Badham. And indeed it is a race, filmed in "real time" so that on screen events unfold minute by nail-biting minute as they would in real life.Christopher Walken, Charles S. Dutton and Courtney Chase co-stars in this film. A stranger pulled into a deadly scheme races against time to save his daughter in this thriller. Gene Watson is an accountant who comes to L.A. with his ten-year-old daughter Lynn to attend a funeral. On the street, Gene and Lynn are pulled aside by Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones, who flash what look like police badges and usher them into a van. Gene soon discovers that he's been kidnapped, and his captors have an unusual demand that is if Gene does not murder Gov. Eleanor Grant within 75 minutes, his daughter will be killed. Gene now has just an hour and a quarter to tip off the authorities, spare Gov. Grant, and find out what Smith and Jones are trying to do, along with saving his daughter's life. He finds a much-needed ally in one-legged shoe-shine man Huey. This is a fast and furious 90 minutes that doesn't waste a second.Also,it is an exciting albeit illogical tale of mystery and suspense.Unfortunately,this is an average movie that was saved by the excellent performances of the cast particularly Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken. Aside from that,the plot is clich&eacute;d and predictable as well as it has been already seen in many movies before even with "real time" involved in the premise.

    Another "thriller" that offers little suspense. Depp tries to make this work. He can't. Walken barely walks through this, undoubtedly because he knew there was little point after seeing just how poor a job the screenwriter did on this movie. Gloria Reuben and the rest of the cast are wasted, as well. The premise would stretch credulity in the hands of a master director. Badham is NOT that (though he did a decent job with "Point of No Return" in 1993). Save your time and money. Watch the Bridget Fonda flick I just mentioned. Or try "No Way Out" or its predecessor "The Big Clock" if you want something old school. Just don't bother with this.

    Johnny Depp as your average Joe C.P.A.? Naw, say it isn't so. Isn't this the guy who rose to fame with strange robotic blades for fingers, with an eye-patch and catchy phrases, with a reputation for playing the strange and unusual? Well, the role may not be strange or unusual, but the movie certainly is. For one thing, it is extremely rare for a 90 minute movie to actually happen in 90 minutes. But Nick of Time is about the occurrences in Gene Watson's life over a span of 90 minutes. Christopher Walken shines as the SOB cop/assassin who manipulates Depp's character, and Roma Maffia excels as his partner. I think the most interesting aspect of this film is combining two powerful character actors (Depp and Walken) across from each other. The action is fast and non-stop, and the tension builds throughout the film. When Depp finally finds help in the form of Charles S. Dutton, a shoe shine man in the lobby of the Bonaventure, the help comes in the strangest way. Rated R for violence and language, this is a interesting, breakneck paced film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

    Johnny Depp has always been an extraordinary actor in all stages of his shining career and the rather unknown "Nick Of Time" is a great example to underline this thesis. The movie is a good thriller in real time as the series "24" for example and introduces many interesting and intriguing characters on both the good and the evil side. With every minute, the tension rises and you will watch this movie on the edge of your seat without any boring moments. The only weak point of the movie is that there aren't too many surprises in the end and that the ending is rather mainstream and predictable but the rest is truly great from the acting and the characters to the dialogues and the fighting and killing scenes. If you are a fan of Johnny Depp or short and sweet action thrillers, you should definitely check out this movie. It's nothing new or original but highly intensive and interesting even after several tries.

    I'd like to say that although the script was horrible at least Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken made the film worth a watch. We're talking about two fine American actors here. But, even if you've enjoyed every performance you've ever seen from Johnny Depp or Christopher Walken, take a pass on this movie. I've never seen a more uninspired performance from either of them. Ever. As for the script here's the deal - Some people who are politically connected want a certain governor dead. These are high powered people with serious money and inside connections with law enforcement. It would be very difficult to stop them. Well, unless of course their plan was "Let's grab some random stranger off a train, kidnap his daughter and blackmail him into killing the governor for us." Yea, that's gonna work. The Three Stooges in a Banana Republic might come up with a assassination scheme like this. It still wouldn't work, but at least it would be more fun to watch. I won't spoil it for you and tell you how things work out for Johnny Depp and his daughter but then again, do I really have to? And what's up with all the revolvers? I haven't seen this many revolvers in a film since the Dirty Harry films in the 1970's.
