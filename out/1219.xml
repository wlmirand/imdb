 <sinopse>
  When Max makes an preposterous promise to his girlfriend, his chances to fulfilling it seem hopeless when he is dragged onto a cross-country trip with his embarrassing father, Goofy.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  It's the last day of school, and Max wants to catch the eye of Roxanne, one of the more attractive girls in school. But how can you be cool when your dad's Goofy? Stage an impromptu concert at the final assembly, that's how! Or at least it sounded good until Principal Mazer found out. Goofy finds out about his son's antics (sort of), and decides a fishing trip, like his dad took him on, is the solution. Of course, he doesn't know that Max finally lands a date with Roxanne for a party thrown by the class valedictorian. Through the movie, Goofy tries to bring Max out of his shell, while Max resents being taken away, and lying to Roxanne about the trip (he tells her he & his dad will be appearing on TV at the PowerLine concert in LA). Will Max sink or swim? Will Goofy goof up his son's first shot at romance? Will Bigfoot step back? And what about those nuns?

    Having grown up watching it, it's one of my personal favorite kid movies of the 1990's. If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves. I have to admit, it was probably this movie that convinced me to come out of my shell and made the rest of my life more enjoyable and memorable. I have to say the humor works, physical slapstick, and jokes. Some of its jokes are pretty out there like odd breaking the fourth wall humor. I loved the Lester's possum park. I don't know if it was making fun of Disneyland or not, but it was funny. Always made me laugh. This always reminded me of Chuck E. Cheese. The big foot scene was hilarious as well. The supporting cast work even Pauley Shore as Max's friend, Bobby. I'm just glad, he had a small role. Good to see Jim Cummings voicing Pete. He is a voice actor legend. The animation was pretty OK, it wasn't catchy. It look like animation, you give a TV show, not a full length animation movie. The title also is kinda wrong. It's not a Goofy movie, but a movie about Max. Goofy only plays a supporting role in the film. Kinda like a second banana. I do have to say the movie have a musical like theme throughout the film. I love every song in the film. After Today is 'The Part of your world' emotional ballad for the Disney teenager male setting the table type song that mostly sang by Disney heroines. The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. "On the Open Road" and 'Nobody Else But You" are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out. The second uses a much more clich&eacute; theme of old vs. new, and though it does work and is interesting, never goes the extra mile to address anything of true importance. So I like this movie, better. Overall: There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me. It had an old concept, the buddy/father-son/coming-of-age adolescence film. But it did it in just a very fresh, very appealing way for me.

    A Goofy Movie is one of greatest and most memorable Disney movies of the 90's time period, which is saying something considering the 90's was their best decade in movies! And hands down, one of the best soundtracks by far! Max is the son of Goofy, and is getting ready to make a big splash on the last day of school by doing a live spoof of his favorite singers songs, Powerline. Powerline is a mix of Prince and Michael Jackson and sounds like MJ, even doing a bit of a moonwalk type of dance. Max gets into trouble for this and while in the principals office, runs into his long time crush, Roxanne. She invites him to a screening of Powerline's concert at her friends house over the summer and he has to turn her down because of an impromptu decision by Goofy to take Max on a cross country road trip in a desperate attempt to connect with him. Max lies to Roxanne and tells her that he is going to be at the concert, and starts his journey with his dad. The movie is full of classic Goofy moments, awesome lessons on father/son bonding, hijinks and adventures. The best songs on the soundtrack are I2I, Stand Out, After Today, and Nobody Else But You...all of which will have you singing along after the first time you hear it!

    What made me suddenly come and write a review to a movie that released over a decade and a half ago? The answer is simple. This movie is sincere and touching, exciting and hilarious, tear inducing and magical. I remember seeing this as a kid and have watched it every year almost after that. It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again over decades and it will still be fresh, entertaining and lovely. This movie is a definitive example of great, beautiful emotion that captures you and tugs at your heartstrings with its pure relatable and touching emotional storyline. SPOILERS AHEAD: A story about a father and son duo on a cross country trip with different plans and a story of parent-child bonding and seeing each others perspectives. A story that had me in tears with its honesty and masterful as well as emotional storytelling. It has intelligent wit and humor as well as catchy song that i still find myself humming 17 years later. These days many animated films rely on the quality of animation but have a shallow story. This one, a great classic gem from the past, has lovely animation and a smart, intelligent and heart filled story that just warms your heart and has you in smiles and tears through out. An accurate depiction of father-son relationships and teenagers. One of those larger than life films i will see with my kids. They don't make fantastic, animated adventure films this great anymore. Very few live up to it. Saw it on TV and was reminded of its heart warming, action packed adventure filled with some of the greatest humor Disney films have ever incorporated. A fun magical ride for all generations and a classic whose status as one of the best will be cemented int he years to come. SOME of the greatest films of all time are underrated and this gem is one of them. A testament to when animated films had that something special, something very few animated films can regenerate these days.

    I haven't seen anything from Disney forever, so watching this movie I had to make some choices earlier on with judging characters. Goofy is, well goofy! Max is a teenager. He likes a girl. It all works since it's basically a cartoon version of a dramatic high school story. With father and son troubles and other adventures. I find it amusing how goofy just never seemed to notice that his son wasn't happy, and when he did he misunderstood the sadness and tried to interpret it to his views. By the end of the movie, things are cleared between them and things seem well, even if it IS still goofy. I was pretty much fine with the movie as a while, since I haven't seen every show in the past and don't remember much, it's hard to honestly judge. But I say 8/10 to be fair.

    When I picked this movie all I could think of all the great memories that came along with it. Starting off with the great music that was in it. The catchy lyrics from "After Today" and "I2I". I also still loved how maturity that could be found in this most simple parts. An example being with how Goofy reacts to finding out that Max, his son, lied to him. I love the way the worked in some light fourth wall jokes like having Donald Duck and Mickey join in on the song," All in All" while being lost in the middle of the highway to The little Mermaid light switch. I also enjoyed how the growth of relationship between Max and Goofy. Overall I loved this movie and hope it becomes a real Disney Classic. I also enjoyed the music video with Lou Bega doing the cleaned up verison of Mambo No. 5. In short,a great movie and wonderful DVD release to boot!

    I never though that this movie would be any good, until I saw it on Cinema when I was little. I didn't remember this movie to be that good until I re-watched it as an adult. This movie capture the relation between father and son perfectly. On one side you have a typical child having a crush on a girl as he tries to act cool and draws her attention in every opportunity, and on the other side is the most uncool father a child would ever wish to have that could ruin his reputation in an instant. Max values "coolness" greatly and tries to sever any relation he has with his goofy bloodline (even though his bloodline is occasionally catching up to him in the form of embarrassing Goofyish trademark subconscious laughs). Goofy on the other hand is the caring father, that is oblivious of the worlds recent trends, have no idea what being cool is or how his action can damage his son's reputation, and believe that every experience he had at his younger years, will work just as well on his son. Thus begin an journey where Goofy will learn to respect his son and realize that not two people are the same, and Max will have to accept and learn to appreciate his father for what he is. Also worth to note is that there is no main villain in this movie. Disney's traditional antagonist Black Pit plays an important role, but he never does anything bad, he does't sabotage the heroes's goal in any way, he don't wish bad for them, he does't get punished in the end, he even tries to help the occasionally with advices that he thinks are good. His role in the story is to represent a different opinion of how a father should interact with his son, and even though he is presented as the bad example, there is no solid proof that his model is entirely wrong. This movie could had worked as well with any random cast of characters, but for some reason Disney threw goofy in those shoes, and that was both good and bad. On the good side, Goofy's recognizably goofy and slapstick personality fits perfectly the uncool father, without making him annoying to the viewer. On the bad side, most people thought of this movie as a long Goofy cartoon and it didn't get the recognition it deserves. The movie designed to entertain and teach equally to both the child and the parrent. You should give it a shot.

    In spite of having been a faithful Goof Troop regular watcher when it aired, I hadn't watched A Goofy Movie until yesterday, 16 years since it was in theatres. And I have to say, I have no regrets! The movie was far more deeper than I imagined. I expected a lighthearted movie with plenty of laughs, and I got that, and more, and I was impressed by how well they fleshed out the characters. I would definitely consider A Goofy Movie an underrated Disney movie, in my eyes. Whether or not you're looking for the nostaliga rush that I got when I saw it or just looking for a good family movie to watch with your family, I highly recommend A Goofy Movie!

    Disney's A Goofy Movie may not be one of their best films but it still holds up to this day in my opinion. A funny movie about Goofy and his son. Poor Max is not very popular at school and he has a crush on a girl named Roxanne. He wants to be popular with his fellow students and Roxanne so he decides to dress up like his favorite singer Powerline and put on a show for the last day of school. He of course succeeds and everyone takes an immediate liking to him. (If life were really that simple) Max gets invited to a Powerline concert that will air on television by Roxanne but he has to cut it short when Goofy plans on taking him on vacation after his Principal insists that he is in big trouble for causing an uproar at the school. Goofy thinks that by taking his son on vacation and bonding with him he won't end up going down the wrong path. Unfortunately Max has to break his plans with Roxanne but before he leaves he lies to her about his dad knowing Powerline and that they are going to meet up with him. Max and Goofy head out and they get into a few adventures that make Max realize that his dad only wanted what was best for him. As for the rest I won't spoil it but it makes for a tearful happy ending. While A Goofy Movie isn't considered a masterpiece classic it is still worth watching and an overall enjoyable experience.

    The tag-line couldn't be more appropriate! It IS hard to be cool when your dad is Goofy! Lucky he's not my father or yours, eh? Poor young Max! Goofy's cool dude 14-year-old son Max will go as far as taking it upon himself to ruin a school assembly by the principal to impress his bashful girlfriend Roxanne (Principal Mazor is the principal's name - WHY???!!! Something a little more fictitious would've been better I'd say). Even when he's in big trouble with Mazor he can only think of the fact that he's failed to impress Roxanne - he thinks! She loved his dance on the stage and would love to go on a date with him!... Not if Goofy's got anything to do with it! He is completely obsessed with his son 'Maxie' as he always patronizingly calls him and whisks him away from home to go on a holiday, against Max's will! Goofy doesn't give a toss about Max and his love-life and now Max is very much likely to lose Roxanne! To the end, Goofy is totally selfish and even reduces to taking enjoyment in cruelly humiliating Max at the most worn-down theme park I've ever seen! Luckily enough, the opportunity to break free of Goofy's clutches occurs when he goes to sleep in the car and Max has the map right in front of him! Max quietly makes alterations to the map taking them both to Los Angeles where Max intends to join a famous pop-star to make for a good enough excuse for missing his date with Roxanne. What else was the poor lad supposed to do?! I'd have done the same! So when Goofy finds out about Max's plan by looking at the map himself, he is in no position whatsoever of feeling angry with his son!... GOOFY: You lied to me! MAX: I had to - you were ruining my life! Why should anybody have their lives being ruined?! Anyway it all ends happily because Max both builds a bond with Goofy and finally wins his girlfriend over!

A testament to when animated films had that something special, something very few animated films can regenerate these days.

    I haven't seen anything from Disney forever, so watching this movie I had to make some choices earlier on with judging characters. Goofy is, well goofy! Max is a teenager. He likes a girl. It all works since it's basically a cartoon version of a dramatic high school story. With father and son troubles and other adventures. I find it amusing how goofy just never seemed to notice that his son wasn't happy, and when he did he misunderstood the sadness and tried to interpret it to his views. By the end of the movie, things are cleared between them and things seem well, even if it IS still goofy. I was pretty much fine with the movie as a while, since I haven't seen every show in the past and don't remember much, it's hard to honestly judge. But I say 8/10 to be fair.

    When I picked this movie all I could think of all the great memories that came along with it. Starting off with the great music that was in it. The catchy lyrics from "After Today" and "I2I". I also still loved how maturity that could be found in this most simple parts. An example being with how Goofy reacts to finding out that Max, his son, lied to him. I love the way the worked in some light fourth wall jokes like having Donald Duck and Mickey join in on the song," All in All" while being lost in the middle of the highway to The little Mermaid light switch. I also enjoyed how the growth of relationship between Max and Goofy. Overall I loved this movie and hope it becomes a real Disney Classic. I also enjoyed the music video with Lou Bega doing the cleaned up verison of Mambo No. 5. In short,a great movie and wonderful DVD release to boot!

    I never though that this movie would be any good, until I saw it on Cinema when I was little. I didn't remember this movie to be that good until I re-watched it as an adult. This movie capture the relation between father and son perfectly. On one side you have a typical child having a crush on a girl as he tries to act cool and draws her attention in every opportunity, and on the other side is the most uncool father a child would ever wish to have that could ruin his reputation in an instant. Max values "coolness" greatly and tries to sever any relation he has with his goofy bloodline (even though his bloodline is occasionally catching up to him in the form of embarrassing Goofyish trademark subconscious laughs). Goofy on the other hand is the caring father, that is oblivious of the worlds recent trends, have no idea what being cool is or how his action can damage his son's reputation, and believe that every experience he had at his younger years, will work just as well on his son. Thus begin an journey where Goofy will learn to respect his son and realize that not two people are the same, and Max will have to accept and learn to appreciate his father for what he is. Also worth to note is that there is no main villain in this movie. Disney's traditional antagonist Black Pit plays an important role, but he never does anything bad, he does't sabotage the heroes's goal in any way, he don't wish bad for them, he does't get punished in the end, he even tries to help the occasionally with advices that he thinks are good. His role in the story is to represent a different opinion of how a father should interact with his son, and even though he is presented as the bad example, there is no solid proof that his model is entirely wrong. This movie could had worked as well with any random cast of characters, but for some reason Disney threw goofy in those shoes, and that was both good and bad. On the good side, Goofy's recognizably goofy and slapstick personality fits perfectly the uncool father, without making him annoying to the viewer. On the bad side, most people thought of this movie as a long Goofy cartoon and it didn't get the recognition it deserves. The movie designed to entertain and teach equally to both the child and the parrent. You should give it a shot.

    In spite of having been a faithful Goof Troop regular watcher when it aired, I hadn't watched A Goofy Movie until yesterday, 16 years since it was in theatres. And I have to say, I have no regrets! The movie was far more deeper than I imagined. I expected a lighthearted movie with plenty of laughs, and I got that, and more, and I was impressed by how well they fleshed out the characters. I would definitely consider A Goofy Movie an underrated Disney movie, in my eyes. Whether or not you're looking for the nostaliga rush that I got when I saw it or just looking for a good family movie to watch with your family, I highly recommend A Goofy Movie!

    Disney's A Goofy Movie may not be one of their best films but it still holds up to this day in my opinion. A funny movie about Goofy and his son. Poor Max is not very popular at school and he has a crush on a girl named Roxanne. He wants to be popular with his fellow students and Roxanne so he decides to dress up like his favorite singer Powerline and put on a show for the last day of school. He of course succeeds and everyone takes an immediate liking to him. (If life were really that simple) Max gets invited to a Powerline concert that will air on television by Roxanne but he has to cut it short when Goofy plans on taking him on vacation after his Principal insists that he is in big trouble for causing an uproar at the school. Goofy thinks that by taking his son on vacation and bonding with him he won't end up going down the wrong path. Unfortunately Max has to break his plans with Roxanne but before he leaves he lies to her about his dad knowing Powerline and that they are going to meet up with him. Max and Goofy head out and they get into a few adventures that make Max realize that his dad only wanted what was best for him. As for the rest I won't spoil it but it makes for a tearful happy ending. While A Goofy Movie isn't considered a masterpiece classic it is still worth watching and an overall enjoyable experience.

    The tag-line couldn't be more appropriate! It IS hard to be cool when your dad is Goofy! Lucky he's not my father or yours, eh? Poor young Max! Goofy's cool dude 14-year-old son Max will go as far as taking it upon himself to ruin a school assembly by the principal to impress his bashful girlfriend Roxanne (Principal Mazor is the principal's name - WHY???!!! Something a little more fictitious would've been better I'd say). Even when he's in big trouble with Mazor he can only think of the fact that he's failed to impress Roxanne - he thinks! She loved his dance on the stage and would love to go on a date with him!... Not if Goofy's got anything to do with it! He is completely obsessed with his son 'Maxie' as he always patronizingly calls him and whisks him away from home to go on a holiday, against Max's will! Goofy doesn't give a toss about Max and his love-life and now Max is very much likely to lose Roxanne! To the end, Goofy is totally selfish and even reduces to taking enjoyment in cruelly humiliating Max at the most worn-down theme park I've ever seen! Luckily enough, the opportunity to break free of Goofy's clutches occurs when he goes to sleep in the car and Max has the map right in front of him! Max quietly makes alterations to the map taking them both to Los Angeles where Max intends to join a famous pop-star to make for a good enough excuse for missing his date with Roxanne. What else was the poor lad supposed to do?! I'd have done the same! So when Goofy finds out about Max's plan by looking at the map himself, he is in no position whatsoever of feeling angry with his son!... GOOFY: You lied to me! MAX: I had to - you were ruining my life! Why should anybody have their lives being ruined?! Anyway it all ends happily because Max both builds a bond with Goofy and finally wins his girlfriend over!

    Having grown up watching it, it's one of my personal favorite kid movies of the 1990's. If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves. I have to admit, it was probably this movie that convinced me to come out of my shell and made the rest of my life more enjoyable and memorable. I have to say the humor works, physical slapstick, and jokes. Some of its jokes are pretty out there like odd breaking the fourth wall humor. I loved the Lester's possum park. I don't know if it was making fun of Disneyland or not, but it was funny. Always made me laugh. This always reminded me of Chuck E. Cheese. The big foot scene was hilarious as well. The supporting cast work even Pauley Shore as Max's friend, Bobby. I'm just glad, he had a small role. Good to see Jim Cummings voicing Pete. He is a voice actor legend. The animation was pretty OK, it wasn't catchy. It look like animation, you give a TV show, not a full length animation movie. The title also is kinda wrong. It's not a Goofy movie, but a movie about Max. Goofy only plays a supporting role in the film. Kinda like a second banana. I do have to say the movie have a musical like theme throughout the film. I love every song in the film. After Today is 'The Part of your world' emotional ballad for the Disney teenager male setting the table type song that mostly sang by Disney heroines. The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. "On the Open Road" and 'Nobody Else But You" are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out. The second uses a much more clich&eacute; theme of old vs. new, and though it does work and is interesting, never goes the extra mile to address anything of true importance. So I like this movie, better. Overall: There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me. It had an old concept, the buddy/father-son/coming-of-age adolescence film. But it did it in just a very fresh, very appealing way for me.

    A Goofy Movie is one of greatest and most memorable Disney movies of the 90's time period, which is saying something considering the 90's was their best decade in movies! And hands down, one of the best soundtracks by far! Max is the son of Goofy, and is getting ready to make a big splash on the last day of school by doing a live spoof of his favorite singers songs, Powerline. Powerline is a mix of Prince and Michael Jackson and sounds like MJ, even doing a bit of a moonwalk type of dance. Max gets into trouble for this and while in the principals office, runs into his long time crush, Roxanne. She invites him to a screening of Powerline's concert at her friends house over the summer and he has to turn her down because of an impromptu decision by Goofy to take Max on a cross country road trip in a desperate attempt to connect with him. Max lies to Roxanne and tells her that he is going to be at the concert, and starts his journey with his dad. The movie is full of classic Goofy moments, awesome lessons on father/son bonding, hijinks and adventures. The best songs on the soundtrack are I2I, Stand Out, After Today, and Nobody Else But You...all of which will have you singing along after the first time you hear it!

    What made me suddenly come and write a review to a movie that released over a decade and a half ago? The answer is simple. This movie is sincere and touching, exciting and hilarious, tear inducing and magical. I remember seeing this as a kid and have watched it every year almost after that. It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again over decades and it will still be fresh, entertaining and lovely. This movie is a definitive example of great, beautiful emotion that captures you and tugs at your heartstrings with its pure relatable and touching emotional storyline. SPOILERS AHEAD: A story about a father and son duo on a cross country trip with different plans and a story of parent-child bonding and seeing each others perspectives. A story that had me in tears with its honesty and masterful as well as emotional storytelling. It has intelligent wit and humor as well as catchy song that i still find myself humming 17 years later. These days many animated films rely on the quality of animation but have a shallow story. This one, a great classic gem from the past, has lovely animation and a smart, intelligent and heart filled story that just warms your heart and has you in smiles and tears through out. An accurate depiction of father-son relationships and teenagers. One of those larger than life films i will see with my kids. They don't make fantastic, animated adventure films this great anymore. Very few live up to it. Saw it on TV and was reminded of its heart warming, action packed adventure filled with some of the greatest humor Disney films have ever incorporated. A fun magical ride for all generations and a classic whose status as one of the best will be cemented int he years to come. SOME of the greatest films of all time are underrated and this gem is one of them. A testament to when animated films had that something special, something very few animated films can regenerate these days.

    Having grown up watching it, it's one of my personal favorite kid movies of the 1990's. If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves. I have to admit, it was probably this movie that convinced me to come out of my shell and made the rest of my life more enjoyable and memorable. I have to say the humor works, physical slapstick, and jokes. Some of its jokes are pretty out there like odd breaking the fourth wall humor. I loved the Lester's possum park. I don't know if it was making fun of Disneyland or not, but it was funny. Always made me laugh. This always reminded me of Chuck E. Cheese. The big foot scene was hilarious as well. The supporting cast work even Pauley Shore as Max's friend, Bobby. I'm just glad, he had a small role. Good to see Jim Cummings voicing Pete. He is a voice actor legend. The animation was pretty OK, it wasn't catchy. It look like animation, you give a TV show, not a full length animation movie. The title also is kinda wrong. It's not a Goofy movie, but a movie about Max. Goofy only plays a supporting role in the film. Kinda like a second banana. I do have to say the movie have a musical like theme throughout the film. I love every song in the film. After Today is 'The Part of your world' emotional ballad for the Disney teenager male setting the table type song that mostly sang by Disney heroines. The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. "On the Open Road" and 'Nobody Else But You" are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out. The second uses a much more clich&eacute; theme of old vs. new, and though it does work and is interesting, never goes the extra mile to address anything of true importance. So I like this movie, better. Overall: There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me. It had an old concept, the buddy/father-son/coming-of-age adolescence film. But it did it in just a very fresh, very appealing way for me.

    A Goofy Movie is one of greatest and most memorable Disney movies of the 90's time period, which is saying something considering the 90's was their best decade in movies! And hands down, one of the best soundtracks by far! Max is the son of Goofy, and is getting ready to make a big splash on the last day of school by doing a live spoof of his favorite singers songs, Powerline. Powerline is a mix of Prince and Michael Jackson and sounds like MJ, even doing a bit of a moonwalk type of dance. Max gets into trouble for this and while in the principals office, runs into his long time crush, Roxanne. She invites him to a screening of Powerline's concert at her friends house over the summer and he has to turn her down because of an impromptu decision by Goofy to take Max on a cross country road trip in a desperate attempt to connect with him. Max lies to Roxanne and tells her that he is going to be at the concert, and starts his journey with his dad. The movie is full of classic Goofy moments, awesome lessons on father/son bonding, hijinks and adventures. The best songs on the soundtrack are I2I, Stand Out, After Today, and Nobody Else But You...all of which will have you singing along after the first time you hear it!

    What made me suddenly come and write a review to a movie that released over a decade and a half ago? The answer is simple. This movie is sincere and touching, exciting and hilarious, tear inducing and magical. I remember seeing this as a kid and have watched it every year almost after that. It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again over decades and it will still be fresh, entertaining and lovely. This movie is a definitive example of great, beautiful emotion that captures you and tugs at your heartstrings with its pure relatable and touching emotional storyline. SPOILERS AHEAD: A story about a father and son duo on a cross country trip with different plans and a story of parent-child bonding and seeing each others perspectives. A story that had me in tears with its honesty and masterful as well as emotional storytelling. It has intelligent wit and humor as well as catchy song that i still find myself humming 17 years later. These days many animated films rely on the quality of animation but have a shallow story. This one, a great classic gem from the past, has lovely animation and a smart, intelligent and heart filled story that just warms your heart and has you in smiles and tears through out. An accurate depiction of father-son relationships and teenagers. One of those larger than life films i will see with my kids. They don't make fantastic, animated adventure films this great anymore. Very few live up to it. Saw it on TV and was reminded of its heart warming, action packed adventure filled with some of the greatest humor Disney films have ever incorporated. A fun magical ride for all generations and a classic whose status as one of the best will be cemented int he years to come. SOME of the greatest films of all time are underrated and this gem is one of them. A testament to when animated films had that something special, something very few animated films can regenerate these days.

    I haven't seen anything from Disney forever, so watching this movie I had to make some choices earlier on with judging characters. Goofy is, well goofy! Max is a teenager. He likes a girl. It all works since it's basically a cartoon version of a dramatic high school story. With father and son troubles and other adventures. I find it amusing how goofy just never seemed to notice that his son wasn't happy, and when he did he misunderstood the sadness and tried to interpret it to his views. By the end of the movie, things are cleared between them and things seem well, even if it IS still goofy. I was pretty much fine with the movie as a while, since I haven't seen every show in the past and don't remember much, it's hard to honestly judge. But I say 8/10 to be fair.

    When I picked this movie all I could think of all the great memories that came along with it. Starting off with the great music that was in it. The catchy lyrics from "After Today" and "I2I". I also still loved how maturity that could be found in this most simple parts. An example being with how Goofy reacts to finding out that Max, his son, lied to him. I love the way the worked in some light fourth wall jokes like having Donald Duck and Mickey join in on the song," All in All" while being lost in the middle of the highway to The little Mermaid light switch. I also enjoyed how the growth of relationship between Max and Goofy. Overall I loved this movie and hope it becomes a real Disney Classic. I also enjoyed the music video with Lou Bega doing the cleaned up verison of Mambo No. 5. In short,a great movie and wonderful DVD release to boot!

    I never though that this movie would be any good, until I saw it on Cinema when I was little. I didn't remember this movie to be that good until I re-watched it as an adult. This movie capture the relation between father and son perfectly. On one side you have a typical child having a crush on a girl as he tries to act cool and draws her attention in every opportunity, and on the other side is the most uncool father a child would ever wish to have that could ruin his reputation in an instant. Max values "coolness" greatly and tries to sever any relation he has with his goofy bloodline (even though his bloodline is occasionally catching up to him in the form of embarrassing Goofyish trademark subconscious laughs). Goofy on the other hand is the caring father, that is oblivious of the worlds recent trends, have no idea what being cool is or how his action can damage his son's reputation, and believe that every experience he had at his younger years, will work just as well on his son. Thus begin an journey where Goofy will learn to respect his son and realize that not two people are the same, and Max will have to accept and learn to appreciate his father for what he is. Also worth to note is that there is no main villain in this movie. Disney's traditional antagonist Black Pit plays an important role, but he never does anything bad, he does't sabotage the heroes's goal in any way, he don't wish bad for them, he does't get punished in the end, he even tries to help the occasionally with advices that he thinks are good. His role in the story is to represent a different opinion of how a father should interact with his son, and even though he is presented as the bad example, there is no solid proof that his model is entirely wrong. This movie could had worked as well with any random cast of characters, but for some reason Disney threw goofy in those shoes, and that was both good and bad. On the good side, Goofy's recognizably goofy and slapstick personality fits perfectly the uncool father, without making him annoying to the viewer. On the bad side, most people thought of this movie as a long Goofy cartoon and it didn't get the recognition it deserves. The movie designed to entertain and teach equally to both the child and the parrent. You should give it a shot.

    In spite of having been a faithful Goof Troop regular watcher when it aired, I hadn't watched A Goofy Movie until yesterday, 16 years since it was in theatres. And I have to say, I have no regrets! The movie was far more deeper than I imagined. I expected a lighthearted movie with plenty of laughs, and I got that, and more, and I was impressed by how well they fleshed out the characters. I would definitely consider A Goofy Movie an underrated Disney movie, in my eyes. Whether or not you're looking for the nostaliga rush that I got when I saw it or just looking for a good family movie to watch with your family, I highly recommend A Goofy Movie!

    Disney's A Goofy Movie may not be one of their best films but it still holds up to this day in my opinion. A funny movie about Goofy and his son. Poor Max is not very popular at school and he has a crush on a girl named Roxanne. He wants to be popular with his fellow students and Roxanne so he decides to dress up like his favorite singer Powerline and put on a show for the last day of school. He of course succeeds and everyone takes an immediate liking to him. (If life were really that simple) Max gets invited to a Powerline concert that will air on television by Roxanne but he has to cut it short when Goofy plans on taking him on vacation after his Principal insists that he is in big trouble for causing an uproar at the school. Goofy thinks that by taking his son on vacation and bonding with him he won't end up going down the wrong path. Unfortunately Max has to break his plans with Roxanne but before he leaves he lies to her about his dad knowing Powerline and that they are going to meet up with him. Max and Goofy head out and they get into a few adventures that make Max realize that his dad only wanted what was best for him. As for the rest I won't spoil it but it makes for a tearful happy ending. While A Goofy Movie isn't considered a masterpiece classic it is still worth watching and an overall enjoyable experience.

    The tag-line couldn't be more appropriate! It IS hard to be cool when your dad is Goofy! Lucky he's not my father or yours, eh? Poor young Max! Goofy's cool dude 14-year-old son Max will go as far as taking it upon himself to ruin a school assembly by the principal to impress his bashful girlfriend Roxanne (Principal Mazor is the principal's name - WHY???!!! Something a little more fictitious would've been better I'd say). Even when he's in big trouble with Mazor he can only think of the fact that he's failed to impress Roxanne - he thinks! She loved his dance on the stage and would love to go on a date with him!... Not if Goofy's got anything to do with it! He is completely obsessed with his son 'Maxie' as he always patronizingly calls him and whisks him away from home to go on a holiday, against Max's will! Goofy doesn't give a toss about Max and his love-life and now Max is very much likely to lose Roxanne! To the end, Goofy is totally selfish and even reduces to taking enjoyment in cruelly humiliating Max at the most worn-down theme park I've ever seen! Luckily enough, the opportunity to break free of Goofy's clutches occurs when he goes to sleep in the car and Max has the map right in front of him! Max quietly makes alterations to the map taking them both to Los Angeles where Max intends to join a famous pop-star to make for a good enough excuse for missing his date with Roxanne. What else was the poor lad supposed to do?! I'd have done the same! So when Goofy finds out about Max's plan by looking at the map himself, he is in no position whatsoever of feeling angry with his son!... GOOFY: You lied to me! MAX: I had to - you were ruining my life! Why should anybody have their lives being ruined?! Anyway it all ends happily because Max both builds a bond with Goofy and finally wins his girlfriend over!

    I never though that this movie would be any good, until I saw it on Cinema when I was little. I didn't remember this movie to be that good until I re-watched it as an adult. This movie capture the relation between father and son perfectly. On one side you have a typical child having a crush on a girl as he tries to act cool and draws her attention in every opportunity, and on the other side is the most uncool father a child would ever wish to have that could ruin his reputation in an instant. Max values "coolness" greatly and tries to sever any relation he has with his goofy bloodline (even though his bloodline is occasionally catching up to him in the form of embarrassing Goofyish trademark subconscious laughs). Goofy on the other hand is the caring father, that is oblivious of the worlds recent trends, have no idea what being cool is or how his action can damage his son's reputation, and believe that every experience he had at his younger years, will work just as well on his son. Thus begin an journey where Goofy will learn to respect his son and realize that not two people are the same, and Max will have to accept and learn to appreciate his father for what he is. Also worth to note is that there is no main villain in this movie. Disney's traditional antagonist Black Pit plays an important role, but he never does anything bad, he does't sabotage the heroes's goal in any way, he don't wish bad for them, he does't get punished in the end, he even tries to help the occasionally with advices that he thinks are good. His role in the story is to represent a different opinion of how a father should interact with his son, and even though he is presented as the bad example, there is no solid proof that his model is entirely wrong. This movie could had worked as well with any random cast of characters, but for some reason Disney threw goofy in those shoes, and that was both good and bad. On the good side, Goofy's recognizably goofy and slapstick personality fits perfectly the uncool father, without making him annoying to the viewer. On the bad side, most people thought of this movie as a long Goofy cartoon and it didn't get the recognition it deserves. The movie designed to entertain and teach equally to both the child and the parrent. You should give it a shot.

    In spite of having been a faithful Goof Troop regular watcher when it aired, I hadn't watched A Goofy Movie until yesterday, 16 years since it was in theatres. And I have to say, I have no regrets! The movie was far more deeper than I imagined. I expected a lighthearted movie with plenty of laughs, and I got that, and more, and I was impressed by how well they fleshed out the characters. I would definitely consider A Goofy Movie an underrated Disney movie, in my eyes. Whether or not you're looking for the nostaliga rush that I got when I saw it or just looking for a good family movie to watch with your family, I highly recommend A Goofy Movie!

    Disney's A Goofy Movie may not be one of their best films but it still holds up to this day in my opinion. A funny movie about Goofy and his son. Poor Max is not very popular at school and he has a crush on a girl named Roxanne. He wants to be popular with his fellow students and Roxanne so he decides to dress up like his favorite singer Powerline and put on a show for the last day of school. He of course succeeds and everyone takes an immediate liking to him. (If life were really that simple) Max gets invited to a Powerline concert that will air on television by Roxanne but he has to cut it short when Goofy plans on taking him on vacation after his Principal insists that he is in big trouble for causing an uproar at the school. Goofy thinks that by taking his son on vacation and bonding with him he won't end up going down the wrong path. Unfortunately Max has to break his plans with Roxanne but before he leaves he lies to her about his dad knowing Powerline and that they are going to meet up with him. Max and Goofy head out and they get into a few adventures that make Max realize that his dad only wanted what was best for him. As for the rest I won't spoil it but it makes for a tearful happy ending. While A Goofy Movie isn't considered a masterpiece classic it is still worth watching and an overall enjoyable experience.

    The tag-line couldn't be more appropriate! It IS hard to be cool when your dad is Goofy! Lucky he's not my father or yours, eh? Poor young Max! Goofy's cool dude 14-year-old son Max will go as far as taking it upon himself to ruin a school assembly by the principal to impress his bashful girlfriend Roxanne (Principal Mazor is the principal's name - WHY???!!! Something a little more fictitious would've been better I'd say). Even when he's in big trouble with Mazor he can only think of the fact that he's failed to impress Roxanne - he thinks! She loved his dance on the stage and would love to go on a date with him!... Not if Goofy's got anything to do with it! He is completely obsessed with his son 'Maxie' as he always patronizingly calls him and whisks him away from home to go on a holiday, against Max's will! Goofy doesn't give a toss about Max and his love-life and now Max is very much likely to lose Roxanne! To the end, Goofy is totally selfish and even reduces to taking enjoyment in cruelly humiliating Max at the most worn-down theme park I've ever seen! Luckily enough, the opportunity to break free of Goofy's clutches occurs when he goes to sleep in the car and Max has the map right in front of him! Max quietly makes alterations to the map taking them both to Los Angeles where Max intends to join a famous pop-star to make for a good enough excuse for missing his date with Roxanne. What else was the poor lad supposed to do?! I'd have done the same! So when Goofy finds out about Max's plan by looking at the map himself, he is in no position whatsoever of feeling angry with his son!... GOOFY: You lied to me! MAX: I had to - you were ruining my life! Why should anybody have their lives being ruined?! Anyway it all ends happily because Max both builds a bond with Goofy and finally wins his girlfriend over!

    Having grown up watching it, it's one of my personal favorite kid movies of the 1990's. If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves. I have to admit, it was probably this movie that convinced me to come out of my shell and made the rest of my life more enjoyable and memorable. I have to say the humor works, physical slapstick, and jokes. Some of its jokes are pretty out there like odd breaking the fourth wall humor. I loved the Lester's possum park. I don't know if it was making fun of Disneyland or not, but it was funny. Always made me laugh. This always reminded me of Chuck E. Cheese. The big foot scene was hilarious as well. The supporting cast work even Pauley Shore as Max's friend, Bobby. I'm just glad, he had a small role. Good to see Jim Cummings voicing Pete. He is a voice actor legend. The animation was pretty OK, it wasn't catchy. It look like animation, you give a TV show, not a full length animation movie. The title also is kinda wrong. It's not a Goofy movie, but a movie about Max. Goofy only plays a supporting role in the film. Kinda like a second banana. I do have to say the movie have a musical like theme throughout the film. I love every song in the film. After Today is 'The Part of your world' emotional ballad for the Disney teenager male setting the table type song that mostly sang by Disney heroines. The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. "On the Open Road" and 'Nobody Else But You" are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out. The second uses a much more clich&eacute; theme of old vs. new, and though it does work and is interesting, never goes the extra mile to address anything of true importance. So I like this movie, better. Overall: There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me. It had an old concept, the buddy/father-son/coming-of-age adolescence film. But it did it in just a very fresh, very appealing way for me.

    A Goofy Movie is one of greatest and most memorable Disney movies of the 90's time period, which is saying something considering the 90's was their best decade in movies! And hands down, one of the best soundtracks by far! Max is the son of Goofy, and is getting ready to make a big splash on the last day of school by doing a live spoof of his favorite singers songs, Powerline. Powerline is a mix of Prince and Michael Jackson and sounds like MJ, even doing a bit of a moonwalk type of dance. Max gets into trouble for this and while in the principals office, runs into his long time crush, Roxanne. She invites him to a screening of Powerline's concert at her friends house over the summer and he has to turn her down because of an impromptu decision by Goofy to take Max on a cross country road trip in a desperate attempt to connect with him. Max lies to Roxanne and tells her that he is going to be at the concert, and starts his journey with his dad. The movie is full of classic Goofy moments, awesome lessons on father/son bonding, hijinks and adventures. The best songs on the soundtrack are I2I, Stand Out, After Today, and Nobody Else But You...all of which will have you singing along after the first time you hear it!

    What made me suddenly come and write a review to a movie that released over a decade and a half ago? The answer is simple. This movie is sincere and touching, exciting and hilarious, tear inducing and magical. I remember seeing this as a kid and have watched it every year almost after that. It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again over decades and it will still be fresh, entertaining and lovely. This movie is a definitive example of great, beautiful emotion that captures you and tugs at your heartstrings with its pure relatable and touching emotional storyline. SPOILERS AHEAD: A story about a father and son duo on a cross country trip with different plans and a story of parent-child bonding and seeing each others perspectives. A story that had me in tears with its honesty and masterful as well as emotional storytelling. It has intelligent wit and humor as well as catchy song that i still find myself humming 17 years later. These days many animated films rely on the quality of animation but have a shallow story. This one, a great classic gem from the past, has lovely animation and a smart, intelligent and heart filled story that just warms your heart and has you in smiles and tears through out. An accurate depiction of father-son relationships and teenagers. One of those larger than life films i will see with my kids. They don't make fantastic, animated adventure films this great anymore. Very few live up to it. Saw it on TV and was reminded of its heart warming, action packed adventure filled with some of the greatest humor Disney films have ever incorporated. A fun magical ride for all generations and a classic whose status as one of the best will be cemented int he years to come. SOME of the greatest films of all time are underrated and this gem is one of them. A testament to when animated films had that something special, something very few animated films can regenerate these days.

    I haven't seen anything from Disney forever, so watching this movie I had to make some choices earlier on with judging characters. Goofy is, well goofy! Max is a teenager. He likes a girl. It all works since it's basically a cartoon version of a dramatic high school story. With father and son troubles and other adventures. I find it amusing how goofy just never seemed to notice that his son wasn't happy, and when he did he misunderstood the sadness and tried to interpret it to his views. By the end of the movie, things are cleared between them and things seem well, even if it IS still goofy. I was pretty much fine with the movie as a while, since I haven't seen every show in the past and don't remember much, it's hard to honestly judge. But I say 8/10 to be fair.

    When I picked this movie all I could think of all the great memories that came along with it. Starting off with the great music that was in it. The catchy lyrics from "After Today" and "I2I". I also still loved how maturity that could be found in this most simple parts. An example being with how Goofy reacts to finding out that Max, his son, lied to him. I love the way the worked in some light fourth wall jokes like having Donald Duck and Mickey join in on the song," All in All" while being lost in the middle of the highway to The little Mermaid light switch. I also enjoyed how the growth of relationship between Max and Goofy. Overall I loved this movie and hope it becomes a real Disney Classic. I also enjoyed the music video with Lou Bega doing the cleaned up verison of Mambo No. 5. In short,a great movie and wonderful DVD release to boot!

I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves. I have to admit, it was probably this movie that convinced me to come out of my shell and made the rest of my life more enjoyable and memorable. I have to say the humor works, physical slapstick, and jokes. Some of its jokes are pretty out there like odd breaking the fourth wall humor. I loved the Lester's possum park. I don't know if it was making fun of Disneyland or not, but it was funny. Always made me laugh. This always reminded me of Chuck E. Cheese. The big foot scene was hilarious as well. The supporting cast work even Pauley Shore as Max's friend, Bobby. I'm just glad, he had a small role. Good to see Jim Cummings voicing Pete. He is a voice actor legend. The animation was pretty OK, it wasn't catchy. It look like animation, you give a TV show, not a full length animation movie. The title also is kinda wrong. It's not a Goofy movie, but a movie about Max. Goofy only plays a supporting role in the film. Kinda like a second banana. I do have to say the movie have a musical like theme throughout the film. I love every song in the film. After Today is 'The Part of your world' emotional ballad for the Disney teenager male setting the table type song that mostly sang by Disney heroines. The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. "On the Open Road" and 'Nobody Else But You" are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out. The second uses a much more clich&eacute; theme of old vs. new, and though it does work and is interesting, never goes the extra mile to address anything of true importance. So I like this movie, better. Overall: There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me. It had an old concept, the buddy/father-son/coming-of-age adolescence film. But it did it in just a very fresh, very appealing way for me.

    A Goofy Movie is one of greatest and most memorable Disney movies of the 90's time period, which is saying something considering the 90's was their best decade in movies! And hands down, one of the best soundtracks by far! Max is the son of Goofy, and is getting ready to make a big splash on the last day of school by doing a live spoof of his favorite singers songs, Powerline. Powerline is a mix of Prince and Michael Jackson and sounds like MJ, even doing a bit of a moonwalk type of dance. Max gets into trouble for this and while in the principals office, runs into his long time crush, Roxanne. She invites him to a screening of Powerline's concert at her friends house over the summer and he has to turn her down because of an impromptu decision by Goofy to take Max on a cross country road trip in a desperate attempt to connect with him. Max lies to Roxanne and tells her that he is going to be at the concert, and starts his journey with his dad. The movie is full of classic Goofy moments, awesome lessons on father/son bonding, hijinks and adventures. The best songs on the soundtrack are I2I, Stand Out, After Today, and Nobody Else But You...all of which will have you singing along after the first time you hear it!

    What made me suddenly come and write a review to a movie that released over a decade and a half ago? The answer is simple. This movie is sincere and touching, exciting and hilarious, tear inducing and magical. I remember seeing this as a kid and have watched it every year almost after that. It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again over decades and it will still be fresh, entertaining and lovely. This movie is a definitive example of great, beautiful emotion that captures you and tugs at your heartstrings with its pure relatable and touching emotional storyline. SPOILERS AHEAD: A story about a father and son duo on a cross country trip with different plans and a story of parent-child bonding and seeing each others perspectives. A story that had me in tears with its honesty and masterful as well as emotional storytelling. It has intelligent wit and humor as well as catchy song that i still find myself humming 17 years later. These days many animated films rely on the quality of animation but have a shallow story. This one, a great classic gem from the past, has lovely animation and a smart, intelligent and heart filled story that just warms your heart and has you in smiles and tears through out. An accurate depiction of father-son relationships and teenagers. One of those larger than life films i will see with my kids. They don't make fantastic, animated adventure films this great anymore. Very few live up to it. Saw it on TV and was reminded of its heart warming, action packed adventure filled with some of the greatest humor Disney films have ever incorporated. A fun magical ride for all generations and a classic whose status as one of the best will be cemented int he years to come. SOME of the greatest films of all time are underrated and this gem is one of them. A testament to when animated films had that something special, something very few animated films can regenerate these days.

    I haven't seen anything from Disney forever, so watching this movie I had to make some choices earlier on with judging characters. Goofy is, well goofy! Max is a teenager. He likes a girl. It all works since it's basically a cartoon version of a dramatic high school story. With father and son troubles and other adventures. I find it amusing how goofy just never seemed to notice that his son wasn't happy, and when he did he misunderstood the sadness and tried to interpret it to his views. By the end of the movie, things are cleared between them and things seem well, even if it IS still goofy. I was pretty much fine with the movie as a while, since I haven't seen every show in the past and don't remember much, it's hard to honestly judge. But I say 8/10 to be fair.

    When I picked this movie all I could think of all the great memories that came along with it. Starting off with the great music that was in it. The catchy lyrics from "After Today" and "I2I". I also still loved how maturity that could be found in this most simple parts. An example being with how Goofy reacts to finding out that Max, his son, lied to him. I love the way the worked in some light fourth wall jokes like having Donald Duck and Mickey join in on the song," All in All" while being lost in the middle of the highway to The little Mermaid light switch. I also enjoyed how the growth of relationship between Max and Goofy. Overall I loved this movie and hope it becomes a real Disney Classic. I also enjoyed the music video with Lou Bega doing the cleaned up verison of Mambo No. 5. In short,a great movie and wonderful DVD release to boot!

    I never though that this movie would be any good, until I saw it on Cinema when I was little. I didn't remember this movie to be that good until I re-watched it as an adult. This movie capture the relation between father and son perfectly. On one side you have a typical child having a crush on a girl as he tries to act cool and draws her attention in every opportunity, and on the other side is the most uncool father a child would ever wish to have that could ruin his reputation in an instant. Max values "coolness" greatly and tries to sever any relation he has with his goofy bloodline (even though his bloodline is occasionally catching up to him in the form of embarrassing Goofyish trademark subconscious laughs). Goofy on the other hand is the caring father, that is oblivious of the worlds recent trends, have no idea what being cool is or how his action can damage his son's reputation, and believe that every experience he had at his younger years, will work just as well on his son. Thus begin an journey where Goofy will learn to respect his son and realize that not two people are the same, and Max will have to accept and learn to appreciate his father for what he is. Also worth to note is that there is no main villain in this movie. Disney's traditional antagonist Black Pit plays an important role, but he never does anything bad, he does't sabotage the heroes's goal in any way, he don't wish bad for them, he does't get punished in the end, he even tries to help the occasionally with advices that he thinks are good. His role in the story is to represent a different opinion of how a father should interact with his son, and even though he is presented as the bad example, there is no solid proof that his model is entirely wrong. This movie could had worked as well with any random cast of characters, but for some reason Disney threw goofy in those shoes, and that was both good and bad. On the good side, Goofy's recognizably goofy and slapstick personality fits perfectly the uncool father, without making him annoying to the viewer. On the bad side, most people thought of this movie as a long Goofy cartoon and it didn't get the recognition it deserves. The movie designed to entertain and teach equally to both the child and the parrent. You should give it a shot.

    In spite of having been a faithful Goof Troop regular watcher when it aired, I hadn't watched A Goofy Movie until yesterday, 16 years since it was in theatres. And I have to say, I have no regrets! The movie was far more deeper than I imagined. I expected a lighthearted movie with plenty of laughs, and I got that, and more, and I was impressed by how well they fleshed out the characters. I would definitely consider A Goofy Movie an underrated Disney movie, in my eyes. Whether or not you're looking for the nostaliga rush that I got when I saw it or just looking for a good family movie to watch with your family, I highly recommend A Goofy Movie!

    Disney's A Goofy Movie may not be one of their best films but it still holds up to this day in my opinion. A funny movie about Goofy and his son. Poor Max is not very popular at school and he has a crush on a girl named Roxanne. He wants to be popular with his fellow students and Roxanne so he decides to dress up like his favorite singer Powerline and put on a show for the last day of school. He of course succeeds and everyone takes an immediate liking to him. (If life were really that simple) Max gets invited to a Powerline concert that will air on television by Roxanne but he has to cut it short when Goofy plans on taking him on vacation after his Principal insists that he is in big trouble for causing an uproar at the school. Goofy thinks that by taking his son on vacation and bonding with him he won't end up going down the wrong path. Unfortunately Max has to break his plans with Roxanne but before he leaves he lies to her about his dad knowing Powerline and that they are going to meet up with him. Max and Goofy head out and they get into a few adventures that make Max realize that his dad only wanted what was best for him. As for the rest I won't spoil it but it makes for a tearful happy ending. While A Goofy Movie isn't considered a masterpiece classic it is still worth watching and an overall enjoyable experience.

    The tag-line couldn't be more appropriate! It IS hard to be cool when your dad is Goofy! Lucky he's not my father or yours, eh? Poor young Max! Goofy's cool dude 14-year-old son Max will go as far as taking it upon himself to ruin a school assembly by the principal to impress his bashful girlfriend Roxanne (Principal Mazor is the principal's name - WHY???!!! Something a little more fictitious would've been better I'd say). Even when he's in big trouble with Mazor he can only think of the fact that he's failed to impress Roxanne - he thinks! She loved his dance on the stage and would love to go on a date with him!... Not if Goofy's got anything to do with it! He is completely obsessed with his son 'Maxie' as he always patronizingly calls him and whisks him away from home to go on a holiday, against Max's will! Goofy doesn't give a toss about Max and his love-life and now Max is very much likely to lose Roxanne! To the end, Goofy is totally selfish and even reduces to taking enjoyment in cruelly humiliating Max at the most worn-down theme park I've ever seen! Luckily enough, the opportunity to break free of Goofy's clutches occurs when he goes to sleep in the car and Max has the map right in front of him! Max quietly makes alterations to the map taking them both to Los Angeles where Max intends to join a famous pop-star to make for a good enough excuse for missing his date with Roxanne. What else was the poor lad supposed to do?! I'd have done the same! So when Goofy finds out about Max's plan by looking at the map himself, he is in no position whatsoever of feeling angry with his son!... GOOFY: You lied to me! MAX: I had to - you were ruining my life! Why should anybody have their lives being ruined?! Anyway it all ends happily because Max both builds a bond with Goofy and finally wins his girlfriend over!

    Having grown up watching it, it's one of my personal favorite kid movies of the 1990's. If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves.

I would definitely consider A Goofy Movie an underrated Disney movie, in my eyes. Whether or not you're looking for the nostaliga rush that I got when I saw it or just looking for a good family movie to watch with your family, I highly recommend A Goofy Movie!

    Disney's A Goofy Movie may not be one of their best films but it still holds up to this day in my opinion. A funny movie about Goofy and his son. Poor Max is not very popular at school and he has a crush on a girl named Roxanne. He wants to be popular with his fellow students and Roxanne so he decides to dress up like his favorite singer Powerline and put on a show for the last day of school. He of course succeeds and everyone takes an immediate liking to him. (If life were really that simple) Max gets invited to a Powerline concert that will air on television by Roxanne but he has to cut it short when Goofy plans on taking him on vacation after his Principal insists that he is in big trouble for causing an uproar at the school. Goofy thinks that by taking his son on vacation and bonding with him he won't end up going down the wrong path. Unfortunately Max has to break his plans with Roxanne but before he leaves he lies to her about his dad knowing Powerline and that they are going to meet up with him. Max and Goofy head out and they get into a few adventures that make Max realize that his dad only wanted what was best for him. As for the rest I won't spoil it but it makes for a tearful happy ending. While A Goofy Movie isn't considered a masterpiece classic it is still worth watching and an overall enjoyable experience.

    The tag-line couldn't be more appropriate! It IS hard to be cool when your dad is Goofy! Lucky he's not my father or yours, eh? Poor young Max! Goofy's cool dude 14-year-old son Max will go as far as taking it upon himself to ruin a school assembly by the principal to impress his bashful girlfriend Roxanne (Principal Mazor is the principal's name - WHY???!!! Something a little more fictitious would've been better I'd say). Even when he's in big trouble with Mazor he can only think of the fact that he's failed to impress Roxanne - he thinks! She loved his dance on the stage and would love to go on a date with him!... Not if Goofy's got anything to do with it! He is completely obsessed with his son 'Maxie' as he always patronizingly calls him and whisks him away from home to go on a holiday, against Max's will! Goofy doesn't give a toss about Max and his love-life and now Max is very much likely to lose Roxanne! To the end, Goofy is totally selfish and even reduces to taking enjoyment in cruelly humiliating Max at the most worn-down theme park I've ever seen! Luckily enough, the opportunity to break free of Goofy's clutches occurs when he goes to sleep in the car and Max has the map right in front of him! Max quietly makes alterations to the map taking them both to Los Angeles where Max intends to join a famous pop-star to make for a good enough excuse for missing his date with Roxanne. What else was the poor lad supposed to do?! I'd have done the same! So when Goofy finds out about Max's plan by looking at the map himself, he is in no position whatsoever of feeling angry with his son!... GOOFY: You lied to me! MAX: I had to - you were ruining my life! Why should anybody have their lives being ruined?! Anyway it all ends happily because Max both builds a bond with Goofy and finally wins his girlfriend over!

    Having grown up watching it, it's one of my personal favorite kid movies of the 1990's. If you ever wanted to take a 90's nostalgia summer road trip, A Goofy Movie is a great place to start. The entire movie just screams 90's. When the animated series Goof Troop aired on television in 1992, it was very popular to the point that a sequel movie had to be made. In 1995, such a film was indeed made, titled 'A Goofy Movie'. Directed by Kevin Lima, the movie is about the father & son relationship between Goofy (Voice by Bill Farmer) and his son Max (Voice by Jason Marsden). Max got into trouble in school trying to impress the girl of his dreams, Roxanne (Voice by Kellie Martin), and now Goofy believes that Max is growing up too fast, and fears of losing him to a life of crime. While Max believes in his independence, and wanting no part with his father, Goofy. Goofy want to work on their tense relationship, by wanting a family cross country trip to Lake Destiny, Idaho for some father and son bonding while fishing. The only problem is that Max promised to Roxanne, the girl he has a crush on, that he'll be at the Powerline concert in L.A. This gives Max the problem of whether to tell the truth to Roxanne or screw up Goofy's fishing trip just to be at the concert. While the movie is a cartoon, and it has a lot of humor. I do find it's mature in some places. It focuses a lot of the chemistry between father and son. This was the first time, I even saw Goofy as a father figure. While on Goof Troop, Goofy was still a father to Max, but the character on the show never went into development. He was always a stupid adult of a person who can't do anything right. In the film version, we see how his dad's antics has alienated the boy to the point, that he fears being like him, due to people mocking them. Max is actually growing, and I can totally see him as a teen. Max is one of the most believable Disney character that I can related to. Max, much to his own dismay, takes after his father at times, whether it be mannerisms (including Goofy's trademark laugh) or occasionally being clumsy. He feels that he is much cooler than Goofy however, and is not as earnest and humble as his father, as he can be somewhat of a show-off at times when he excels at anything. Adolescents are very private about their interests and are especially reluctant about sharing them with their parents. While Goofy is still clumsy, he works hard to be a good father towards Max. Goofy wasn't one-dimensional in the film like he is in his earlier cartoons. Who knew, Goofy could show angry, pain, and love? It's one of the very first Disney movie seems to actually try and convey the generational conflict between parent and child; and portrays this relationship in a very real way, full of ups and downs. I can't think of another Disney movie before this, going to this level. I think the movie works so well because of that. I have a soft spot for this movie - simply because it mirrors a lot of people teenage years so much. The embarrassing parent, the awkward kid who just wants the world to know that they're more than just some curb stomp, and wanting to prove themselves. I have to admit, it was probably this movie that convinced me to come out of my shell and made the rest of my life more enjoyable and memorable. I have to say the humor works, physical slapstick, and jokes. Some of its jokes are pretty out there like odd breaking the fourth wall humor. I loved the Lester's possum park. I don't know if it was making fun of Disneyland or not, but it was funny. Always made me laugh. This always reminded me of Chuck E. Cheese. The big foot scene was hilarious as well. The supporting cast work even Pauley Shore as Max's friend, Bobby. I'm just glad, he had a small role. Good to see Jim Cummings voicing Pete. He is a voice actor legend. The animation was pretty OK, it wasn't catchy. It look like animation, you give a TV show, not a full length animation movie. The title also is kinda wrong. It's not a Goofy movie, but a movie about Max. Goofy only plays a supporting role in the film. Kinda like a second banana. I do have to say the movie have a musical like theme throughout the film. I love every song in the film. After Today is 'The Part of your world' emotional ballad for the Disney teenager male setting the table type song that mostly sang by Disney heroines. The Tevin Campbell songs 'Stand Out' and 'Eye and Eye' are catchy. "On the Open Road" and 'Nobody Else But You" are just too cheesy for me. I don't know, but I always thought Powerline was supposed to be Bobby Brown or Michael Jackson. A direct to video sequel was made in 2000 worth checking out. The second uses a much more clich&eacute; theme of old vs. new, and though it does work and is interesting, never goes the extra mile to address anything of true importance. So I like this movie, better. Overall: There is something for both parents and the children with this film. It just had the right mix of elements for me. It had an old concept, the buddy/father-son/coming-of-age adolescence film. But it did it in just a very fresh, very appealing way for me.

    A Goofy Movie is one of greatest and most memorable Disney movies of the 90's time period, which is saying something considering the 90's was their best decade in movies! And hands down, one of the best soundtracks by far! Max is the son of Goofy, and is getting ready to make a big splash on the last day of school by doing a live spoof of his favorite singers songs, Powerline. Powerline is a mix of Prince and Michael Jackson and sounds like MJ, even doing a bit of a moonwalk type of dance. Max gets into trouble for this and while in the principals office, runs into his long time crush, Roxanne. She invites him to a screening of Powerline's concert at her friends house over the summer and he has to turn her down because of an impromptu decision by Goofy to take Max on a cross country road trip in a desperate attempt to connect with him. Max lies to Roxanne and tells her that he is going to be at the concert, and starts his journey with his dad. The movie is full of classic Goofy moments, awesome lessons on father/son bonding, hijinks and adventures. The best songs on the soundtrack are I2I, Stand Out, After Today, and Nobody Else But You...all of which will have you singing along after the first time you hear it!

    What made me suddenly come and write a review to a movie that released over a decade and a half ago? The answer is simple. This movie is sincere and touching, exciting and hilarious, tear inducing and magical. I remember seeing this as a kid and have watched it every year almost after that. It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again over decades and it will still be fresh, entertaining and lovely. This movie is a definitive example of great, beautiful emotion that captures you and tugs at your heartstrings with its pure relatable and touching emotional storyline. SPOILERS AHEAD: A story about a father and son duo on a cross country trip with different plans and a story of parent-child bonding and seeing each others perspectives. A story that had me in tears with its honesty and masterful as well as emotional storytelling. It has intelligent wit and humor as well as catchy song that i still find myself humming 17 years later. These days many animated films rely on the quality of animation but have a shallow story. This one, a great classic gem from the past, has lovely animation and a smart, intelligent and heart filled story that just warms your heart and has you in smiles and tears through out. An accurate depiction of father-son relationships and teenagers. One of those larger than life films i will see with my kids. They don't make fantastic, animated adventure films this great anymore. Very few live up to it. Saw it on TV and was reminded of its heart warming, action packed adventure filled with some of the greatest humor Disney films have ever incorporated. A fun magical ride for all generations and a classic whose status as one of the best will be cemented int he years to come. SOME of the greatest films of all time are underrated and this gem is one of them. A testament to when animated films had that something special, something very few animated films can regenerate these days.

    I haven't seen anything from Disney forever, so watching this movie I had to make some choices earlier on with judging characters. Goofy is, well goofy! Max is a teenager. He likes a girl. It all works since it's basically a cartoon version of a dramatic high school story. With father and son troubles and other adventures. I find it amusing how goofy just never seemed to notice that his son wasn't happy, and when he did he misunderstood the sadness and tried to interpret it to his views. By the end of the movie, things are cleared between them and things seem well, even if it IS still goofy. I was pretty much fine with the movie as a while, since I haven't seen every show in the past and don't remember much, it's hard to honestly judge. But I say 8/10 to be fair.

    When I picked this movie all I could think of all the great memories that came along with it. Starting off with the great music that was in it. The catchy lyrics from "After Today" and "I2I". I also still loved how maturity that could be found in this most simple parts. An example being with how Goofy reacts to finding out that Max, his son, lied to him. I love the way the worked in some light fourth wall jokes like having Donald Duck and Mickey join in on the song," All in All" while being lost in the middle of the highway to The little Mermaid light switch. I also enjoyed how the growth of relationship between Max and Goofy. Overall I loved this movie and hope it becomes a real Disney Classic. I also enjoyed the music video with Lou Bega doing the cleaned up verison of Mambo No. 5. In short,a great movie and wonderful DVD release to boot!

    I never though that this movie would be any good, until I saw it on Cinema when I was little. I didn't remember this movie to be that good until I re-watched it as an adult. This movie capture the relation between father and son perfectly. On one side you have a typical child having a crush on a girl as he tries to act cool and draws her attention in every opportunity, and on the other side is the most uncool father a child would ever wish to have that could ruin his reputation in an instant. Max values "coolness" greatly and tries to sever any relation he has with his goofy bloodline (even though his bloodline is occasionally catching up to him in the form of embarrassing Goofyish trademark subconscious laughs). Goofy on the other hand is the caring father, that is oblivious of the worlds recent trends, have no idea what being cool is or how his action can damage his son's reputation, and believe that every experience he had at his younger years, will work just as well on his son. Thus begin an journey where Goofy will learn to respect his son and realize that not two people are the same, and Max will have to accept and learn to appreciate his father for what he is. Also worth to note is that there is no main villain in this movie. Disney's traditional antagonist Black Pit plays an important role, but he never does anything bad, he does't sabotage the heroes's goal in any way, he don't wish bad for them, he does't get punished in the end, he even tries to help the occasionally with advices that he thinks are good. His role in the story is to represent a different opinion of how a father should interact with his son, and even though he is presented as the bad example, there is no solid proof that his model is entirely wrong. This movie could had worked as well with any random cast of characters, but for some reason Disney threw goofy in those shoes, and that was both good and bad. On the good side, Goofy's recognizably goofy and slapstick personality fits perfectly the uncool father, without making him annoying to the viewer. On the bad side, most people thought of this movie as a long Goofy cartoon and it didn't get the recognition it deserves. The movie designed to entertain and teach equally to both the child and the parrent. You should give it a shot.

    In spite of having been a faithful Goof Troop regular watcher when it aired, I hadn't watched A Goofy Movie until yesterday, 16 years since it was in theatres. And I have to say, I have no regrets! The movie was far more deeper than I imagined. I expected a lighthearted movie with plenty of laughs, and I got that, and more, and I was impressed by how well they fleshed out the characters.
