    This movie is rich! One of the richest out of the thousands I've seen. I had to pause it after every scene just to catch my breath and to digest the images and emotions that came from the screen. It is less like watching a movie and more like going to a painting exhibit of newly discovered Renoirs and Monets. The beauty and the music simply got my heart thumping, and then, all I can say is that the plot seems to emerge out of the art direction. Genius! It is impossible for me to free my mind now from the images, which are startlingly fresh, in the way that "Letyat zhuravli" (The Cranes are Flying) was in 1957, or the opening shot of "Cleo de 5 a 7" was in 1962. The composition of every shot is immaculately precise in the manner of Jacques Tati's "Monsieur Hulot" movies, or Godard's "Une femme mariee" (1964) or the magazine industry, but Agnes Varda's movie is greater than all of these, because whereas those are static, motionless, almost feeling-less projects, hers has somehow managed to come across fluidly, effortlessly, vividly as anything before or after until the works of Kieslowski. It felt like I was watching a scene out of some family's life in heaven, and then, one of the children looks at the camera and offers some fruit, as if Varda is winking at us and saying, "Enjoy, come in. Be a part of our wonderful time." Can life really be so wonderful as it is in this movie? The movie goes on to probe that very question. And I am better for it.

    'Happiness' is the best translation of the title for this brilliant, sad but complete movie. I saw it when I was happily married and worked for a huge publishing company. Later in life I saw the other films made by Agnes Varda. They all were very deep and made me emotional. The scene of the suicide in 'Le Bonheur' is filmed as a kind of hidden action of a woman who did not understand that her husband had so much love to give. I still don't understand WHAT made this movie so unbelievably brilliant. Maybe I should buy a DVD if available. Love is the only gift that made me change in my whole behavour. If I had to choose between the best movie and the choice was limited to 'Citizen Kane' and 'Le Bonheur', the second one I mention would win. The beauty of the filming itself was great and rich in all aspects. Well, dear reader, I'm going to look for a DVD of 'Le Bonheur.

    Watching this film the last time, some 45 years ago, upon it's original UK release, I was blown away. I felt I had never seen such beautiful sunny summer images, I was astonished at the use of posters and advertising hoardings for composition. I notice now that some of these aspects have coloured my own photographic sensitivities. I remember the film as one long celebration of happiness and the suggestion that with the right attitude life would be like this. Seeing it again, it is still undoubtedly beautiful and I possibly appreciate even more the wonderful cinematography, however, now I notice how subversive this movie is. I have a feeling that this is very much a personal film seen through Varda's eyes and she is suggesting that a woman might easily do as the second woman does in this without causing so much as a head to turn. I think not, this is fantasy. The guy is unreal, men don't lie around saying how happy they are all the time, never mind the way he fails to be affected by the incident. I imagine at the time I saw this as a depiction of a real possibility. I seem to remember thinking lots of things were possible in the 60s that have turned out not to be. Nevertheless, this is still a beautiful movie,

    Fran&ccedil;ois leads an idyllic life full of happiness. He loves his wife and their young children; he enjoys his work as a carpenter; and the country town where he lives is awash with sunshine and smiling faces. So when he meets a pretty girl working at the post office, what could be more natural and right than to take a further sip from the bowl of happiness? Le Bonheur is a delicious sugar-coated bonbon with a bitter centre. What disturbs the viewer most is the cool unjudging gaze of Varda's camera: the characters are naive but not cruel, and when tragedy strikes it comes about from a childlike pursuit of happiness. Then the seasons change, and life continues with no-one wiser than before... The emphatic pastel colour palette of the film, and the music of Mozart that plays insistently throughout, are beautiful and cloyingly seductive. They entice us into the innocent fantasy world of Fran&ccedil;ois, where all it takes to do the right thing is to follow your desires. What could possibly go wrong? Le Bonheur is an exquisite, delicate, ambiguous masterpiece of the type that Hollywood was, is and always will be incapable of producing.

    The film divides fairly neatly into 4 20-minute sections, as we follow first the apparently very happy marriage of Fran&ccedil;ois and his wife Therese with their two small children; the beginnings of Fran&ccedil;ois' affair with &Eacute;milie; the growing intensity of that affair and his disclosure of it to Therese; and the aftermath. There's no way to properly discuss this without serious spoilers, so I hope anyone reading this has seen the film. Throughout the film the music of Mozart is used, specifically the Clarinet Quintet, much of it enormously cheerful and beautiful but with a melancholy undertone always struggling to break to the surface - and this describes the film as well. Each segment of the film is broken up by a day in the country as the family leaves the confines of their medium-sized provincial city - each segment (save the last) begins in a carefree, naive and innocent happiness and the exquisite photography romances both the beautiful couple with their children and the countryside. Nothing could be more gorgeous... But in fact Fran&ccedil;ois seems to suffer from an excess of happiness - he actually says as much at one point - or rather, he is incapable of feeling anything deep at all and experiences only a shallow surface thrill at the beauty of both his wife and his new love. He can't ever really decide between them and seems unable to grasp that he should even be thinking in that way, and that there might be problems developing as a result. I don't think it's any coincidence that &Eacute;milie bears a strong resemblance to Therese - blonde, roughly the same height and build, affecting fairly similar clothing and in the end, doubling in every way for her predecessor. Fran&ccedil;ois doesn't really want something different - he wants more of the same - or rather, he just wants to adore and be adored in a simple and childish way without thought of consequences. Perhaps it wouldn't matter if &Eacute;milie was strikingly different from Therese - but then perhaps it wouldn't be as obvious to us that all the man sees is the surface, and one surface seems as good as another... At the climax of the film, the end of the third part, Fran&ccedil;ois confesses his affair, and it's obvious that he has no comprehension that it could be a problem - he has enough love for both of them, you see. But Therese, perhaps as incapable as he is of truly adult comprehension or communication, nevertheless is capable of rejection, and she does so in dramatic and final fashion, forcing him to choose by removing herself from the equation. At the end, &Eacute;milie has replaced her in every way and the only person who has apparently learned anything is the one who ended her life. Varda deliberately creates a film that is all bold surfaces and colors - bright reds, pastel blues and greens, sunny yellows - and it is her use of color and editing that define the melancholy that underlies the happiness. When &Eacute;milie shows Fran&ccedil;ois her apartment for the first time there is a series of very quick cuts that show her possessions as Fran&ccedil;ois looks around, as if to show that in a few seconds he has taken in all he needs to, that he has found what he's looking for and doesn't need to think about it. And he never does. All three characters are fairly shallow, at least the film doesn't explicitly show us anything much to contradict that, and this leads to an extraordinarily cynical feeling, particularly on a second viewing for me - really, she seems to be saying, if we don't think and don't communicate with each other, if all we want is happiness, then what difference does it make if one person drowns herself - if that was her choice? One woman is as good as another, a new mother can do the same job as the original, let's just go on with our daily lives and forget about the darkness. The sole person who may have actually thought matters through with any understanding, Therese, is ultimately the one who can't exist in this world. It's also helpful in watching this I think - or at least, it gives the film even greater resonance - if one has seen "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg", made the previous year by Varda's husband Jacques Demy, which makes a fascinating counterpoint. Where "Le Bonheur" has the rhythmic feel and glossy surface of a musical, the Demy film actually is one; and where Varda's film actually ends up a tragedy - but wrapped up in cozy beauty - Demy's film is only a Hollywood tragedy. Did the wife make her savage piece of cynicism in response to her husband's bittersweet romance? I don't know, but it's fascinating to think about the many parallels... On the whole, I think "Le Bonheur" is one of the key French films of the 60s, it stands for me with the much-better known works of Godard, Truffaut and Chabrol from the decade and it is certainly a powerful philosophical statement about the nature of relationships, fidelity, "happiness."

    This is the first of Agnes Varda's works that I have seen and I have to first say that I was taken by the beauty that she puts into the picture. The use of color and the images she uses, how she frames them and the positioning of the camera in just the right spot...all of that create a beautiful picture that is just breathtaking. And the music (Mozart, I believe, though I am relatively unschooled in classical music) is wonderful and fits in to the picture perfectly. The story centers around Francois, a carpenter, his wife Claire, his children and his mistress, Emilie. The film begins with a beautiful buildup of an idyllic family life and a perfect marriage-too perfect in fact, and this probably reflects Francois' perception of reality and his delusions which continue throughout the film. They are a happy family with a great home life and frequent family trips to the country. Then Francois meets Emilie, a telegraph worker, with whom he also falls in love. He begins an affair with her, finding her to complement the relationship he has with his wife. And he believes that, because he is so happy with her and his love for his wife also seems to have grown with this affair, his wife will be happy with this state of affairs. And so he tells her, but the tragic results of that are not what he expects.. The story in part shows the naivety of people in love-even love where the participants shouldn't expect approval based on social norms. Lovers seem reluctant to believe that their love can hurt anyone or that anyone would wish their love to be otherwise. There is a selfishness about infatuation that throws up blinders around reality. Francois expects his wife to approve of the affair as he's totally wrapped up in his own feelings, a selfishness that is unconscious and unrecognized, so that he doesn't see the effect his betrayal might have on his partner. In fact, he doesn't even see it as betrayal. There is a fundamental inequality in his marriage, and Francois has mistaken his own feelings and desires for the communal feelings and desires that should be part of a truly idyllic marriage. Is such a relationship really possible? I don't know and Varda doesn't give us much hope, but it is clear that it is not possible if there is a fundamental selfishness and lack of respect in the partnership. This film developed a sense of unease within me, even in the early part and that just intensified throughout the movie as the plot and the affair deepened and Francois' apparent delusions of emotional reality became more evident. Though I didn't foresee the climax specifically, it was clear that things couldn't continue as blissfully as they appeared. The ending disturbed me most of all. This is a beautiful film and one that has many messages about relationships, marriage and society.

    How do you rate a film like this? It wasn't really made to be rated. Unfortunately, we live in bonehead times when American idol has made every loser a critic. So, I give it an 7 based only on my purely subjective view, compared to other films that have made a mark. One moronic reviewer writes this film off as "A perfect little nothing...Agnes Varda's Le Bonheur is a perfect little composition. A nice, sweet portrait...There is no fault in this film, except that it feels a little empty. Varda's hand is light and inspired, and about as dramatic as its cheerful score...a wonderful ode to a summer's day, with barely a hint of winter." Gag. That person obviously only watched part of the film (or, more than likely, played it in the background while surfing the internet) or he/she suffers from a Jeffrey Dahmer-like view of the world. Believe me, the light and airy music and cinematography is there to fool you. Look deeper and there's some wicked commentary going on. Varda's films are more valuable than film school for emerging filmmakers (unless you aspire to be one of those big-mouth "Film Makers" who loves to spout off in the video store or Starbucks). This is a movie for people who can sit and watch. Not those who need to be spoon-fed their movies and can't sit for five minutes without fondling a cell phone.

    There's something dreamlike about the way the main male character of this film drifts through it. And it is a treat to look at. Both his wife and his mistress are beautiful, as is some of the scenery. Note the extraordinary way Varda uses colour to distinguish the female characters, the clothes of wife sunflower yellow, of the mistress cornflower blue. That colour coding extends to the places around them. The only film I have seen with an even remotely similar colour sense is "Les Parapluies de Cherbourg" by Jacques Demy, Varda's husband. Le Bonheur never gives us a clear guide to what the main characters really fee. They live on the surface of their emotions but as an aesthetic experience the film is outstanding.

    A thing non-French users may not know:at the time,the male star,Jean-Claude Drouot was the brats' hero,Thierry la Fronde ,a miniseries where he portrayed a young French noble fighting against the "villains" (eg: the English) during the Hundred Years war. Casting the whole Drouot family (husband,wife,and children who all keep their first names in real life) was a risqu&eacute; move for the sixties;And involving daddy in adultery was not particularly what they call "playing safe" ;and proving that the pursuit of happiness is legitimate and normal,even if they 've got someone's blood on their hands,it takes the biscuit.. Pastel colors and the delightful cinematography display Varda's husband,Jacques Demy 's influence;the first part shows everyday life in a way both realistic and poetic. But ,sincerely,frank,I would not have expected that from feminist Varda.

    A man in a happy marriage with two kids begins an affair, sincerely feeling he has enough love for both women and that neither one will be loved less. To start with, it's absolutely beautiful to look at. Varda always seems to know exactly what to do with the image, where to put the camera, which direction to move, when to cut, what color to fade to; everything is absolutely perfect. Moreover, the film is completely fascinating first because Varda deals with her subject with a rare honesty and forgiveness. Not a single character is unlikeable. Even if you see error in the husband's thinking, it is clear he believes with all of his heart that he truly can love both of these women at once and you sympathize with his sincerity. The wife is easy to care for, a good mother and very devoted, and the mistress is not someone you feel compelled to hate, either. She's not out to break up this marriage and she seems to really need this love. And what makes the film endlessly interesting is in how ambiguous Varda is about her own feelings. She never leads you to pick a side, never encourages you to see one specific viewpoint or leave the film feeling a particular way about what happened. While the music (Mozart is used throughout most of the film) in the last 15 minutes would seem to suggest anger at the way things have turned out, you can also look at the early stages of the film and see the image of the idyllic family with pastoral music as too perfect a presentation, one that is not entirely believable. Varda even hints at this herself; after we've watched about five minutes of this family picnicking in the woods, she cuts almost immediately to nearly the same image in a TV advertisement, suggesting that a marriage that happy only exists in commercials to begin with.

    'Happiness' is the best translation of the title for this brilliant, sad but complete movie. I saw it when I was happily married and worked for a huge publishing company. Later in life I saw the other films made by Agnes Varda. They all were very deep and made me emotional. The scene of the suicide in 'Le Bonheur' is filmed as a kind of hidden action of a woman who did not understand that her husband had so much love to give. I still don't understand WHAT made this movie so unbelievably brilliant. Maybe I should buy a DVD if available. Love is the only gift that made me change in my whole behavour. If I had to choose between the best movie and the choice was limited to 'Citizen Kane' and 'Le Bonheur', the second one I mention would win. The beauty of the filming itself was great and rich in all aspects. Well, dear reader, I'm going to look for a DVD of 'Le Bonheur.

    Fran&ccedil;ois leads an idyllic life full of happiness. He loves his wife and their young children; he enjoys his work as a carpenter; and the country town where he lives is awash with sunshine and smiling faces. So when he meets a pretty girl working at the post office, what could be more natural and right than to take a further sip from the bowl of happiness? Le Bonheur is a delicious sugar-coated bonbon with a bitter centre. What disturbs the viewer most is the cool unjudging gaze of Varda's camera: the characters are naive but not cruel, and when tragedy strikes it comes about from a childlike pursuit of happiness. Then the seasons change, and life continues with no-one wiser than before... The emphatic pastel colour palette of the film, and the music of Mozart that plays insistently throughout, are beautiful and cloyingly seductive. They entice us into the innocent fantasy world of Fran&ccedil;ois, where all it takes to do the right thing is to follow your desires. What could possibly go wrong? Le Bonheur is an exquisite, delicate, ambiguous masterpiece of the type that Hollywood was, is and always will be incapable of producing.

    The film divides fairly neatly into 4 20-minute sections, as we follow first the apparently very happy marriage of Fran&ccedil;ois and his wife Therese with their two small children; the beginnings of Fran&ccedil;ois' affair with &Eacute;milie; the growing intensity of that affair and his disclosure of it to Therese; and the aftermath. There's no way to properly discuss this without serious spoilers, so I hope anyone reading this has seen the film. Throughout the film the music of Mozart is used, specifically the Clarinet Quintet, much of it enormously cheerful and beautiful but with a melancholy undertone always struggling to break to the surface - and this describes the film as well. Each segment of the film is broken up by a day in the country as the family leaves the confines of their medium-sized provincial city - each segment (save the last) begins in a carefree, naive and innocent happiness and the exquisite photography romances both the beautiful couple with their children and the countryside. Nothing could be more gorgeous... But in fact Fran&ccedil;ois seems to suffer from an excess of happiness - he actually says as much at one point - or rather, he is incapable of feeling anything deep at all and experiences only a shallow surface thrill at the beauty of both his wife and his new love. He can't ever really decide between them and seems unable to grasp that he should even be thinking in that way, and that there might be problems developing as a result. I don't think it's any coincidence that &Eacute;milie bears a strong resemblance to Therese - blonde, roughly the same height and build, affecting fairly similar clothing and in the end, doubling in every way for her predecessor. Fran&ccedil;ois doesn't really want something different - he wants more of the same - or rather, he just wants to adore and be adored in a simple and childish way without thought of consequences. Perhaps it wouldn't matter if &Eacute;milie was strikingly different from Therese - but then perhaps it wouldn't be as obvious to us that all the man sees is the surface, and one surface seems as good as another... At the climax of the film, the end of the third part, Fran&ccedil;ois confesses his affair, and it's obvious that he has no comprehension that it could be a problem - he has enough love for both of them, you see. But Therese, perhaps as incapable as he is of truly adult comprehension or communication, nevertheless is capable of rejection, and she does so in dramatic and final fashion, forcing him to choose by removing herself from the equation. At the end, &Eacute;milie has replaced her in every way and the only person who has apparently learned anything is the one who ended her life. Varda deliberately creates a film that is all bold surfaces and colors - bright reds, pastel blues and greens, sunny yellows - and it is her use of color and editing that define the melancholy that underlies the happiness. When &Eacute;milie shows Fran&ccedil;ois her apartment for the first time there is a series of very quick cuts that show her possessions as Fran&ccedil;ois looks around, as if to show that in a few seconds he has taken in all he needs to, that he has found what he's looking for and doesn't need to think about it. And he never does. All three characters are fairly shallow, at least the film doesn't explicitly show us anything much to contradict that, and this leads to an extraordinarily cynical feeling, particularly on a second viewing for me - really, she seems to be saying, if we don't think and don't communicate with each other, if all we want is happiness, then what difference does it make if one person drowns herself - if that was her choice? One woman is as good as another, a new mother can do the same job as the original, let's just go on with our daily lives and forget about the darkness. The sole person who may have actually thought matters through with any understanding, Therese, is ultimately the one who can't exist in this world. It's also helpful in watching this I think - or at least, it gives the film even greater resonance - if one has seen "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg", made the previous year by Varda's husband Jacques Demy, which makes a fascinating counterpoint. Where "Le Bonheur" has the rhythmic feel and glossy surface of a musical, the Demy film actually is one; and where Varda's film actually ends up a tragedy - but wrapped up in cozy beauty - Demy's film is only a Hollywood tragedy. Did the wife make her savage piece of cynicism in response to her husband's bittersweet romance? I don't know, but it's fascinating to think about the many parallels... On the whole, I think "Le Bonheur" is one of the key French films of the 60s, it stands for me with the much-better known works of Godard, Truffaut and Chabrol from the decade and it is certainly a powerful philosophical statement about the nature of relationships, fidelity, "happiness."

    This is the first of Agnes Varda's works that I have seen and I have to first say that I was taken by the beauty that she puts into the picture. The use of color and the images she uses, how she frames them and the positioning of the camera in just the right spot...all of that create a beautiful picture that is just breathtaking. And the music (Mozart, I believe, though I am relatively unschooled in classical music) is wonderful and fits in to the picture perfectly. The story centers around Francois, a carpenter, his wife Claire, his children and his mistress, Emilie. The film begins with a beautiful buildup of an idyllic family life and a perfect marriage-too perfect in fact, and this probably reflects Francois' perception of reality and his delusions which continue throughout the film. They are a happy family with a great home life and frequent family trips to the country. Then Francois meets Emilie, a telegraph worker, with whom he also falls in love. He begins an affair with her, finding her to complement the relationship he has with his wife. And he believes that, because he is so happy with her and his love for his wife also seems to have grown with this affair, his wife will be happy with this state of affairs. And so he tells her, but the tragic results of that are not what he expects.. The story in part shows the naivety of people in love-even love where the participants shouldn't expect approval based on social norms. Lovers seem reluctant to believe that their love can hurt anyone or that anyone would wish their love to be otherwise. There is a selfishness about infatuation that throws up blinders around reality. Francois expects his wife to approve of the affair as he's totally wrapped up in his own feelings, a selfishness that is unconscious and unrecognized, so that he doesn't see the effect his betrayal might have on his partner. In fact, he doesn't even see it as betrayal. There is a fundamental inequality in his marriage, and Francois has mistaken his own feelings and desires for the communal feelings and desires that should be part of a truly idyllic marriage. Is such a relationship really possible? I don't know and Varda doesn't give us much hope, but it is clear that it is not possible if there is a fundamental selfishness and lack of respect in the partnership. This film developed a sense of unease within me, even in the early part and that just intensified throughout the movie as the plot and the affair deepened and Francois' apparent delusions of emotional reality became more evident. Though I didn't foresee the climax specifically, it was clear that things couldn't continue as blissfully as they appeared. The ending disturbed me most of all. This is a beautiful film and one that has many messages about relationships, marriage and society.

    How do you rate a film like this? It wasn't really made to be rated. Unfortunately, we live in bonehead times when American idol has made every loser a critic. So, I give it an 7 based only on my purely subjective view, compared to other films that have made a mark. One moronic reviewer writes this film off as "A perfect little nothing...Agnes Varda's Le Bonheur is a perfect little composition. A nice, sweet portrait...There is no fault in this film, except that it feels a little empty. Varda's hand is light and inspired, and about as dramatic as its cheerful score...a wonderful ode to a summer's day, with barely a hint of winter." Gag. That person obviously only watched part of the film (or, more than likely, played it in the background while surfing the internet) or he/she suffers from a Jeffrey Dahmer-like view of the world. Believe me, the light and airy music and cinematography is there to fool you. Look deeper and there's some wicked commentary going on. Varda's films are more valuable than film school for emerging filmmakers (unless you aspire to be one of those big-mouth "Film Makers" who loves to spout off in the video store or Starbucks). This is a movie for people who can sit and watch. Not those who need to be spoon-fed their movies and can't sit for five minutes without fondling a cell phone.

    There's something dreamlike about the way the main male character of this film drifts through it. And it is a treat to look at. Both his wife and his mistress are beautiful, as is some of the scenery. Note the extraordinary way Varda uses colour to distinguish the female characters, the clothes of wife sunflower yellow, of the mistress cornflower blue. That colour coding extends to the places around them. The only film I have seen with an even remotely similar colour sense is "Les Parapluies de Cherbourg" by Jacques Demy, Varda's husband. Le Bonheur never gives us a clear guide to what the main characters really fee. They live on the surface of their emotions but as an aesthetic experience the film is outstanding.

    A thing non-French users may not know:at the time,the male star,Jean-Claude Drouot was the brats' hero,Thierry la Fronde ,a miniseries where he portrayed a young French noble fighting against the "villains" (eg: the English) during the Hundred Years war. Casting the whole Drouot family (husband,wife,and children who all keep their first names in real life) was a risqu&eacute; move for the sixties;And involving daddy in adultery was not particularly what they call "playing safe" ;and proving that the pursuit of happiness is legitimate and normal,even if they 've got someone's blood on their hands,it takes the biscuit.. Pastel colors and the delightful cinematography display Varda's husband,Jacques Demy 's influence;the first part shows everyday life in a way both realistic and poetic. But ,sincerely,frank,I would not have expected that from feminist Varda.

    A man in a happy marriage with two kids begins an affair, sincerely feeling he has enough love for both women and that neither one will be loved less. To start with, it's absolutely beautiful to look at. Varda always seems to know exactly what to do with the image, where to put the camera, which direction to move, when to cut, what color to fade to; everything is absolutely perfect. Moreover, the film is completely fascinating first because Varda deals with her subject with a rare honesty and forgiveness. Not a single character is unlikeable. Even if you see error in the husband's thinking, it is clear he believes with all of his heart that he truly can love both of these women at once and you sympathize with his sincerity. The wife is easy to care for, a good mother and very devoted, and the mistress is not someone you feel compelled to hate, either. She's not out to break up this marriage and she seems to really need this love. And what makes the film endlessly interesting is in how ambiguous Varda is about her own feelings. She never leads you to pick a side, never encourages you to see one specific viewpoint or leave the film feeling a particular way about what happened. While the music (Mozart is used throughout most of the film) in the last 15 minutes would seem to suggest anger at the way things have turned out, you can also look at the early stages of the film and see the image of the idyllic family with pastoral music as too perfect a presentation, one that is not entirely believable. Varda even hints at this herself; after we've watched about five minutes of this family picnicking in the woods, she cuts almost immediately to nearly the same image in a TV advertisement, suggesting that a marriage that happy only exists in commercials to begin with.

    This movie is rich! One of the richest out of the thousands I've seen. I had to pause it after every scene just to catch my breath and to digest the images and emotions that came from the screen. It is less like watching a movie and more like going to a painting exhibit of newly discovered Renoirs and Monets. The beauty and the music simply got my heart thumping, and then, all I can say is that the plot seems to emerge out of the art direction. Genius! It is impossible for me to free my mind now from the images, which are startlingly fresh, in the way that "Letyat zhuravli" (The Cranes are Flying) was in 1957, or the opening shot of "Cleo de 5 a 7" was in 1962. The composition of every shot is immaculately precise in the manner of Jacques Tati's "Monsieur Hulot" movies, or Godard's "Une femme mariee" (1964) or the magazine industry, but Agnes Varda's movie is greater than all of these, because whereas those are static, motionless, almost feeling-less projects, hers has somehow managed to come across fluidly, effortlessly, vividly as anything before or after until the works of Kieslowski. It felt like I was watching a scene out of some family's life in heaven, and then, one of the children looks at the camera and offers some fruit, as if Varda is winking at us and saying, "Enjoy, come in. Be a part of our wonderful time." Can life really be so wonderful as it is in this movie? The movie goes on to probe that very question. And I am better for it.

    'Happiness' is the best translation of the title for this brilliant, sad but complete movie. I saw it when I was happily married and worked for a huge publishing company. Later in life I saw the other films made by Agnes Varda. They all were very deep and made me emotional. The scene of the suicide in 'Le Bonheur' is filmed as a kind of hidden action of a woman who did not understand that her husband had so much love to give. I still don't understand WHAT made this movie so unbelievably brilliant. Maybe I should buy a DVD if available. Love is the only gift that made me change in my whole behavour. If I had to choose between the best movie and the choice was limited to 'Citizen Kane' and 'Le Bonheur', the second one I mention would win. The beauty of the filming itself was great and rich in all aspects. Well, dear reader, I'm going to look for a DVD of 'Le Bonheur.

    Watching this film the last time, some 45 years ago, upon it's original UK release, I was blown away. I felt I had never seen such beautiful sunny summer images, I was astonished at the use of posters and advertising hoardings for composition. I notice now that some of these aspects have coloured my own photographic sensitivities. I remember the film as one long celebration of happiness and the suggestion that with the right attitude life would be like this. Seeing it again, it is still undoubtedly beautiful and I possibly appreciate even more the wonderful cinematography, however, now I notice how subversive this movie is. I have a feeling that this is very much a personal film seen through Varda's eyes and she is suggesting that a woman might easily do as the second woman does in this without causing so much as a head to turn. I think not, this is fantasy. The guy is unreal, men don't lie around saying how happy they are all the time, never mind the way he fails to be affected by the incident. I imagine at the time I saw this as a depiction of a real possibility. I seem to remember thinking lots of things were possible in the 60s that have turned out not to be. Nevertheless, this is still a beautiful movie,

    Fran&ccedil;ois leads an idyllic life full of happiness. He loves his wife and their young children; he enjoys his work as a carpenter; and the country town where he lives is awash with sunshine and smiling faces. So when he meets a pretty girl working at the post office, what could be more natural and right than to take a further sip from the bowl of happiness? Le Bonheur is a delicious sugar-coated bonbon with a bitter centre. What disturbs the viewer most is the cool unjudging gaze of Varda's camera: the characters are naive but not cruel, and when tragedy strikes it comes about from a childlike pursuit of happiness. Then the seasons change, and life continues with no-one wiser than before... The emphatic pastel colour palette of the film, and the music of Mozart that plays insistently throughout, are beautiful and cloyingly seductive. They entice us into the innocent fantasy world of Fran&ccedil;ois, where all it takes to do the right thing is to follow your desires. What could possibly go wrong? Le Bonheur is an exquisite, delicate, ambiguous masterpiece of the type that Hollywood was, is and always will be incapable of producing.

    The film divides fairly neatly into 4 20-minute sections, as we follow first the apparently very happy marriage of Fran&ccedil;ois and his wife Therese with their two small children; the beginnings of Fran&ccedil;ois' affair with &Eacute;milie; the growing intensity of that affair and his disclosure of it to Therese; and the aftermath. There's no way to properly discuss this without serious spoilers, so I hope anyone reading this has seen the film. Throughout the film the music of Mozart is used, specifically the Clarinet Quintet, much of it enormously cheerful and beautiful but with a melancholy undertone always struggling to break to the surface - and this describes the film as well. Each segment of the film is broken up by a day in the country as the family leaves the confines of their medium-sized provincial city - each segment (save the last) begins in a carefree, naive and innocent happiness and the exquisite photography romances both the beautiful couple with their children and the countryside. Nothing could be more gorgeous... But in fact Fran&ccedil;ois seems to suffer from an excess of happiness - he actually says as much at one point - or rather, he is incapable of feeling anything deep at all and experiences only a shallow surface thrill at the beauty of both his wife and his new love. He can't ever really decide between them and seems unable to grasp that he should even be thinking in that way, and that there might be problems developing as a result. I don't think it's any coincidence that &Eacute;milie bears a strong resemblance to Therese - blonde, roughly the same height and build, affecting fairly similar clothing and in the end, doubling in every way for her predecessor. Fran&ccedil;ois doesn't really want something different - he wants more of the same - or rather, he just wants to adore and be adored in a simple and childish way without thought of consequences. Perhaps it wouldn't matter if &Eacute;milie was strikingly different from Therese - but then perhaps it wouldn't be as obvious to us that all the man sees is the surface, and one surface seems as good as another... At the climax of the film, the end of the third part, Fran&ccedil;ois confesses his affair, and it's obvious that he has no comprehension that it could be a problem - he has enough love for both of them, you see. But Therese, perhaps as incapable as he is of truly adult comprehension or communication, nevertheless is capable of rejection, and she does so in dramatic and final fashion, forcing him to choose by removing herself from the equation. At the end, &Eacute;milie has replaced her in every way and the only person who has apparently learned anything is the one who ended her life. Varda deliberately creates a film that is all bold surfaces and colors - bright reds, pastel blues and greens, sunny yellows - and it is her use of color and editing that define the melancholy that underlies the happiness. When &Eacute;milie shows Fran&ccedil;ois her apartment for the first time there is a series of very quick cuts that show her possessions as Fran&ccedil;ois looks around, as if to show that in a few seconds he has taken in all he needs to, that he has found what he's looking for and doesn't need to think about it. And he never does. All three characters are fairly shallow, at least the film doesn't explicitly show us anything much to contradict that, and this leads to an extraordinarily cynical feeling, particularly on a second viewing for me - really, she seems to be saying, if we don't think and don't communicate with each other, if all we want is happiness, then what difference does it make if one person drowns herself - if that was her choice? One woman is as good as another, a new mother can do the same job as the original, let's just go on with our daily lives and forget about the darkness. The sole person who may have actually thought matters through with any understanding, Therese, is ultimately the one who can't exist in this world. It's also helpful in watching this I think - or at least, it gives the film even greater resonance - if one has seen "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg", made the previous year by Varda's husband Jacques Demy, which makes a fascinating counterpoint. Where "Le Bonheur" has the rhythmic feel and glossy surface of a musical, the Demy film actually is one; and where Varda's film actually ends up a tragedy - but wrapped up in cozy beauty - Demy's film is only a Hollywood tragedy. Did the wife make her savage piece of cynicism in response to her husband's bittersweet romance? I don't know, but it's fascinating to think about the many parallels... On the whole, I think "Le Bonheur" is one of the key French films of the 60s, it stands for me with the much-better known works of Godard, Truffaut and Chabrol from the decade and it is certainly a powerful philosophical statement about the nature of relationships, fidelity, "happiness."

    This is the first of Agnes Varda's works that I have seen and I have to first say that I was taken by the beauty that she puts into the picture. The use of color and the images she uses, how she frames them and the positioning of the camera in just the right spot...all of that create a beautiful picture that is just breathtaking. And the music (Mozart, I believe, though I am relatively unschooled in classical music) is wonderful and fits in to the picture perfectly. The story centers around Francois, a carpenter, his wife Claire, his children and his mistress, Emilie. The film begins with a beautiful buildup of an idyllic family life and a perfect marriage-too perfect in fact, and this probably reflects Francois' perception of reality and his delusions which continue throughout the film. They are a happy family with a great home life and frequent family trips to the country. Then Francois meets Emilie, a telegraph worker, with whom he also falls in love. He begins an affair with her, finding her to complement the relationship he has with his wife. And he believes that, because he is so happy with her and his love for his wife also seems to have grown with this affair, his wife will be happy with this state of affairs. And so he tells her, but the tragic results of that are not what he expects.. The story in part shows the naivety of people in love-even love where the participants shouldn't expect approval based on social norms. Lovers seem reluctant to believe that their love can hurt anyone or that anyone would wish their love to be otherwise. There is a selfishness about infatuation that throws up blinders around reality. Francois expects his wife to approve of the affair as he's totally wrapped up in his own feelings, a selfishness that is unconscious and unrecognized, so that he doesn't see the effect his betrayal might have on his partner. In fact, he doesn't even see it as betrayal. There is a fundamental inequality in his marriage, and Francois has mistaken his own feelings and desires for the communal feelings and desires that should be part of a truly idyllic marriage. Is such a relationship really possible? I don't know and Varda doesn't give us much hope, but it is clear that it is not possible if there is a fundamental selfishness and lack of respect in the partnership. This film developed a sense of unease within me, even in the early part and that just intensified throughout the movie as the plot and the affair deepened and Francois' apparent delusions of emotional reality became more evident. Though I didn't foresee the climax specifically, it was clear that things couldn't continue as blissfully as they appeared. The ending disturbed me most of all. This is a beautiful film and one that has many messages about relationships, marriage and society.

    A man in a happy marriage with two kids begins an affair, sincerely feeling he has enough love for both women and that neither one will be loved less. To start with, it's absolutely beautiful to look at. Varda always seems to know exactly what to do with the image, where to put the camera, which direction to move, when to cut, what color to fade to; everything is absolutely perfect. Moreover, the film is completely fascinating first because Varda deals with her subject with a rare honesty and forgiveness. Not a single character is unlikeable. Even if you see error in the husband's thinking, it is clear he believes with all of his heart that he truly can love both of these women at once and you sympathize with his sincerity. The wife is easy to care for, a good mother and very devoted, and the mistress is not someone you feel compelled to hate, either. She's not out to break up this marriage and she seems to really need this love. And what makes the film endlessly interesting is in how ambiguous Varda is about her own feelings. She never leads you to pick a side, never encourages you to see one specific viewpoint or leave the film feeling a particular way about what happened. While the music (Mozart is used throughout most of the film) in the last 15 minutes would seem to suggest anger at the way things have turned out, you can also look at the early stages of the film and see the image of the idyllic family with pastoral music as too perfect a presentation, one that is not entirely believable. Varda even hints at this herself; after we've watched about five minutes of this family picnicking in the woods, she cuts almost immediately to nearly the same image in a TV advertisement, suggesting that a marriage that happy only exists in commercials to begin with.
