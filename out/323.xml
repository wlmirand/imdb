    This movie really takes you on a wild ride. It starts out with a very action-packed sequence in which the lead character (Brosnan) is fleeing with a town to outrun a volcanic eruption. The film then does a flash- forward in which Brosnan is asked to take a look around Dante's Peak, a dormant volcano that has shown recent activity. Events soon unfold foreshadowing a disastrous end for the town and its residents. I have not seen too many disaster movies, but this one does what I think they all set out to do: keep you on the edge of your seat. It contains a great deal of peril, so I don't think viewers will be disappointed on that front. The directors did a good job of making sure this movie isn't a sleeper, which it well could have been!

    A solid but unremarkable disaster movie. Pierce Brosnan arrives in the town of Dante's Peak and predicts the imminent eruption of their supposedly dormant volcano, but will the city council believe him? If you've seen 'Jaws', 'Earthquake', 'The Towering Inferno', 'Gremlins' or 'The Blob' you'll know the answer to that one, and so in due course the special effects department takes over and pours smoke, ash and molten lava all over the place. The story and characterisation take a back seat to the impressive destruction of the town, which means logic occasionally gets swept away in the lava flow, but there are some refreshingly gruesome moments and the whole thing has a certain old-fashioned charm.

    Dante's Peak is a little unknown, very fine film. Pierce Brosnan is Dr. Harry Dalton, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, who's sent to the small town in Washington within the Northern Cascades named Dante's Peak, the second most desirable place to live in the United States population under 20,000, to check on a long time dormant volcano that's about to erupt. Linda Hamilton is Rachel Wando, the mayor of Dante's Peak, who's taken with Dr. Dalton and keeps close by. Hamilton and Brosnan have very interesting, very authentic chemistry that makes Dante's Peak more than worth while. Brosnan and Hamilton is the movie's main sight, while the volcano of Dante's Peak is the movie's main attraction. The ever-present brewing volcano provides the ominous backdrop to the storyline implanting constant tension. There's no action or effects until the volcano erupts, but when it does, there's loads of it. Dante's Peak turns into an all out action-adventure with great set effects for large scale destruction. The presentation of the special effects is very well done. The movie is good before the volcano erupts still, by having a nice, hang around vibe and pace, good not to rush things. Dante's Peak's prolonged pace is difficult to achieve, but it is executed well. The film does a solid job of incorporating the characters onto the viewing. Dante's Peak has good camera direction from the start up and through to the action-packed finish that makes for an overall great visual experience. It's a well-framed story. I don't know what all else to say other than this is a really liked film without too many complaints. I give Dante's Peak a 6 for it being so greatly appealing and such fine, family fun. I can enjoy this movie dearly again and again every so many years. I like Volcano more, from the same year, but Dante's Peak is a better movie.

    always fascinated with Volcanoes ever since I got ashes from Mt. St. Helens from my uncle as a kid, this is a really good story about a long dormant volcano. or so we think.. a young couple pay the price for getting it on in the Hot Springs, squirrels start dying,, and the mountain starts to heat up a bit,, water starts to boil,, I really love the pyroclastic flow in the movie,, wow just watching all that was pretty cool,, Linda Hamilton is gorgeous as ever , and she did a great job acting as well.. Pierce Brosnan seems very credible in his role as a Geologist. the team arrives to check out the mountain and good thing because it's getting ready to blow it's top,, the town is named 2nd best place to live,, population under 20000. a real estate magnate wants to invest heavily in the town. our geologist s boss however doesn't wanna put the town on alert because the town could suffer financial instability and go broke if all the tourists leave and the money man decides to leave town,, he will have to live with that decision.... excellent movie,, lot's of lava,, some improbable things like , can you drive on it,, apparently so,,, it the lake turning to acid,, no I thought that was pretty cool,,

    i watched this movie in school and our class had to review it for homework we watched because we were doing a topic on volcanoes the weaknesses were the unrealistic lava the granny in the lake the bridge looked like it was a toy modal bridge the crater robot broken LOL .the pick up truck driving thorough hot lava the granny in the water and instead of romance more action and explosions there is really bad graphics and bad effects. if i was making a movie i would change the romance i would recommend it to others because other year 10 pupils and geography teachers because it their doing topic about volcanoes and it would show them what happens when a volcano explodes and erupted

    I though this movie was really good! It was full of suspense at the start and end. There was some gory scenes like broken bones, blood etc. This was a bad point because my friends are squeamish. The best part of the movie was the end, when the volcano started erupting because I love action. There was a lot of people at risk during the eruption, pyroclastic clouds and the lava, there was also a dead couple floating in the Hot Spring. I think overall they could have added more action, less love and more humour otherwise this movie was brilliant! Pierce Brosnan as Harry Dalton and Linda Hamilton as Rachel Wando both developed a good bond throughout the movie and ended it with a romantic kiss. Harry Dalton is an expert vulcanologist that tries to persuade his work partners that there is something going on and the town has to be put on alert but Paul (boss) refuses to do so until there is more information and mother have a massive part in the movie although Ruth (mother) has her leg burnt off and she dies I would recommend this movie to teenagers and action movie lovers!

    We watched this movie in our Geography class and it was certainly worth watching. The Strengths of the movie would be the special effects of the Pyroclastic cloud and lava, the plot was very tense at times making us want to watch on and the cast were very good. The weaknesses of the movie though was that it was unrealistic at times, like, it lava was coming through your house, you would pretty much die by the heat etc. The Love relationship between Harry and Rachel didn't really go anywhere. Overall i though it was a very good film and would recommend to anyone studying volcanoes.

    I liked this movie and I think it had many strengths but also some weaknesses. The effects were usually fantastic, especially considering that the movie was made 16 years ago. The movie followed a good storyline but I found that it was too predictable (e.g Harry was right about the volcano, although there was no proof.) Many parts of the movie were unrealistic like when the boat eroded away so quickly that Ruth had to sacrifice herself to get it across the river but their dog had somehow got across with no problems. I enjoyed how this movie had romance and occasional humor (coffee scene), after watching Harry's girlfriend's tragic death I was pleased the movie ended happily. Dant&eacute;'s Peak helped me understand more about volcanoes although I feel they could have added more detail/attention to this aspect of the movie. Overall I enjoyed this movie. I feel it educated and entertained me from start to finish.

    Dante's Peak is a brilliant movie that is good for any 14 and up who are studying volcano's as the special effects of a movie over 10 years old are very good. Although the movie is very good it has a bit to much romance for me. It is has bits of humor throughout the movie such as "coffee,my favorite time of day". Some bits of the movie don't add up such as how the dog got over the lake when it was acid or how the grandmother didn't die instantly in the acid lake. Some of the ways I would improve the movie would be put some more action and be a bit more realistic. Some of the reasons this movie is good to go to if your are studying volcano's is because they're is plenty of volcanic words such as pyroctast which is a ash cloud.

    This film is about a volcano Mt St Helen's erupting killing people and destroying a small town (Dante's Peak) below it. The main characters are Pierce Brosnan the volcanologist and Linda Hamilton the Mayor of Dante's Peak. There is a good build up throughout the movie, getting to know all the characters and seeing their relationships develop before the disaster happens. The movie has many strengths. It appears to be scientifically accurate about the behavior of a volcano and how unpredictable it can be and the devastation it can cause. The scenery is stunning and the special effects are awesome. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and you can believe every characters situation. It has a few weaknesses. A bit unbelievable that the young boy could drive a van up the mountain when his feet couldn't touch the pedals! Also trying to outrun the pyroclastic flow, I think you would be in pieces. Most unbelievable scene was driving the car through lava, very entertaining - lava can reach 2000 degrees, don't think there would have been any signs of the car left. Don't care about that I loved it. I would give the movie 8.5 out of 10. It really gave me an interest in volcano's and how they work. It showed how people might react against such a treat in their town and how the town's council would try and play it down hoping it wouldn't happen. I don't think they could have improved it, there was action, a love story, fantastic special effects and you learnt about volcano's as well. A bit soppy in places, but hey it's the movies.

The presentation of the special effects is very well done. The movie is good before the volcano erupts still, by having a nice, hang around vibe and pace, good not to rush things. Dante's Peak's prolonged pace is difficult to achieve, but it is executed well. The film does a solid job of incorporating the characters onto the viewing. Dante's Peak has good camera direction from the start up and through to the action-packed finish that makes for an overall great visual experience. It's a well-framed story. I don't know what all else to say other than this is a really liked film without too many complaints. I give Dante's Peak a 6 for it being so greatly appealing and such fine, family fun. I can enjoy this movie dearly again and again every so many years. I like Volcano more, from the same year, but Dante's Peak is a better movie.

    always fascinated with Volcanoes ever since I got ashes from Mt. St. Helens from my uncle as a kid, this is a really good story about a long dormant volcano. or so we think.. a young couple pay the price for getting it on in the Hot Springs, squirrels start dying,, and the mountain starts to heat up a bit,, water starts to boil,, I really love the pyroclastic flow in the movie,, wow just watching all that was pretty cool,, Linda Hamilton is gorgeous as ever , and she did a great job acting as well.. Pierce Brosnan seems very credible in his role as a Geologist. the team arrives to check out the mountain and good thing because it's getting ready to blow it's top,, the town is named 2nd best place to live,, population under 20000. a real estate magnate wants to invest heavily in the town. our geologist s boss however doesn't wanna put the town on alert because the town could suffer financial instability and go broke if all the tourists leave and the money man decides to leave town,, he will have to live with that decision.... excellent movie,, lot's of lava,, some improbable things like , can you drive on it,, apparently so,,, it the lake turning to acid,, no I thought that was pretty cool,,

    i watched this movie in school and our class had to review it for homework we watched because we were doing a topic on volcanoes the weaknesses were the unrealistic lava the granny in the lake the bridge looked like it was a toy modal bridge the crater robot broken LOL .the pick up truck driving thorough hot lava the granny in the water and instead of romance more action and explosions there is really bad graphics and bad effects. if i was making a movie i would change the romance i would recommend it to others because other year 10 pupils and geography teachers because it their doing topic about volcanoes and it would show them what happens when a volcano explodes and erupted

    I though this movie was really good! It was full of suspense at the start and end. There was some gory scenes like broken bones, blood etc. This was a bad point because my friends are squeamish. The best part of the movie was the end, when the volcano started erupting because I love action. There was a lot of people at risk during the eruption, pyroclastic clouds and the lava, there was also a dead couple floating in the Hot Spring. I think overall they could have added more action, less love and more humour otherwise this movie was brilliant! Pierce Brosnan as Harry Dalton and Linda Hamilton as Rachel Wando both developed a good bond throughout the movie and ended it with a romantic kiss. Harry Dalton is an expert vulcanologist that tries to persuade his work partners that there is something going on and the town has to be put on alert but Paul (boss) refuses to do so until there is more information and mother have a massive part in the movie although Ruth (mother) has her leg burnt off and she dies I would recommend this movie to teenagers and action movie lovers!

    We watched this movie in our Geography class and it was certainly worth watching. The Strengths of the movie would be the special effects of the Pyroclastic cloud and lava, the plot was very tense at times making us want to watch on and the cast were very good. The weaknesses of the movie though was that it was unrealistic at times, like, it lava was coming through your house, you would pretty much die by the heat etc. The Love relationship between Harry and Rachel didn't really go anywhere. Overall i though it was a very good film and would recommend to anyone studying volcanoes.

    I liked this movie and I think it had many strengths but also some weaknesses. The effects were usually fantastic, especially considering that the movie was made 16 years ago. The movie followed a good storyline but I found that it was too predictable (e.g Harry was right about the volcano, although there was no proof.) Many parts of the movie were unrealistic like when the boat eroded away so quickly that Ruth had to sacrifice herself to get it across the river but their dog had somehow got across with no problems. I enjoyed how this movie had romance and occasional humor (coffee scene), after watching Harry's girlfriend's tragic death I was pleased the movie ended happily. Dant&eacute;'s Peak helped me understand more about volcanoes although I feel they could have added more detail/attention to this aspect of the movie. Overall I enjoyed this movie. I feel it educated and entertained me from start to finish.

    Dante's Peak is a brilliant movie that is good for any 14 and up who are studying volcano's as the special effects of a movie over 10 years old are very good. Although the movie is very good it has a bit to much romance for me. It is has bits of humor throughout the movie such as "coffee,my favorite time of day". Some bits of the movie don't add up such as how the dog got over the lake when it was acid or how the grandmother didn't die instantly in the acid lake. Some of the ways I would improve the movie would be put some more action and be a bit more realistic. Some of the reasons this movie is good to go to if your are studying volcano's is because they're is plenty of volcanic words such as pyroctast which is a ash cloud.

    This film is about a volcano Mt St Helen's erupting killing people and destroying a small town (Dante's Peak) below it. The main characters are Pierce Brosnan the volcanologist and Linda Hamilton the Mayor of Dante's Peak. There is a good build up throughout the movie, getting to know all the characters and seeing their relationships develop before the disaster happens. The movie has many strengths. It appears to be scientifically accurate about the behavior of a volcano and how unpredictable it can be and the devastation it can cause. The scenery is stunning and the special effects are awesome. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and you can believe every characters situation. It has a few weaknesses. A bit unbelievable that the young boy could drive a van up the mountain when his feet couldn't touch the pedals! Also trying to outrun the pyroclastic flow, I think you would be in pieces. Most unbelievable scene was driving the car through lava, very entertaining - lava can reach 2000 degrees, don't think there would have been any signs of the car left. Don't care about that I loved it. I would give the movie 8.5 out of 10. It really gave me an interest in volcano's and how they work. It showed how people might react against such a treat in their town and how the town's council would try and play it down hoping it wouldn't happen. I don't think they could have improved it, there was action, a love story, fantastic special effects and you learnt about volcano's as well. A bit soppy in places, but hey it's the movies.

    This movie really takes you on a wild ride. It starts out with a very action-packed sequence in which the lead character (Brosnan) is fleeing with a town to outrun a volcanic eruption. The film then does a flash- forward in which Brosnan is asked to take a look around Dante's Peak, a dormant volcano that has shown recent activity. Events soon unfold foreshadowing a disastrous end for the town and its residents. I have not seen too many disaster movies, but this one does what I think they all set out to do: keep you on the edge of your seat. It contains a great deal of peril, so I don't think viewers will be disappointed on that front. The directors did a good job of making sure this movie isn't a sleeper, which it well could have been!

    A solid but unremarkable disaster movie. Pierce Brosnan arrives in the town of Dante's Peak and predicts the imminent eruption of their supposedly dormant volcano, but will the city council believe him? If you've seen 'Jaws', 'Earthquake', 'The Towering Inferno', 'Gremlins' or 'The Blob' you'll know the answer to that one, and so in due course the special effects department takes over and pours smoke, ash and molten lava all over the place. The story and characterisation take a back seat to the impressive destruction of the town, which means logic occasionally gets swept away in the lava flow, but there are some refreshingly gruesome moments and the whole thing has a certain old-fashioned charm.

    Dante's Peak is a little unknown, very fine film. Pierce Brosnan is Dr. Harry Dalton, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, who's sent to the small town in Washington within the Northern Cascades named Dante's Peak, the second most desirable place to live in the United States population under 20,000, to check on a long time dormant volcano that's about to erupt. Linda Hamilton is Rachel Wando, the mayor of Dante's Peak, who's taken with Dr. Dalton and keeps close by. Hamilton and Brosnan have very interesting, very authentic chemistry that makes Dante's Peak more than worth while. Brosnan and Hamilton is the movie's main sight, while the volcano of Dante's Peak is the movie's main attraction. The ever-present brewing volcano provides the ominous backdrop to the storyline implanting constant tension. There's no action or effects until the volcano erupts, but when it does, there's loads of it. Dante's Peak turns into an all out action-adventure with great set effects for large scale destruction. The presentation of the special effects is very well done. The movie is good before the volcano erupts still, by having a nice, hang around vibe and pace, good not to rush things. Dante's Peak's prolonged pace is difficult to achieve, but it is executed well. The film does a solid job of incorporating the characters onto the viewing. Dante's Peak has good camera direction from the start up and through to the action-packed finish that makes for an overall great visual experience. It's a well-framed story. I don't know what all else to say other than this is a really liked film without too many complaints. I give Dante's Peak a 6 for it being so greatly appealing and such fine, family fun. I can enjoy this movie dearly again and again every so many years. I like Volcano more, from the same year, but Dante's Peak is a better movie.

Overall i though it was a very good film and would recommend to anyone studying volcanoes.

    I liked this movie and I think it had many strengths but also some weaknesses. The effects were usually fantastic, especially considering that the movie was made 16 years ago. The movie followed a good storyline but I found that it was too predictable (e.g Harry was right about the volcano, although there was no proof.) Many parts of the movie were unrealistic like when the boat eroded away so quickly that Ruth had to sacrifice herself to get it across the river but their dog had somehow got across with no problems. I enjoyed how this movie had romance and occasional humor (coffee scene), after watching Harry's girlfriend's tragic death I was pleased the movie ended happily. Dant&eacute;'s Peak helped me understand more about volcanoes although I feel they could have added more detail/attention to this aspect of the movie. Overall I enjoyed this movie. I feel it educated and entertained me from start to finish.

    Dante's Peak is a brilliant movie that is good for any 14 and up who are studying volcano's as the special effects of a movie over 10 years old are very good. Although the movie is very good it has a bit to much romance for me. It is has bits of humor throughout the movie such as "coffee,my favorite time of day". Some bits of the movie don't add up such as how the dog got over the lake when it was acid or how the grandmother didn't die instantly in the acid lake. Some of the ways I would improve the movie would be put some more action and be a bit more realistic. Some of the reasons this movie is good to go to if your are studying volcano's is because they're is plenty of volcanic words such as pyroctast which is a ash cloud.

    This film is about a volcano Mt St Helen's erupting killing people and destroying a small town (Dante's Peak) below it. The main characters are Pierce Brosnan the volcanologist and Linda Hamilton the Mayor of Dante's Peak. There is a good build up throughout the movie, getting to know all the characters and seeing their relationships develop before the disaster happens. The movie has many strengths. It appears to be scientifically accurate about the behavior of a volcano and how unpredictable it can be and the devastation it can cause. The scenery is stunning and the special effects are awesome. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and you can believe every characters situation. It has a few weaknesses. A bit unbelievable that the young boy could drive a van up the mountain when his feet couldn't touch the pedals! Also trying to outrun the pyroclastic flow, I think you would be in pieces. Most unbelievable scene was driving the car through lava, very entertaining - lava can reach 2000 degrees, don't think there would have been any signs of the car left. Don't care about that I loved it. I would give the movie 8.5 out of 10. It really gave me an interest in volcano's and how they work. It showed how people might react against such a treat in their town and how the town's council would try and play it down hoping it wouldn't happen. I don't think they could have improved it, there was action, a love story, fantastic special effects and you learnt about volcano's as well. A bit soppy in places, but hey it's the movies.

    This movie really takes you on a wild ride. It starts out with a very action-packed sequence in which the lead character (Brosnan) is fleeing with a town to outrun a volcanic eruption. The film then does a flash- forward in which Brosnan is asked to take a look around Dante's Peak, a dormant volcano that has shown recent activity. Events soon unfold foreshadowing a disastrous end for the town and its residents. I have not seen too many disaster movies, but this one does what I think they all set out to do: keep you on the edge of your seat. It contains a great deal of peril, so I don't think viewers will be disappointed on that front. The directors did a good job of making sure this movie isn't a sleeper, which it well could have been!

    A solid but unremarkable disaster movie. Pierce Brosnan arrives in the town of Dante's Peak and predicts the imminent eruption of their supposedly dormant volcano, but will the city council believe him? If you've seen 'Jaws', 'Earthquake', 'The Towering Inferno', 'Gremlins' or 'The Blob' you'll know the answer to that one, and so in due course the special effects department takes over and pours smoke, ash and molten lava all over the place. The story and characterisation take a back seat to the impressive destruction of the town, which means logic occasionally gets swept away in the lava flow, but there are some refreshingly gruesome moments and the whole thing has a certain old-fashioned charm.

    Dante's Peak is a little unknown, very fine film. Pierce Brosnan is Dr. Harry Dalton, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, who's sent to the small town in Washington within the Northern Cascades named Dante's Peak, the second most desirable place to live in the United States population under 20,000, to check on a long time dormant volcano that's about to erupt. Linda Hamilton is Rachel Wando, the mayor of Dante's Peak, who's taken with Dr. Dalton and keeps close by. Hamilton and Brosnan have very interesting, very authentic chemistry that makes Dante's Peak more than worth while. Brosnan and Hamilton is the movie's main sight, while the volcano of Dante's Peak is the movie's main attraction. The ever-present brewing volcano provides the ominous backdrop to the storyline implanting constant tension. There's no action or effects until the volcano erupts, but when it does, there's loads of it. Dante's Peak turns into an all out action-adventure with great set effects for large scale destruction. The presentation of the special effects is very well done. The movie is good before the volcano erupts still, by having a nice, hang around vibe and pace, good not to rush things. Dante's Peak's prolonged pace is difficult to achieve, but it is executed well. The film does a solid job of incorporating the characters onto the viewing. Dante's Peak has good camera direction from the start up and through to the action-packed finish that makes for an overall great visual experience. It's a well-framed story. I don't know what all else to say other than this is a really liked film without too many complaints. I give Dante's Peak a 6 for it being so greatly appealing and such fine, family fun. I can enjoy this movie dearly again and again every so many years. I like Volcano more, from the same year, but Dante's Peak is a better movie.

    always fascinated with Volcanoes ever since I got ashes from Mt. St. Helens from my uncle as a kid, this is a really good story about a long dormant volcano. or so we think.. a young couple pay the price for getting it on in the Hot Springs, squirrels start dying,, and the mountain starts to heat up a bit,, water starts to boil,, I really love the pyroclastic flow in the movie,, wow just watching all that was pretty cool,, Linda Hamilton is gorgeous as ever , and she did a great job acting as well.. Pierce Brosnan seems very credible in his role as a Geologist. the team arrives to check out the mountain and good thing because it's getting ready to blow it's top,, the town is named 2nd best place to live,, population under 20000. a real estate magnate wants to invest heavily in the town. our geologist s boss however doesn't wanna put the town on alert because the town could suffer financial instability and go broke if all the tourists leave and the money man decides to leave town,, he will have to live with that decision.... excellent movie,, lot's of lava,, some improbable things like , can you drive on it,, apparently so,,, it the lake turning to acid,, no I thought that was pretty cool,,

    I though this movie was really good! It was full of suspense at the start and end. There was some gory scenes like broken bones, blood etc. This was a bad point because my friends are squeamish. The best part of the movie was the end, when the volcano started erupting because I love action. There was a lot of people at risk during the eruption, pyroclastic clouds and the lava, there was also a dead couple floating in the Hot Spring. I think overall they could have added more action, less love and more humour otherwise this movie was brilliant! Pierce Brosnan as Harry Dalton and Linda Hamilton as Rachel Wando both developed a good bond throughout the movie and ended it with a romantic kiss. Harry Dalton is an expert vulcanologist that tries to persuade his work partners that there is something going on and the town has to be put on alert but Paul (boss) refuses to do so until there is more information and mother have a massive part in the movie although Ruth (mother) has her leg burnt off and she dies I would recommend this movie to teenagers and action movie lovers!

It contains a great deal of peril, so I don't think viewers will be disappointed on that front. The directors did a good job of making sure this movie isn't a sleeper, which it well could have been!

    A solid but unremarkable disaster movie. Pierce Brosnan arrives in the town of Dante's Peak and predicts the imminent eruption of their supposedly dormant volcano, but will the city council believe him? If you've seen 'Jaws', 'Earthquake', 'The Towering Inferno', 'Gremlins' or 'The Blob' you'll know the answer to that one, and so in due course the special effects department takes over and pours smoke, ash and molten lava all over the place. The story and characterisation take a back seat to the impressive destruction of the town, which means logic occasionally gets swept away in the lava flow, but there are some refreshingly gruesome moments and the whole thing has a certain old-fashioned charm.

    Dante's Peak is a little unknown, very fine film. Pierce Brosnan is Dr. Harry Dalton, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, who's sent to the small town in Washington within the Northern Cascades named Dante's Peak, the second most desirable place to live in the United States population under 20,000, to check on a long time dormant volcano that's about to erupt. Linda Hamilton is Rachel Wando, the mayor of Dante's Peak, who's taken with Dr. Dalton and keeps close by. Hamilton and Brosnan have very interesting, very authentic chemistry that makes Dante's Peak more than worth while. Brosnan and Hamilton is the movie's main sight, while the volcano of Dante's Peak is the movie's main attraction. The ever-present brewing volcano provides the ominous backdrop to the storyline implanting constant tension. There's no action or effects until the volcano erupts, but when it does, there's loads of it. Dante's Peak turns into an all out action-adventure with great set effects for large scale destruction. The presentation of the special effects is very well done. The movie is good before the volcano erupts still, by having a nice, hang around vibe and pace, good not to rush things. Dante's Peak's prolonged pace is difficult to achieve, but it is executed well. The film does a solid job of incorporating the characters onto the viewing. Dante's Peak has good camera direction from the start up and through to the action-packed finish that makes for an overall great visual experience. It's a well-framed story. I don't know what all else to say other than this is a really liked film without too many complaints. I give Dante's Peak a 6 for it being so greatly appealing and such fine, family fun. I can enjoy this movie dearly again and again every so many years. I like Volcano more, from the same year, but Dante's Peak is a better movie.

    always fascinated with Volcanoes ever since I got ashes from Mt. St. Helens from my uncle as a kid, this is a really good story about a long dormant volcano. or so we think.. a young couple pay the price for getting it on in the Hot Springs, squirrels start dying,, and the mountain starts to heat up a bit,, water starts to boil,, I really love the pyroclastic flow in the movie,, wow just watching all that was pretty cool,, Linda Hamilton is gorgeous as ever , and she did a great job acting as well.. Pierce Brosnan seems very credible in his role as a Geologist. the team arrives to check out the mountain and good thing because it's getting ready to blow it's top,, the town is named 2nd best place to live,, population under 20000. a real estate magnate wants to invest heavily in the town. our geologist s boss however doesn't wanna put the town on alert because the town could suffer financial instability and go broke if all the tourists leave and the money man decides to leave town,, he will have to live with that decision.... excellent movie,, lot's of lava,, some improbable things like , can you drive on it,, apparently so,,, it the lake turning to acid,, no I thought that was pretty cool,,

    i watched this movie in school and our class had to review it for homework we watched because we were doing a topic on volcanoes the weaknesses were the unrealistic lava the granny in the lake the bridge looked like it was a toy modal bridge the crater robot broken LOL .the pick up truck driving thorough hot lava the granny in the water and instead of romance more action and explosions there is really bad graphics and bad effects. if i was making a movie i would change the romance i would recommend it to others because other year 10 pupils and geography teachers because it their doing topic about volcanoes and it would show them what happens when a volcano explodes and erupted

    I though this movie was really good! It was full of suspense at the start and end. There was some gory scenes like broken bones, blood etc. This was a bad point because my friends are squeamish. The best part of the movie was the end, when the volcano started erupting because I love action. There was a lot of people at risk during the eruption, pyroclastic clouds and the lava, there was also a dead couple floating in the Hot Spring. I think overall they could have added more action, less love and more humour otherwise this movie was brilliant! Pierce Brosnan as Harry Dalton and Linda Hamilton as Rachel Wando both developed a good bond throughout the movie and ended it with a romantic kiss. Harry Dalton is an expert vulcanologist that tries to persuade his work partners that there is something going on and the town has to be put on alert but Paul (boss) refuses to do so until there is more information and mother have a massive part in the movie although Ruth (mother) has her leg burnt off and she dies I would recommend this movie to teenagers and action movie lovers!

    We watched this movie in our Geography class and it was certainly worth watching. The Strengths of the movie would be the special effects of the Pyroclastic cloud and lava, the plot was very tense at times making us want to watch on and the cast were very good. The weaknesses of the movie though was that it was unrealistic at times, like, it lava was coming through your house, you would pretty much die by the heat etc. The Love relationship between Harry and Rachel didn't really go anywhere. Overall i though it was a very good film and would recommend to anyone studying volcanoes.

    I liked this movie and I think it had many strengths but also some weaknesses. The effects were usually fantastic, especially considering that the movie was made 16 years ago. The movie followed a good storyline but I found that it was too predictable (e.g Harry was right about the volcano, although there was no proof.) Many parts of the movie were unrealistic like when the boat eroded away so quickly that Ruth had to sacrifice herself to get it across the river but their dog had somehow got across with no problems. I enjoyed how this movie had romance and occasional humor (coffee scene), after watching Harry's girlfriend's tragic death I was pleased the movie ended happily. Dant&eacute;'s Peak helped me understand more about volcanoes although I feel they could have added more detail/attention to this aspect of the movie. Overall I enjoyed this movie. I feel it educated and entertained me from start to finish.

    Dante's Peak is a brilliant movie that is good for any 14 and up who are studying volcano's as the special effects of a movie over 10 years old are very good. Although the movie is very good it has a bit to much romance for me. It is has bits of humor throughout the movie such as "coffee,my favorite time of day". Some bits of the movie don't add up such as how the dog got over the lake when it was acid or how the grandmother didn't die instantly in the acid lake. Some of the ways I would improve the movie would be put some more action and be a bit more realistic. Some of the reasons this movie is good to go to if your are studying volcano's is because they're is plenty of volcanic words such as pyroctast which is a ash cloud.

    This film is about a volcano Mt St Helen's erupting killing people and destroying a small town (Dante's Peak) below it. The main characters are Pierce Brosnan the volcanologist and Linda Hamilton the Mayor of Dante's Peak. There is a good build up throughout the movie, getting to know all the characters and seeing their relationships develop before the disaster happens. The movie has many strengths. It appears to be scientifically accurate about the behavior of a volcano and how unpredictable it can be and the devastation it can cause. The scenery is stunning and the special effects are awesome. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and you can believe every characters situation. It has a few weaknesses. A bit unbelievable that the young boy could drive a van up the mountain when his feet couldn't touch the pedals! Also trying to outrun the pyroclastic flow, I think you would be in pieces. Most unbelievable scene was driving the car through lava, very entertaining - lava can reach 2000 degrees, don't think there would have been any signs of the car left. Don't care about that I loved it. I would give the movie 8.5 out of 10. It really gave me an interest in volcano's and how they work. It showed how people might react against such a treat in their town and how the town's council would try and play it down hoping it wouldn't happen. I don't think they could have improved it, there was action, a love story, fantastic special effects and you learnt about volcano's as well. A bit soppy in places, but hey it's the movies.

    This movie really takes you on a wild ride. It starts out with a very action-packed sequence in which the lead character (Brosnan) is fleeing with a town to outrun a volcanic eruption. The film then does a flash- forward in which Brosnan is asked to take a look around Dante's Peak, a dormant volcano that has shown recent activity. Events soon unfold foreshadowing a disastrous end for the town and its residents. I have not seen too many disaster movies, but this one does what I think they all set out to do: keep you on the edge of your seat. It contains a great deal of peril, so I don't think viewers will be disappointed on that front. The directors did a good job of making sure this movie isn't a sleeper, which it well could have been!

    i watched this movie in school and our class had to review it for homework we watched because we were doing a topic on volcanoes the weaknesses were the unrealistic lava the granny in the lake the bridge looked like it was a toy modal bridge the crater robot broken LOL .the pick up truck driving thorough hot lava the granny in the water and instead of romance more action and explosions there is really bad graphics and bad effects. if i was making a movie i would change the romance i would recommend it to others because other year 10 pupils and geography teachers because it their doing topic about volcanoes and it would show them what happens when a volcano explodes and erupted

    I though this movie was really good! It was full of suspense at the start and end. There was some gory scenes like broken bones, blood etc. This was a bad point because my friends are squeamish. The best part of the movie was the end, when the volcano started erupting because I love action. There was a lot of people at risk during the eruption, pyroclastic clouds and the lava, there was also a dead couple floating in the Hot Spring. I think overall they could have added more action, less love and more humour otherwise this movie was brilliant! Pierce Brosnan as Harry Dalton and Linda Hamilton as Rachel Wando both developed a good bond throughout the movie and ended it with a romantic kiss. Harry Dalton is an expert vulcanologist that tries to persuade his work partners that there is something going on and the town has to be put on alert but Paul (boss) refuses to do so until there is more information and mother have a massive part in the movie although Ruth (mother) has her leg burnt off and she dies I would recommend this movie to teenagers and action movie lovers!

    We watched this movie in our Geography class and it was certainly worth watching. The Strengths of the movie would be the special effects of the Pyroclastic cloud and lava, the plot was very tense at times making us want to watch on and the cast were very good. The weaknesses of the movie though was that it was unrealistic at times, like, it lava was coming through your house, you would pretty much die by the heat etc. The Love relationship between Harry and Rachel didn't really go anywhere. Overall i though it was a very good film and would recommend to anyone studying volcanoes.

    I liked this movie and I think it had many strengths but also some weaknesses. The effects were usually fantastic, especially considering that the movie was made 16 years ago. The movie followed a good storyline but I found that it was too predictable (e.g Harry was right about the volcano, although there was no proof.) Many parts of the movie were unrealistic like when the boat eroded away so quickly that Ruth had to sacrifice herself to get it across the river but their dog had somehow got across with no problems. I enjoyed how this movie had romance and occasional humor (coffee scene), after watching Harry's girlfriend's tragic death I was pleased the movie ended happily. Dant&eacute;'s Peak helped me understand more about volcanoes although I feel they could have added more detail/attention to this aspect of the movie. Overall I enjoyed this movie. I feel it educated and entertained me from start to finish.

    Dante's Peak is a brilliant movie that is good for any 14 and up who are studying volcano's as the special effects of a movie over 10 years old are very good. Although the movie is very good it has a bit to much romance for me. It is has bits of humor throughout the movie such as "coffee,my favorite time of day". Some bits of the movie don't add up such as how the dog got over the lake when it was acid or how the grandmother didn't die instantly in the acid lake. Some of the ways I would improve the movie would be put some more action and be a bit more realistic. Some of the reasons this movie is good to go to if your are studying volcano's is because they're is plenty of volcanic words such as pyroctast which is a ash cloud.

    This film is about a volcano Mt St Helen's erupting killing people and destroying a small town (Dante's Peak) below it. The main characters are Pierce Brosnan the volcanologist and Linda Hamilton the Mayor of Dante's Peak. There is a good build up throughout the movie, getting to know all the characters and seeing their relationships develop before the disaster happens. The movie has many strengths. It appears to be scientifically accurate about the behavior of a volcano and how unpredictable it can be and the devastation it can cause. The scenery is stunning and the special effects are awesome. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and you can believe every characters situation. It has a few weaknesses. A bit unbelievable that the young boy could drive a van up the mountain when his feet couldn't touch the pedals! Also trying to outrun the pyroclastic flow, I think you would be in pieces. Most unbelievable scene was driving the car through lava, very entertaining - lava can reach 2000 degrees, don't think there would have been any signs of the car left. Don't care about that I loved it. I would give the movie 8.5 out of 10. It really gave me an interest in volcano's and how they work. It showed how people might react against such a treat in their town and how the town's council would try and play it down hoping it wouldn't happen. I don't think they could have improved it, there was action, a love story, fantastic special effects and you learnt about volcano's as well. A bit soppy in places, but hey it's the movies.
