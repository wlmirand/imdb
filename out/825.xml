    Charlie Sheen plays Zane, a radio astronomer who accidentally discovers an alien signal from space, that also has origins on Earth. When he tries to tell his boss(Ron Silver, very good) he downplays and denies the importance of the find. Zane then finds out he has been fired, and the tape he gave to his boss disappears, so now very suspicious, he undertakes his own investigation, which leads him to an alarming truth about aliens who are indeed very much among us... Well written and directed by David Twohy, this science fiction film is a pleasant surprise, and Charlie Sheen is appealing and believable as the man determined to find the truth, and warn the world; sounds like a certain FBI agent from "The X-Files"...

    No spoilers...ever... It's a really fun movie with a cast that did a fine job of making it feel right. Is that the acting of the directing? Who freaking cares, it's fun. While there are a handful of what could be 'action' scenes it is the characters and plot itself which made this a fun watch to me. I won't do the spoiler thing but if you want a bit more thinking and less blowing stuff up then you'll enjoy this. Some action, interesting characters, nice plot twists plus who doesn't like a good conspiracy theory type of flick? My reviews are usually short since it's how I felt a movie rather than dissecting the minutiae. For me movies work or they don't sometimes it's action but almost always it's about the story for me, So that's where my reviews come from...

    Seems like quite a few give The arrival negative reviews. Some people always complain. You have to use your imagination while watching this movie. First of all: I liked Charlie Sheen. He plays a nerd with a goatee who is a little bit like MacGyver. He can construct a lab in his attic with duct tape and some stuff bought at the local store. That is cool. He has a street wise attitude also. I also like the paradox that Charlie Sheen is a super smart astronomer. It makes my mind itch in a good way. Granted, he has a standard expression that gets a bit tiresome at times, but you'll just have to live with it!! After all, you haters almost got to see Sheen killed by a collapsing bath room floor. That was a great scene! Secondly: There is a love story here that I liked. I don't find the woman particularly attractive and I don't like her business attitude, but there are some tender scenes. Thirdly: I liked the aliens and how they had infiltrated society and dressed up in human skins. It was cool that one of the aliens in Mexico had the same face as Sheen's boss. What was really good was that the aliens had an agenda that they never gave up, and the boss explained that they just did in 10 years what humans would do themselves in 100. The aliens can also jump 5 meters into the air. So this is waaaay cooler than Independence day. Here, we see smart aliens, and we actually care about the main character.

    While the monumental and most expensive alien invasion picture of 1996 was declaring our independence; this modest, small budget sci-fi thriller overachieved with an intelligent, clever storyline and a well-written script. Zane (Charlie Sheen) is an astronomer who discovers a communication and alien life forms, and the extraterrestrials are pulling out all the stops to silence his discovery. Those who crave conspiracy theories and cover ups will be more than satisfied and plot keeps the audience guessing through out. Sheen does a very nice job and there's an intriguing storyline that actually holds substance. David Twohy deserves a great deal of credit here not only writing the script but also directing it.

    What if aliens planned to colonize earth ? Would they view us humans as a species to be subdued or they would rather prefer to settle peacefully with humans sharing the resources of this planet ? In case they wanted to subdue us, would they do it by using brutal force as e.g. in the 'War of the Worlds' or other more indirect (but more effective nonetheless) means ? 'Arrival' is a film that depicts aliens already present on earth and working on their plan for domination. Charlie Sheen plays astrophysicist Zane Zaminsky who struggles to survive in science since he is getting paid by short-term grants that are about to expire. From his scientific observations he picks up a signal that leads him to aliens already present on earth. Sheen is a good actor and portrays the curious astrophysicist well enough with a charming touch of a slight paranoia and some beliefs in conspiracy theories. Sheen goes to the extremes to prove his point first to his girlfriend (played by Teri Polo) who initially distrusts him and then to his bosses in the observatory. The film has a strong b-movie character and I think that's the reason it is more entertaining given the subject; it takes more liberties with the script and even if the situations are a bit over the top sometimes they are still suspenseful. A 7/10 from me.

    Too bad they chose C. Sheen to be the main actor in this film. The guy act as if he is under the influence of some pretty intense stuff, like crack/cocaine. His facial expression and wide open-eyes were a major let-down. It was annoying in fact. With a better actor, someone that has more than one type of face this would be a much better film because the plot/script were no that bad. Lately, most science fiction films involve some conspiracy by evil government or the evil military... At least, in this film someone else is responsible for all the bad things...

    I must confess I liked it. I the genre and just thought it was really engaging all the way to the end. Charlie Sheen was great and the concept is really cool. However the way Charlie's character just outsmarted the ETs was not believable. Also the ETs were really clumsy at trying to kill him. Kiki became Zane's (good character name by the way)friend and knew all about his latest discoveries. Why didn't he kill Zane before he went to Mexico? Addicionally, the security system at the ET's plant sucked. Really amateur stuff for some superior race with superior technology. Anyways, just go with it and have a good time. Better than a lot of films that I have had the guts to see lately.

    The one thing that I must say about this movie is that it is very subtle in its execution. It is about an alien invasion of Earth which has already begun. We know that this is what the movie is about, but we are not directly encountered by the aliens until later in the movie. What it does is that it slowly reveals to us that something is wrong. The movie opens with a huge patch of greenery in the North Pole, and then we are taken to a radio telescope where a beam sent from a star, Wolf 359 or something like that, is intercepted. When this beam is pursued, the main character meets lots of objections. Soon he uncovers an alien conspiracy to terraform the earth to their liking but releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As I said before the movie is very subtle in its execution, and it also leads you to think one thing, which then turns around and reveals something else. One is the nature of his girlfriend, and another is in the nuclear power plant. This is a pretty good movie with the message that if we don't start looking after our planet, then it might be given to somebody else. I guess there is a very strong environmental theme in this movie, and it is used with the backdrop of an alien invasion. It is not a movie where major battles are won, but rather more subtle in its ending. Though he may has succeeded, it is still open to speculation whether it really worked or not.

    This is the movie that does well on repeat viewings. I watched it over 30 times and stopped counting. It clearly has no flaws that's why repeat viewing is easy. Starts slow win Zane Ziminsky identifies a star with intelligent signals but is fired at NASA, and his boss clearly destroys evidence, and go to unimaginable length to keep it silent. While Zane Ziminsky is worked for a cable television to get by, he tries to construct his own version of radio telescope using Phase Array for a cheaper version, but equally effective. Identifies the signal again, but this comes from the bounce of an earth base signal in Mexico of the same signal, which means they were talking to each other! So he goes see Carl, his assistant, but before that happens, he gets murdered. Another scientist on Green house gases, tries to get data from NASA, but everything seems wrong, no data, but she did identify green house gases comes from Mexico. So both Zeminsky and the women scientist independently traveled to Mexico. This is a classic Sci Fi, introducing the concepts of phase array, green house emissions, global warming, terraforming (to make it inhabitable on earth!), and then some. It is the most seriously under rated movie of all time, and if introduced in theaters it will stun intelligent viewer, but didn't take it, as theaters go for explosions, crashes, etc. but it would have been as good as category as Gattaca, but Gattaca as plot holes, this one is clearly the best.

Well written and directed by David Twohy, this science fiction film is a pleasant surprise, and Charlie Sheen is appealing and believable as the man determined to find the truth, and warn the world; sounds like a certain FBI agent from "The X-Files"...

    No spoilers...ever... It's a really fun movie with a cast that did a fine job of making it feel right. Is that the acting of the directing? Who freaking cares, it's fun. While there are a handful of what could be 'action' scenes it is the characters and plot itself which made this a fun watch to me. I won't do the spoiler thing but if you want a bit more thinking and less blowing stuff up then you'll enjoy this. Some action, interesting characters, nice plot twists plus who doesn't like a good conspiracy theory type of flick? My reviews are usually short since it's how I felt a movie rather than dissecting the minutiae. For me movies work or they don't sometimes it's action but almost always it's about the story for me, So that's where my reviews come from...

    Seems like quite a few give The arrival negative reviews. Some people always complain. You have to use your imagination while watching this movie. First of all: I liked Charlie Sheen. He plays a nerd with a goatee who is a little bit like MacGyver. He can construct a lab in his attic with duct tape and some stuff bought at the local store. That is cool. He has a street wise attitude also. I also like the paradox that Charlie Sheen is a super smart astronomer. It makes my mind itch in a good way. Granted, he has a standard expression that gets a bit tiresome at times, but you'll just have to live with it!! After all, you haters almost got to see Sheen killed by a collapsing bath room floor. That was a great scene! Secondly: There is a love story here that I liked. I don't find the woman particularly attractive and I don't like her business attitude, but there are some tender scenes. Thirdly: I liked the aliens and how they had infiltrated society and dressed up in human skins. It was cool that one of the aliens in Mexico had the same face as Sheen's boss. What was really good was that the aliens had an agenda that they never gave up, and the boss explained that they just did in 10 years what humans would do themselves in 100. The aliens can also jump 5 meters into the air. So this is waaaay cooler than Independence day. Here, we see smart aliens, and we actually care about the main character.

    While the monumental and most expensive alien invasion picture of 1996 was declaring our independence; this modest, small budget sci-fi thriller overachieved with an intelligent, clever storyline and a well-written script. Zane (Charlie Sheen) is an astronomer who discovers a communication and alien life forms, and the extraterrestrials are pulling out all the stops to silence his discovery. Those who crave conspiracy theories and cover ups will be more than satisfied and plot keeps the audience guessing through out. Sheen does a very nice job and there's an intriguing storyline that actually holds substance. David Twohy deserves a great deal of credit here not only writing the script but also directing it.

    What if aliens planned to colonize earth ? Would they view us humans as a species to be subdued or they would rather prefer to settle peacefully with humans sharing the resources of this planet ? In case they wanted to subdue us, would they do it by using brutal force as e.g. in the 'War of the Worlds' or other more indirect (but more effective nonetheless) means ? 'Arrival' is a film that depicts aliens already present on earth and working on their plan for domination. Charlie Sheen plays astrophysicist Zane Zaminsky who struggles to survive in science since he is getting paid by short-term grants that are about to expire. From his scientific observations he picks up a signal that leads him to aliens already present on earth. Sheen is a good actor and portrays the curious astrophysicist well enough with a charming touch of a slight paranoia and some beliefs in conspiracy theories. Sheen goes to the extremes to prove his point first to his girlfriend (played by Teri Polo) who initially distrusts him and then to his bosses in the observatory. The film has a strong b-movie character and I think that's the reason it is more entertaining given the subject; it takes more liberties with the script and even if the situations are a bit over the top sometimes they are still suspenseful. A 7/10 from me.

    Too bad they chose C. Sheen to be the main actor in this film. The guy act as if he is under the influence of some pretty intense stuff, like crack/cocaine. His facial expression and wide open-eyes were a major let-down. It was annoying in fact. With a better actor, someone that has more than one type of face this would be a much better film because the plot/script were no that bad. Lately, most science fiction films involve some conspiracy by evil government or the evil military... At least, in this film someone else is responsible for all the bad things...

    I must confess I liked it. I the genre and just thought it was really engaging all the way to the end. Charlie Sheen was great and the concept is really cool. However the way Charlie's character just outsmarted the ETs was not believable. Also the ETs were really clumsy at trying to kill him. Kiki became Zane's (good character name by the way)friend and knew all about his latest discoveries. Why didn't he kill Zane before he went to Mexico? Addicionally, the security system at the ET's plant sucked. Really amateur stuff for some superior race with superior technology. Anyways, just go with it and have a good time. Better than a lot of films that I have had the guts to see lately.

    The one thing that I must say about this movie is that it is very subtle in its execution. It is about an alien invasion of Earth which has already begun. We know that this is what the movie is about, but we are not directly encountered by the aliens until later in the movie. What it does is that it slowly reveals to us that something is wrong. The movie opens with a huge patch of greenery in the North Pole, and then we are taken to a radio telescope where a beam sent from a star, Wolf 359 or something like that, is intercepted. When this beam is pursued, the main character meets lots of objections. Soon he uncovers an alien conspiracy to terraform the earth to their liking but releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As I said before the movie is very subtle in its execution, and it also leads you to think one thing, which then turns around and reveals something else. One is the nature of his girlfriend, and another is in the nuclear power plant. This is a pretty good movie with the message that if we don't start looking after our planet, then it might be given to somebody else. I guess there is a very strong environmental theme in this movie, and it is used with the backdrop of an alien invasion. It is not a movie where major battles are won, but rather more subtle in its ending. Though he may has succeeded, it is still open to speculation whether it really worked or not.

    This is the movie that does well on repeat viewings. I watched it over 30 times and stopped counting. It clearly has no flaws that's why repeat viewing is easy. Starts slow win Zane Ziminsky identifies a star with intelligent signals but is fired at NASA, and his boss clearly destroys evidence, and go to unimaginable length to keep it silent. While Zane Ziminsky is worked for a cable television to get by, he tries to construct his own version of radio telescope using Phase Array for a cheaper version, but equally effective. Identifies the signal again, but this comes from the bounce of an earth base signal in Mexico of the same signal, which means they were talking to each other! So he goes see Carl, his assistant, but before that happens, he gets murdered. Another scientist on Green house gases, tries to get data from NASA, but everything seems wrong, no data, but she did identify green house gases comes from Mexico. So both Zeminsky and the women scientist independently traveled to Mexico. This is a classic Sci Fi, introducing the concepts of phase array, green house emissions, global warming, terraforming (to make it inhabitable on earth!), and then some. It is the most seriously under rated movie of all time, and if introduced in theaters it will stun intelligent viewer, but didn't take it, as theaters go for explosions, crashes, etc. but it would have been as good as category as Gattaca, but Gattaca as plot holes, this one is clearly the best.

    No spoilers...ever... It's a really fun movie with a cast that did a fine job of making it feel right. Is that the acting of the directing? Who freaking cares, it's fun. While there are a handful of what could be 'action' scenes it is the characters and plot itself which made this a fun watch to me. I won't do the spoiler thing but if you want a bit more thinking and less blowing stuff up then you'll enjoy this. Some action, interesting characters, nice plot twists plus who doesn't like a good conspiracy theory type of flick? My reviews are usually short since it's how I felt a movie rather than dissecting the minutiae. For me movies work or they don't sometimes it's action but almost always it's about the story for me, So that's where my reviews come from...

    Seems like quite a few give The arrival negative reviews. Some people always complain. You have to use your imagination while watching this movie. First of all: I liked Charlie Sheen. He plays a nerd with a goatee who is a little bit like MacGyver. He can construct a lab in his attic with duct tape and some stuff bought at the local store. That is cool. He has a street wise attitude also. I also like the paradox that Charlie Sheen is a super smart astronomer. It makes my mind itch in a good way. Granted, he has a standard expression that gets a bit tiresome at times, but you'll just have to live with it!! After all, you haters almost got to see Sheen killed by a collapsing bath room floor. That was a great scene! Secondly: There is a love story here that I liked. I don't find the woman particularly attractive and I don't like her business attitude, but there are some tender scenes. Thirdly: I liked the aliens and how they had infiltrated society and dressed up in human skins. It was cool that one of the aliens in Mexico had the same face as Sheen's boss. What was really good was that the aliens had an agenda that they never gave up, and the boss explained that they just did in 10 years what humans would do themselves in 100. The aliens can also jump 5 meters into the air. So this is waaaay cooler than Independence day. Here, we see smart aliens, and we actually care about the main character.

    While the monumental and most expensive alien invasion picture of 1996 was declaring our independence; this modest, small budget sci-fi thriller overachieved with an intelligent, clever storyline and a well-written script. Zane (Charlie Sheen) is an astronomer who discovers a communication and alien life forms, and the extraterrestrials are pulling out all the stops to silence his discovery. Those who crave conspiracy theories and cover ups will be more than satisfied and plot keeps the audience guessing through out. Sheen does a very nice job and there's an intriguing storyline that actually holds substance. David Twohy deserves a great deal of credit here not only writing the script but also directing it.

    What if aliens planned to colonize earth ? Would they view us humans as a species to be subdued or they would rather prefer to settle peacefully with humans sharing the resources of this planet ? In case they wanted to subdue us, would they do it by using brutal force as e.g. in the 'War of the Worlds' or other more indirect (but more effective nonetheless) means ? 'Arrival' is a film that depicts aliens already present on earth and working on their plan for domination. Charlie Sheen plays astrophysicist Zane Zaminsky who struggles to survive in science since he is getting paid by short-term grants that are about to expire. From his scientific observations he picks up a signal that leads him to aliens already present on earth. Sheen is a good actor and portrays the curious astrophysicist well enough with a charming touch of a slight paranoia and some beliefs in conspiracy theories. Sheen goes to the extremes to prove his point first to his girlfriend (played by Teri Polo) who initially distrusts him and then to his bosses in the observatory. The film has a strong b-movie character and I think that's the reason it is more entertaining given the subject; it takes more liberties with the script and even if the situations are a bit over the top sometimes they are still suspenseful. A 7/10 from me.

    Too bad they chose C. Sheen to be the main actor in this film. The guy act as if he is under the influence of some pretty intense stuff, like crack/cocaine. His facial expression and wide open-eyes were a major let-down. It was annoying in fact. With a better actor, someone that has more than one type of face this would be a much better film because the plot/script were no that bad. Lately, most science fiction films involve some conspiracy by evil government or the evil military... At least, in this film someone else is responsible for all the bad things...

    I must confess I liked it. I the genre and just thought it was really engaging all the way to the end. Charlie Sheen was great and the concept is really cool. However the way Charlie's character just outsmarted the ETs was not believable. Also the ETs were really clumsy at trying to kill him. Kiki became Zane's (good character name by the way)friend and knew all about his latest discoveries. Why didn't he kill Zane before he went to Mexico? Addicionally, the security system at the ET's plant sucked. Really amateur stuff for some superior race with superior technology. Anyways, just go with it and have a good time. Better than a lot of films that I have had the guts to see lately.

    The one thing that I must say about this movie is that it is very subtle in its execution. It is about an alien invasion of Earth which has already begun. We know that this is what the movie is about, but we are not directly encountered by the aliens until later in the movie. What it does is that it slowly reveals to us that something is wrong. The movie opens with a huge patch of greenery in the North Pole, and then we are taken to a radio telescope where a beam sent from a star, Wolf 359 or something like that, is intercepted. When this beam is pursued, the main character meets lots of objections. Soon he uncovers an alien conspiracy to terraform the earth to their liking but releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As I said before the movie is very subtle in its execution, and it also leads you to think one thing, which then turns around and reveals something else. One is the nature of his girlfriend, and another is in the nuclear power plant. This is a pretty good movie with the message that if we don't start looking after our planet, then it might be given to somebody else. I guess there is a very strong environmental theme in this movie, and it is used with the backdrop of an alien invasion. It is not a movie where major battles are won, but rather more subtle in its ending. Though he may has succeeded, it is still open to speculation whether it really worked or not.

    This is the movie that does well on repeat viewings. I watched it over 30 times and stopped counting. It clearly has no flaws that's why repeat viewing is easy. Starts slow win Zane Ziminsky identifies a star with intelligent signals but is fired at NASA, and his boss clearly destroys evidence, and go to unimaginable length to keep it silent. While Zane Ziminsky is worked for a cable television to get by, he tries to construct his own version of radio telescope using Phase Array for a cheaper version, but equally effective. Identifies the signal again, but this comes from the bounce of an earth base signal in Mexico of the same signal, which means they were talking to each other! So he goes see Carl, his assistant, but before that happens, he gets murdered. Another scientist on Green house gases, tries to get data from NASA, but everything seems wrong, no data, but she did identify green house gases comes from Mexico. So both Zeminsky and the women scientist independently traveled to Mexico. This is a classic Sci Fi, introducing the concepts of phase array, green house emissions, global warming, terraforming (to make it inhabitable on earth!), and then some. It is the most seriously under rated movie of all time, and if introduced in theaters it will stun intelligent viewer, but didn't take it, as theaters go for explosions, crashes, etc. but it would have been as good as category as Gattaca, but Gattaca as plot holes, this one is clearly the best.

    Charlie Sheen plays Zane, a radio astronomer who accidentally discovers an alien signal from space, that also has origins on Earth. When he tries to tell his boss(Ron Silver, very good) he downplays and denies the importance of the find. Zane then finds out he has been fired, and the tape he gave to his boss disappears, so now very suspicious, he undertakes his own investigation, which leads him to an alarming truth about aliens who are indeed very much among us... Well written and directed by David Twohy, this science fiction film is a pleasant surprise, and Charlie Sheen is appealing and believable as the man determined to find the truth, and warn the world; sounds like a certain FBI agent from "The X-Files"...

    While the monumental and most expensive alien invasion picture of 1996 was declaring our independence; this modest, small budget sci-fi thriller overachieved with an intelligent, clever storyline and a well-written script. Zane (Charlie Sheen) is an astronomer who discovers a communication and alien life forms, and the extraterrestrials are pulling out all the stops to silence his discovery. Those who crave conspiracy theories and cover ups will be more than satisfied and plot keeps the audience guessing through out. Sheen does a very nice job and there's an intriguing storyline that actually holds substance. David Twohy deserves a great deal of credit here not only writing the script but also directing it.

    What if aliens planned to colonize earth ? Would they view us humans as a species to be subdued or they would rather prefer to settle peacefully with humans sharing the resources of this planet ? In case they wanted to subdue us, would they do it by using brutal force as e.g. in the 'War of the Worlds' or other more indirect (but more effective nonetheless) means ? 'Arrival' is a film that depicts aliens already present on earth and working on their plan for domination. Charlie Sheen plays astrophysicist Zane Zaminsky who struggles to survive in science since he is getting paid by short-term grants that are about to expire. From his scientific observations he picks up a signal that leads him to aliens already present on earth. Sheen is a good actor and portrays the curious astrophysicist well enough with a charming touch of a slight paranoia and some beliefs in conspiracy theories. Sheen goes to the extremes to prove his point first to his girlfriend (played by Teri Polo) who initially distrusts him and then to his bosses in the observatory. The film has a strong b-movie character and I think that's the reason it is more entertaining given the subject; it takes more liberties with the script and even if the situations are a bit over the top sometimes they are still suspenseful. A 7/10 from me.

    Too bad they chose C. Sheen to be the main actor in this film. The guy act as if he is under the influence of some pretty intense stuff, like crack/cocaine. His facial expression and wide open-eyes were a major let-down. It was annoying in fact. With a better actor, someone that has more than one type of face this would be a much better film because the plot/script were no that bad. Lately, most science fiction films involve some conspiracy by evil government or the evil military... At least, in this film someone else is responsible for all the bad things...

    I must confess I liked it. I the genre and just thought it was really engaging all the way to the end. Charlie Sheen was great and the concept is really cool. However the way Charlie's character just outsmarted the ETs was not believable. Also the ETs were really clumsy at trying to kill him. Kiki became Zane's (good character name by the way)friend and knew all about his latest discoveries. Why didn't he kill Zane before he went to Mexico? Addicionally, the security system at the ET's plant sucked. Really amateur stuff for some superior race with superior technology. Anyways, just go with it and have a good time. Better than a lot of films that I have had the guts to see lately.

    The one thing that I must say about this movie is that it is very subtle in its execution. It is about an alien invasion of Earth which has already begun. We know that this is what the movie is about, but we are not directly encountered by the aliens until later in the movie. What it does is that it slowly reveals to us that something is wrong. The movie opens with a huge patch of greenery in the North Pole, and then we are taken to a radio telescope where a beam sent from a star, Wolf 359 or something like that, is intercepted. When this beam is pursued, the main character meets lots of objections. Soon he uncovers an alien conspiracy to terraform the earth to their liking but releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As I said before the movie is very subtle in its execution, and it also leads you to think one thing, which then turns around and reveals something else. One is the nature of his girlfriend, and another is in the nuclear power plant. This is a pretty good movie with the message that if we don't start looking after our planet, then it might be given to somebody else. I guess there is a very strong environmental theme in this movie, and it is used with the backdrop of an alien invasion. It is not a movie where major battles are won, but rather more subtle in its ending. Though he may has succeeded, it is still open to speculation whether it really worked or not.

    This is the movie that does well on repeat viewings. I watched it over 30 times and stopped counting. It clearly has no flaws that's why repeat viewing is easy. Starts slow win Zane Ziminsky identifies a star with intelligent signals but is fired at NASA, and his boss clearly destroys evidence, and go to unimaginable length to keep it silent. While Zane Ziminsky is worked for a cable television to get by, he tries to construct his own version of radio telescope using Phase Array for a cheaper version, but equally effective. Identifies the signal again, but this comes from the bounce of an earth base signal in Mexico of the same signal, which means they were talking to each other! So he goes see Carl, his assistant, but before that happens, he gets murdered. Another scientist on Green house gases, tries to get data from NASA, but everything seems wrong, no data, but she did identify green house gases comes from Mexico. So both Zeminsky and the women scientist independently traveled to Mexico. This is a classic Sci Fi, introducing the concepts of phase array, green house emissions, global warming, terraforming (to make it inhabitable on earth!), and then some. It is the most seriously under rated movie of all time, and if introduced in theaters it will stun intelligent viewer, but didn't take it, as theaters go for explosions, crashes, etc. but it would have been as good as category as Gattaca, but Gattaca as plot holes, this one is clearly the best.

    Charlie Sheen plays Zane, a radio astronomer who accidentally discovers an alien signal from space, that also has origins on Earth. When he tries to tell his boss(Ron Silver, very good) he downplays and denies the importance of the find. Zane then finds out he has been fired, and the tape he gave to his boss disappears, so now very suspicious, he undertakes his own investigation, which leads him to an alarming truth about aliens who are indeed very much among us... Well written and directed by David Twohy, this science fiction film is a pleasant surprise, and Charlie Sheen is appealing and believable as the man determined to find the truth, and warn the world; sounds like a certain FBI agent from "The X-Files"...

    No spoilers...ever... It's a really fun movie with a cast that did a fine job of making it feel right. Is that the acting of the directing? Who freaking cares, it's fun. While there are a handful of what could be 'action' scenes it is the characters and plot itself which made this a fun watch to me. I won't do the spoiler thing but if you want a bit more thinking and less blowing stuff up then you'll enjoy this. Some action, interesting characters, nice plot twists plus who doesn't like a good conspiracy theory type of flick? My reviews are usually short since it's how I felt a movie rather than dissecting the minutiae. For me movies work or they don't sometimes it's action but almost always it's about the story for me, So that's where my reviews come from...

    Seems like quite a few give The arrival negative reviews. Some people always complain. You have to use your imagination while watching this movie. First of all: I liked Charlie Sheen. He plays a nerd with a goatee who is a little bit like MacGyver. He can construct a lab in his attic with duct tape and some stuff bought at the local store. That is cool. He has a street wise attitude also. I also like the paradox that Charlie Sheen is a super smart astronomer. It makes my mind itch in a good way. Granted, he has a standard expression that gets a bit tiresome at times, but you'll just have to live with it!! After all, you haters almost got to see Sheen killed by a collapsing bath room floor. That was a great scene! Secondly: There is a love story here that I liked. I don't find the woman particularly attractive and I don't like her business attitude, but there are some tender scenes. Thirdly: I liked the aliens and how they had infiltrated society and dressed up in human skins. It was cool that one of the aliens in Mexico had the same face as Sheen's boss. What was really good was that the aliens had an agenda that they never gave up, and the boss explained that they just did in 10 years what humans would do themselves in 100. The aliens can also jump 5 meters into the air. So this is waaaay cooler than Independence day. Here, we see smart aliens, and we actually care about the main character.

    Too bad they chose C. Sheen to be the main actor in this film. The guy act as if he is under the influence of some pretty intense stuff, like crack/cocaine. His facial expression and wide open-eyes were a major let-down. It was annoying in fact. With a better actor, someone that has more than one type of face this would be a much better film because the plot/script were no that bad. Lately, most science fiction films involve some conspiracy by evil government or the evil military... At least, in this film someone else is responsible for all the bad things...

    I must confess I liked it. I the genre and just thought it was really engaging all the way to the end. Charlie Sheen was great and the concept is really cool. However the way Charlie's character just outsmarted the ETs was not believable. Also the ETs were really clumsy at trying to kill him. Kiki became Zane's (good character name by the way)friend and knew all about his latest discoveries. Why didn't he kill Zane before he went to Mexico? Addicionally, the security system at the ET's plant sucked. Really amateur stuff for some superior race with superior technology. Anyways, just go with it and have a good time. Better than a lot of films that I have had the guts to see lately.

    The one thing that I must say about this movie is that it is very subtle in its execution. It is about an alien invasion of Earth which has already begun. We know that this is what the movie is about, but we are not directly encountered by the aliens until later in the movie. What it does is that it slowly reveals to us that something is wrong. The movie opens with a huge patch of greenery in the North Pole, and then we are taken to a radio telescope where a beam sent from a star, Wolf 359 or something like that, is intercepted. When this beam is pursued, the main character meets lots of objections. Soon he uncovers an alien conspiracy to terraform the earth to their liking but releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As I said before the movie is very subtle in its execution, and it also leads you to think one thing, which then turns around and reveals something else. One is the nature of his girlfriend, and another is in the nuclear power plant. This is a pretty good movie with the message that if we don't start looking after our planet, then it might be given to somebody else. I guess there is a very strong environmental theme in this movie, and it is used with the backdrop of an alien invasion. It is not a movie where major battles are won, but rather more subtle in its ending. Though he may has succeeded, it is still open to speculation whether it really worked or not.

    This is the movie that does well on repeat viewings. I watched it over 30 times and stopped counting. It clearly has no flaws that's why repeat viewing is easy. Starts slow win Zane Ziminsky identifies a star with intelligent signals but is fired at NASA, and his boss clearly destroys evidence, and go to unimaginable length to keep it silent. While Zane Ziminsky is worked for a cable television to get by, he tries to construct his own version of radio telescope using Phase Array for a cheaper version, but equally effective. Identifies the signal again, but this comes from the bounce of an earth base signal in Mexico of the same signal, which means they were talking to each other! So he goes see Carl, his assistant, but before that happens, he gets murdered. Another scientist on Green house gases, tries to get data from NASA, but everything seems wrong, no data, but she did identify green house gases comes from Mexico. So both Zeminsky and the women scientist independently traveled to Mexico. This is a classic Sci Fi, introducing the concepts of phase array, green house emissions, global warming, terraforming (to make it inhabitable on earth!), and then some. It is the most seriously under rated movie of all time, and if introduced in theaters it will stun intelligent viewer, but didn't take it, as theaters go for explosions, crashes, etc. but it would have been as good as category as Gattaca, but Gattaca as plot holes, this one is clearly the best.

    Charlie Sheen plays Zane, a radio astronomer who accidentally discovers an alien signal from space, that also has origins on Earth. When he tries to tell his boss(Ron Silver, very good) he downplays and denies the importance of the find. Zane then finds out he has been fired, and the tape he gave to his boss disappears, so now very suspicious, he undertakes his own investigation, which leads him to an alarming truth about aliens who are indeed very much among us... Well written and directed by David Twohy, this science fiction film is a pleasant surprise, and Charlie Sheen is appealing and believable as the man determined to find the truth, and warn the world; sounds like a certain FBI agent from "The X-Files"...

    No spoilers...ever... It's a really fun movie with a cast that did a fine job of making it feel right. Is that the acting of the directing? Who freaking cares, it's fun. While there are a handful of what could be 'action' scenes it is the characters and plot itself which made this a fun watch to me. I won't do the spoiler thing but if you want a bit more thinking and less blowing stuff up then you'll enjoy this. Some action, interesting characters, nice plot twists plus who doesn't like a good conspiracy theory type of flick? My reviews are usually short since it's how I felt a movie rather than dissecting the minutiae. For me movies work or they don't sometimes it's action but almost always it's about the story for me, So that's where my reviews come from...

    Seems like quite a few give The arrival negative reviews. Some people always complain. You have to use your imagination while watching this movie. First of all: I liked Charlie Sheen. He plays a nerd with a goatee who is a little bit like MacGyver. He can construct a lab in his attic with duct tape and some stuff bought at the local store. That is cool. He has a street wise attitude also. I also like the paradox that Charlie Sheen is a super smart astronomer. It makes my mind itch in a good way. Granted, he has a standard expression that gets a bit tiresome at times, but you'll just have to live with it!! After all, you haters almost got to see Sheen killed by a collapsing bath room floor. That was a great scene! Secondly: There is a love story here that I liked. I don't find the woman particularly attractive and I don't like her business attitude, but there are some tender scenes. Thirdly: I liked the aliens and how they had infiltrated society and dressed up in human skins. It was cool that one of the aliens in Mexico had the same face as Sheen's boss. What was really good was that the aliens had an agenda that they never gave up, and the boss explained that they just did in 10 years what humans would do themselves in 100. The aliens can also jump 5 meters into the air. So this is waaaay cooler than Independence day. Here, we see smart aliens, and we actually care about the main character.

    While the monumental and most expensive alien invasion picture of 1996 was declaring our independence; this modest, small budget sci-fi thriller overachieved with an intelligent, clever storyline and a well-written script. Zane (Charlie Sheen) is an astronomer who discovers a communication and alien life forms, and the extraterrestrials are pulling out all the stops to silence his discovery. Those who crave conspiracy theories and cover ups will be more than satisfied and plot keeps the audience guessing through out. Sheen does a very nice job and there's an intriguing storyline that actually holds substance. David Twohy deserves a great deal of credit here not only writing the script but also directing it.

    What if aliens planned to colonize earth ? Would they view us humans as a species to be subdued or they would rather prefer to settle peacefully with humans sharing the resources of this planet ? In case they wanted to subdue us, would they do it by using brutal force as e.g. in the 'War of the Worlds' or other more indirect (but more effective nonetheless) means ? 'Arrival' is a film that depicts aliens already present on earth and working on their plan for domination. Charlie Sheen plays astrophysicist Zane Zaminsky who struggles to survive in science since he is getting paid by short-term grants that are about to expire. From his scientific observations he picks up a signal that leads him to aliens already present on earth. Sheen is a good actor and portrays the curious astrophysicist well enough with a charming touch of a slight paranoia and some beliefs in conspiracy theories. Sheen goes to the extremes to prove his point first to his girlfriend (played by Teri Polo) who initially distrusts him and then to his bosses in the observatory. The film has a strong b-movie character and I think that's the reason it is more entertaining given the subject; it takes more liberties with the script and even if the situations are a bit over the top sometimes they are still suspenseful. A 7/10 from me.
