    Whoever reviewed this movie did a horrible job, because they forget to mention all the nudity throughout the movie. Right away at the beginning, they show a woman's exposed bosoms when she's in the bathtub. Later on in an illusion scene, a man is surrounded around dozens of topless ladies. This was a really great movie and I enjoyed watching it. I had a huge problem with all the female nudity in the movie. I came to this site to see if this movie contained any nudity and I was lied to. The content review on this site only mentioned that this movie only showed the side of a woman's breast. There was a scene when that did happen, but the person who wrote the content review must have walked out the room when the "real" nudity was being shown.

    I much preferred the original to these types of movies like House of the Demons (all) and Demons 1&2. This movie is a cheesy Hollywood ripoff. The originals didn't have some stupid item that stole the importance from its characters. Its much more fun watching the characters running around not knowing how to deal with the situation than some cheesy cross artifact that lands right in their lap every time they're in a bit of a tangle. Predictable? Yes to the extreme which is why the originals pour crapola all over this tasteless ripoff. I'm rating this down cause so many idiots don't know a good movie when they see it.

    Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight is a forgotten and underrated gem. From the outset, the movie sets it pace as "all out" and doesn't let up. Being a TFTC title, of course it is filled with camp, but at it's heart this is just classic, good old fashioned horror fun. Billy Zane's performance as "The Collector" is one of his best and shows his chops as something more than just another handsome guy. Also strong is William Sadler - here taking a break from his oft-played redneck roles and delivering a surprisingly deep character in Brayker. The entire ensemble is made up of terrific actors and, even in a campy horror movie, they give strong performances. the story itself felt different, and not simply a retread of other horror flicks. It has a certain cleverness and wit that I find is missing in many movies of it's type. If i were going to categorize this I'd place it closer to "The Cabin In The Woods" or "From Duck 'Til Dawn" than i would "Dead Alive" or the "Saw" films. One could say it was overdone in parts, or too campy, but they'd be missing the point. This is a "Tales From The Crypt" movie, after all, and a touch of the eccentric and camp is to be expected. There is more to this movie than meets the eye and, if one goes into with an open mind, they will be rewarded with one HELL of a ride. Overall, I thought TFTC: Demon Knight was unorthodox in it's approach and handled well in terms of the balance between camp, horror, comedy, and drama. The acting and actors are strong and play sit straight, despite it's tone and topic. The effects are great, including some innovative design work, and the soundtrack is still good to this day. I recommend this one to any horror fan.

    Billy Zane, William Sadler, Jada Pinkett, Thomas Haden Church, Charles Fleischer, CCH Pounder, Brenda Bakke and Dick Miller star in this 1995 horror film based on the TV series and horror comics. This begins with the infamous Crypt Keeper (Voiced by John Kassir) directing a cheesy horror film before presenting this tale. It begins with a man, Brayker (Sadler) who is chased by a collector (Zane) while driving on a long stretch of road. Brayker is able to get away from him and comes to a run-down motel where the residents are about to be in for a nightmare. Soon, The collector comes and reveals himself as a demon trying to get hold of an ancient key that Brayker possesses. Brayker is also revealed to be a Demon Knight who tries to protect them from him and search for the next chosen one who will fight the forces of evil. Pinkett plays Jeryline, Fleischer (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) plays square postman, Wally, Bakke (Hot Shots! Part Deux) plays prostitute, Cordelia who Wally likes, Church (Spider-Man 3) plays her rotten boyfriend, Roach, Pounder (End Of Days) plays Irene, the owner of the motel and Miller (Gremlins) plays drunk, Willy. This is a good 90's horror flick and Zane and Sadler are great in it. I recommend this.

    Demon Knight is a B movie that shouldn't be underestimated. Taking its ques from the hit-or-miss HBO series "Tales From the Crypt", Demon Knight is a horror movie that never takes itself too seriously and has a lot of positive going for it. As a "horror" movie, it is boiler plate, average, run of the mill. But, the self aware gags it has with itself, the decent effects, and the interesting development and pace it takes sets it above the crap you might expect. A masterpiece this is not, but it's fun, can be dark and serious, and has it's humor when needed. Also, this movie is worth the watch just for Billy Zane alone. And if you say Bordello of Blood is better than this movie, your sarcasm is appreciated.

    "DEMON KNIGHT" is a criminally underrated masterpiece of 1990s B-cinema; I argue that it stands with other genre siblings like THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS and DEAD ALIVE as an overlooked gem composed of everything enjoyable about the horror movie experience. DK is incredibly fun. Bloody, gory, goofy fun, but it's also quite surprising. It accepts its limitations, both financial and thematic (due to being a "Tales From the Crypt" project) and embraces them with all the enthusiasm and grandeur it deserves and some that it doesn't. It accepts that its premise is fundamentally far-fetched, but also accepts that to the characters, its nothing short of completely real, and so the story and the cast treats it as such and that is what sets it above other, disappointing kitsch horror films that stray into the meta or take themselves overwhelmingly seriously for an underwhelming concept. What sells this film more than anything else is the cast; it's a testament to the craft to watch them work here. They never wink to the audience or treat the material with disdain, but instead, give it all they have (without veering into parody or kabuki), and that sells the importance necessary to invest in the characters and care about their plight. Virtually everyone in this film except Dick Miller is cast against type, and given a character in stark contrast with the ones they are usually given in films and TV outside. The most notable is Thomas Haden Church, who devastates his charming, adorable iconic role of Lowell in "Wings" as the loathsome, irredeemable, belligerent Roach. Sadler in particular is affecting as Brayker, who is a character of such quiet dignity and resignation that I truly wonder why he hasn't been offered more roles like this since. The true standout, however, is Billy Zane, who has such unparalleled charisma and humor that had this film been recognized at its time for its greatness, Zane would be remembered for The Collector and not for TITANIC. Zane's performance as The Collector is nothing less than on par with Christoph Waltz's Landa in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. If that sounds like hyperbole, then you have yet to see the evidence to the contrary. You really can't go wrong as a horror movie fan, casual or serious, with giving this film a go. Even if you don't find it to be your cup of tea, you'd be hard pressed to argue that it wasn't worth your time. DEMON KNIGHT is actually worthy of your time. Give it a shot.

    This is one of my all time favorite movies, and it's the very first movie I saw more than twice while still in theaters. I was already a fan of Tales from the Crypt, and with this movie, there were constant thrills from beginning to end, and everyone was involved in causing those thrills. This was also the very first movie I ever saw Jada Pinkett in--I had never even heard of her before; I absolutely loved her part, and I was already a William Sadler fan from having seen him in Die Hard 2. From beginning to end, the action & suspense keeps you rolling right along on the edge of your seat! The bottom line is this is a movie that I absolutely love, & I have seen it more than 20 times already. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was that it took about 8-10 minutes or so for the actual movie to start. : )

    "Demon Knight," the first film adaptation of the hit HBO series, "Tales from the Crypt," finds a drifter (William Sadler) on the run from a clan of demons and their mysterious and maniacal ringleader (Billy Zane). Holed up in a sleazy, run-down hotel, the drifter joins forces with a mix of jerks, half-wits, under-achievers and hussies in an effort to stave off the evil forces at bay just outside their doorstep. In keeping with the series it's based off of, "Demon Knight" is quite simply a boatload of good gory horror fun. Filled to the rafters with over-the-top action, zany characters and colorful gore and special effects, it's a rare treat in the otherwise desolate wasteland that is 90's horror. The cast is really a big part of what carries the film, though. Billy Zane plays the charismatic bad guy superbly, while Sadler underplays his role a bit by comparison. Jada Pinkett has a noteworthy part as a Sarah Connor-type tough-girl who saves the day. Thomas Haden Church hams it up and gives Zane a run for his money with some of the film's most quotable lines. Director Ernest Dickerson puts on a dazzling show but knows well enough not to take the material too seriously and the film is all the better for it. Not only does the film look good, but it delivers exactly the type of thrills that horror fans who love a little humor thrown in the mix can appreciate. Unfortunately, the funhouse thrills wear off somewhere in the second half when the film attempts to expand its meager plot. Truth be told, the film is a lot more fun when we know next to nothing about the main characters or their motives. Even still, though, one can't help but be bowled over by the delightfully cheesy yet thrilling fun-fest that the film delivers. From its excellent and eclectic ensemble cast to its heavy metal soundtrack featuring the likes of Pantera and Filter, "Demon Knight" is an offer no fun-loving horror fan can refuse.

    I saw this movie for the first time around 13 years ago, I was just a kid. Back in the day me and my dad went to Videoland every 2 weeks or so and rented 10 flicks at a time for a week, VHS off course. For my age ( around 10 ) I was interested in very different movies then my classmates or friends. I always picked out action, ninja and horror movies, like Commando, Gremlins, Highway to Hell etc. This time I picked Demon Knight, as well as 9 other movies which off course I can't remember. But the funny thing is, I never watched a single one of them. Yes people, for 7 days straight I was sucked into Demon Knight. I was so impressed by this movie back then, that I watched it like 15 times in 1 week. For me this movie is a cult classic and is one of my favorite movies of all time. I grew older, so I know a "good" movie is something like Godfather or the Dark Knight ( generally speaking ) but the memories from this movie from when I was a kid are still engraved into my mind and I can watch it anytime with full enjoyment. Sorry for the small back story but I really wanted to try and tell why I love this freaking movie. This movie starts off with a drifter named Brayker ( William Sadler ) trying to get away from a cowboy-like dude called The Collector, which is a role meant to be played by Billy Zane. This guy just nails it, and is definitely the star in this movie. After a car crash with a big bang, Sadler makes a run for an old church converted into a bar. This will be set piece for the whole movie. We find out that Sadler has a mysterious Relic and Zane is a demon working as a collector trying to get the relic back to his masters. Because before the earth was created it was ruled by demons, and they had 7 keys to keep the planet in darkness. Then god came along and divided the keys and drove off the demons. The key Sadler holds is the last one they need to bring back eternal darkness. I know it sounds cheesy and it is, but it doesn't really matter. Inside the key is blood, which can be used to seal doors and windows to create a blood barricade so the demons can't enter, this idea always fascinated me and I remember playing as a kid with colored water to replicate this tool. This movie has it all. 8 People stuck in a bar getting attacked by the demons of darkness. You got your typical asshole Roach, the friendly old uncle Willy, local prostitute Cordelia, nerdy type guy Wally, big momma Irene and the young Jada Pinkett Smith adding some drama to this movie. But Billy Zane is king as the collector, an evil character with a laid back style and lots of twisted humor. After the first dull 15 minutes, sh!t will hit the fan when Zane just punches right through a police officer's head, Classic ! And it gets better, we even see an arm getting ripped off, brilliant. Zane brings out some demon sidekicks, really ugly looking bastards, but they look cool, to get into the hotel and attack. The lame thing is, that you need to shoot 'em in the eyes to kill them, I've seen that before. What I also liked about this flick was how Zane tries to bribe everyone in change for their souls. Uncle Willy for example got into a dream-like scene where he was surrounded by dozens of women, topless ! Awe-some movie people. Zane as star, and Sadler respectively second playing a believable character on the run for his life and that off the entire world. We see fists through face punches, arms getting ripped off, explosions, blood, demons, boobies. This is a classic !

    "Demon Knight," the first film adaptation of the hit HBO series, "Tales from the Crypt," finds a drifter (William Sadler) on the run from a clan of demons and their mysterious and maniacal ringleader (Billy Zane). Holed up in a sleazy, run-down hotel, the drifter joins forces with a mix of jerks, half-wits, under-achievers and hussies in an effort to stave off the evil forces at bay just outside their doorstep. In keeping with the series it's based off of, "Demon Knight" is quite simply a boatload of good gory horror fun. Filled to the rafters with over-the-top action, zany characters and colorful gore and special effects, it's a rare treat in the otherwise desolate wasteland that is 90's horror. The cast is really a big part of what carries the film, though. Billy Zane plays the charismatic bad guy superbly, while Sadler underplays his role a bit by comparison. Jada Pinkett has a noteworthy part as a Sarah Connor-type tough-girl who saves the day. Thomas Haden Church hams it up and gives Zane a run for his money with some of the film's most quotable lines. Director Ernest Dickerson puts on a dazzling show but knows well enough not to take the material too seriously and the film is all the better for it. Not only does the film look good, but it delivers exactly the type of thrills that horror fans who love a little humor thrown in the mix can appreciate. Unfortunately, the funhouse thrills wear off somewhere in the second half when the film attempts to expand its meager plot. Truth be told, the film is a lot more fun when we know next to nothing about the main characters or their motives. Even still, though, one can't help but be bowled over by the delightfully cheesy yet thrilling fun-fest that the film delivers. From its excellent and eclectic ensemble cast to its heavy metal soundtrack featuring the likes of Pantera and Filter, "Demon Knight" is an offer no fun-loving horror fan can refuse.

    I saw this movie for the first time around 13 years ago, I was just a kid. Back in the day me and my dad went to Videoland every 2 weeks or so and rented 10 flicks at a time for a week, VHS off course. For my age ( around 10 ) I was interested in very different movies then my classmates or friends. I always picked out action, ninja and horror movies, like Commando, Gremlins, Highway to Hell etc. This time I picked Demon Knight, as well as 9 other movies which off course I can't remember. But the funny thing is, I never watched a single one of them. Yes people, for 7 days straight I was sucked into Demon Knight. I was so impressed by this movie back then, that I watched it like 15 times in 1 week. For me this movie is a cult classic and is one of my favorite movies of all time. I grew older, so I know a "good" movie is something like Godfather or the Dark Knight ( generally speaking ) but the memories from this movie from when I was a kid are still engraved into my mind and I can watch it anytime with full enjoyment. Sorry for the small back story but I really wanted to try and tell why I love this freaking movie. This movie starts off with a drifter named Brayker ( William Sadler ) trying to get away from a cowboy-like dude called The Collector, which is a role meant to be played by Billy Zane. This guy just nails it, and is definitely the star in this movie. After a car crash with a big bang, Sadler makes a run for an old church converted into a bar. This will be set piece for the whole movie. We find out that Sadler has a mysterious Relic and Zane is a demon working as a collector trying to get the relic back to his masters. Because before the earth was created it was ruled by demons, and they had 7 keys to keep the planet in darkness. Then god came along and divided the keys and drove off the demons. The key Sadler holds is the last one they need to bring back eternal darkness. I know it sounds cheesy and it is, but it doesn't really matter. Inside the key is blood, which can be used to seal doors and windows to create a blood barricade so the demons can't enter, this idea always fascinated me and I remember playing as a kid with colored water to replicate this tool. This movie has it all. 8 People stuck in a bar getting attacked by the demons of darkness. You got your typical asshole Roach, the friendly old uncle Willy, local prostitute Cordelia, nerdy type guy Wally, big momma Irene and the young Jada Pinkett Smith adding some drama to this movie. But Billy Zane is king as the collector, an evil character with a laid back style and lots of twisted humor. After the first dull 15 minutes, sh!t will hit the fan when Zane just punches right through a police officer's head, Classic ! And it gets better, we even see an arm getting ripped off, brilliant. Zane brings out some demon sidekicks, really ugly looking bastards, but they look cool, to get into the hotel and attack. The lame thing is, that you need to shoot 'em in the eyes to kill them, I've seen that before. What I also liked about this flick was how Zane tries to bribe everyone in change for their souls. Uncle Willy for example got into a dream-like scene where he was surrounded by dozens of women, topless ! Awe-some movie people. Zane as star, and Sadler respectively second playing a believable character on the run for his life and that off the entire world. We see fists through face punches, arms getting ripped off, explosions, blood, demons, boobies. This is a classic !

    Whoever reviewed this movie did a horrible job, because they forget to mention all the nudity throughout the movie. Right away at the beginning, they show a woman's exposed bosoms when she's in the bathtub. Later on in an illusion scene, a man is surrounded around dozens of topless ladies. This was a really great movie and I enjoyed watching it. I had a huge problem with all the female nudity in the movie. I came to this site to see if this movie contained any nudity and I was lied to. The content review on this site only mentioned that this movie only showed the side of a woman's breast. There was a scene when that did happen, but the person who wrote the content review must have walked out the room when the "real" nudity was being shown.

    I much preferred the original to these types of movies like House of the Demons (all) and Demons 1&2. This movie is a cheesy Hollywood ripoff. The originals didn't have some stupid item that stole the importance from its characters. Its much more fun watching the characters running around not knowing how to deal with the situation than some cheesy cross artifact that lands right in their lap every time they're in a bit of a tangle. Predictable? Yes to the extreme which is why the originals pour crapola all over this tasteless ripoff. I'm rating this down cause so many idiots don't know a good movie when they see it.

    Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight is a forgotten and underrated gem. From the outset, the movie sets it pace as "all out" and doesn't let up. Being a TFTC title, of course it is filled with camp, but at it's heart this is just classic, good old fashioned horror fun. Billy Zane's performance as "The Collector" is one of his best and shows his chops as something more than just another handsome guy. Also strong is William Sadler - here taking a break from his oft-played redneck roles and delivering a surprisingly deep character in Brayker. The entire ensemble is made up of terrific actors and, even in a campy horror movie, they give strong performances. the story itself felt different, and not simply a retread of other horror flicks. It has a certain cleverness and wit that I find is missing in many movies of it's type. If i were going to categorize this I'd place it closer to "The Cabin In The Woods" or "From Duck 'Til Dawn" than i would "Dead Alive" or the "Saw" films. One could say it was overdone in parts, or too campy, but they'd be missing the point. This is a "Tales From The Crypt" movie, after all, and a touch of the eccentric and camp is to be expected. There is more to this movie than meets the eye and, if one goes into with an open mind, they will be rewarded with one HELL of a ride. Overall, I thought TFTC: Demon Knight was unorthodox in it's approach and handled well in terms of the balance between camp, horror, comedy, and drama. The acting and actors are strong and play sit straight, despite it's tone and topic. The effects are great, including some innovative design work, and the soundtrack is still good to this day. I recommend this one to any horror fan.

    Billy Zane, William Sadler, Jada Pinkett, Thomas Haden Church, Charles Fleischer, CCH Pounder, Brenda Bakke and Dick Miller star in this 1995 horror film based on the TV series and horror comics. This begins with the infamous Crypt Keeper (Voiced by John Kassir) directing a cheesy horror film before presenting this tale. It begins with a man, Brayker (Sadler) who is chased by a collector (Zane) while driving on a long stretch of road. Brayker is able to get away from him and comes to a run-down motel where the residents are about to be in for a nightmare. Soon, The collector comes and reveals himself as a demon trying to get hold of an ancient key that Brayker possesses. Brayker is also revealed to be a Demon Knight who tries to protect them from him and search for the next chosen one who will fight the forces of evil. Pinkett plays Jeryline, Fleischer (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) plays square postman, Wally, Bakke (Hot Shots! Part Deux) plays prostitute, Cordelia who Wally likes, Church (Spider-Man 3) plays her rotten boyfriend, Roach, Pounder (End Of Days) plays Irene, the owner of the motel and Miller (Gremlins) plays drunk, Willy. This is a good 90's horror flick and Zane and Sadler are great in it. I recommend this.

    Demon Knight is a B movie that shouldn't be underestimated. Taking its ques from the hit-or-miss HBO series "Tales From the Crypt", Demon Knight is a horror movie that never takes itself too seriously and has a lot of positive going for it. As a "horror" movie, it is boiler plate, average, run of the mill. But, the self aware gags it has with itself, the decent effects, and the interesting development and pace it takes sets it above the crap you might expect. A masterpiece this is not, but it's fun, can be dark and serious, and has it's humor when needed. Also, this movie is worth the watch just for Billy Zane alone. And if you say Bordello of Blood is better than this movie, your sarcasm is appreciated.

    "DEMON KNIGHT" is a criminally underrated masterpiece of 1990s B-cinema; I argue that it stands with other genre siblings like THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS and DEAD ALIVE as an overlooked gem composed of everything enjoyable about the horror movie experience. DK is incredibly fun. Bloody, gory, goofy fun, but it's also quite surprising. It accepts its limitations, both financial and thematic (due to being a "Tales From the Crypt" project) and embraces them with all the enthusiasm and grandeur it deserves and some that it doesn't. It accepts that its premise is fundamentally far-fetched, but also accepts that to the characters, its nothing short of completely real, and so the story and the cast treats it as such and that is what sets it above other, disappointing kitsch horror films that stray into the meta or take themselves overwhelmingly seriously for an underwhelming concept. What sells this film more than anything else is the cast; it's a testament to the craft to watch them work here. They never wink to the audience or treat the material with disdain, but instead, give it all they have (without veering into parody or kabuki), and that sells the importance necessary to invest in the characters and care about their plight. Virtually everyone in this film except Dick Miller is cast against type, and given a character in stark contrast with the ones they are usually given in films and TV outside. The most notable is Thomas Haden Church, who devastates his charming, adorable iconic role of Lowell in "Wings" as the loathsome, irredeemable, belligerent Roach. Sadler in particular is affecting as Brayker, who is a character of such quiet dignity and resignation that I truly wonder why he hasn't been offered more roles like this since. The true standout, however, is Billy Zane, who has such unparalleled charisma and humor that had this film been recognized at its time for its greatness, Zane would be remembered for The Collector and not for TITANIC. Zane's performance as The Collector is nothing less than on par with Christoph Waltz's Landa in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. If that sounds like hyperbole, then you have yet to see the evidence to the contrary. You really can't go wrong as a horror movie fan, casual or serious, with giving this film a go. Even if you don't find it to be your cup of tea, you'd be hard pressed to argue that it wasn't worth your time. DEMON KNIGHT is actually worthy of your time. Give it a shot.

    This is one of my all time favorite movies, and it's the very first movie I saw more than twice while still in theaters. I was already a fan of Tales from the Crypt, and with this movie, there were constant thrills from beginning to end, and everyone was involved in causing those thrills. This was also the very first movie I ever saw Jada Pinkett in--I had never even heard of her before; I absolutely loved her part, and I was already a William Sadler fan from having seen him in Die Hard 2. From beginning to end, the action & suspense keeps you rolling right along on the edge of your seat! The bottom line is this is a movie that I absolutely love, & I have seen it more than 20 times already. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was that it took about 8-10 minutes or so for the actual movie to start. : )

It accepts that its premise is fundamentally far-fetched, but also accepts that to the characters, its nothing short of completely real, and so the story and the cast treats it as such and that is what sets it above other, disappointing kitsch horror films that stray into the meta or take themselves overwhelmingly seriously for an underwhelming concept. What sells this film more than anything else is the cast; it's a testament to the craft to watch them work here. They never wink to the audience or treat the material with disdain, but instead, give it all they have (without veering into parody or kabuki), and that sells the importance necessary to invest in the characters and care about their plight. Virtually everyone in this film except Dick Miller is cast against type, and given a character in stark contrast with the ones they are usually given in films and TV outside. The most notable is Thomas Haden Church, who devastates his charming, adorable iconic role of Lowell in "Wings" as the loathsome, irredeemable, belligerent Roach. Sadler in particular is affecting as Brayker, who is a character of such quiet dignity and resignation that I truly wonder why he hasn't been offered more roles like this since. The true standout, however, is Billy Zane, who has such unparalleled charisma and humor that had this film been recognized at its time for its greatness, Zane would be remembered for The Collector and not for TITANIC. Zane's performance as The Collector is nothing less than on par with Christoph Waltz's Landa in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. If that sounds like hyperbole, then you have yet to see the evidence to the contrary. You really can't go wrong as a horror movie fan, casual or serious, with giving this film a go. Even if you don't find it to be your cup of tea, you'd be hard pressed to argue that it wasn't worth your time. DEMON KNIGHT is actually worthy of your time. Give it a shot.

    This is one of my all time favorite movies, and it's the very first movie I saw more than twice while still in theaters. I was already a fan of Tales from the Crypt, and with this movie, there were constant thrills from beginning to end, and everyone was involved in causing those thrills. This was also the very first movie I ever saw Jada Pinkett in--I had never even heard of her before; I absolutely loved her part, and I was already a William Sadler fan from having seen him in Die Hard 2. From beginning to end, the action & suspense keeps you rolling right along on the edge of your seat! The bottom line is this is a movie that I absolutely love, & I have seen it more than 20 times already. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was that it took about 8-10 minutes or so for the actual movie to start. : )

    "Demon Knight," the first film adaptation of the hit HBO series, "Tales from the Crypt," finds a drifter (William Sadler) on the run from a clan of demons and their mysterious and maniacal ringleader (Billy Zane). Holed up in a sleazy, run-down hotel, the drifter joins forces with a mix of jerks, half-wits, under-achievers and hussies in an effort to stave off the evil forces at bay just outside their doorstep. In keeping with the series it's based off of, "Demon Knight" is quite simply a boatload of good gory horror fun. Filled to the rafters with over-the-top action, zany characters and colorful gore and special effects, it's a rare treat in the otherwise desolate wasteland that is 90's horror. The cast is really a big part of what carries the film, though. Billy Zane plays the charismatic bad guy superbly, while Sadler underplays his role a bit by comparison. Jada Pinkett has a noteworthy part as a Sarah Connor-type tough-girl who saves the day. Thomas Haden Church hams it up and gives Zane a run for his money with some of the film's most quotable lines. Director Ernest Dickerson puts on a dazzling show but knows well enough not to take the material too seriously and the film is all the better for it. Not only does the film look good, but it delivers exactly the type of thrills that horror fans who love a little humor thrown in the mix can appreciate. Unfortunately, the funhouse thrills wear off somewhere in the second half when the film attempts to expand its meager plot. Truth be told, the film is a lot more fun when we know next to nothing about the main characters or their motives. Even still, though, one can't help but be bowled over by the delightfully cheesy yet thrilling fun-fest that the film delivers. From its excellent and eclectic ensemble cast to its heavy metal soundtrack featuring the likes of Pantera and Filter, "Demon Knight" is an offer no fun-loving horror fan can refuse.

    I saw this movie for the first time around 13 years ago, I was just a kid. Back in the day me and my dad went to Videoland every 2 weeks or so and rented 10 flicks at a time for a week, VHS off course. For my age ( around 10 ) I was interested in very different movies then my classmates or friends. I always picked out action, ninja and horror movies, like Commando, Gremlins, Highway to Hell etc. This time I picked Demon Knight, as well as 9 other movies which off course I can't remember. But the funny thing is, I never watched a single one of them. Yes people, for 7 days straight I was sucked into Demon Knight. I was so impressed by this movie back then, that I watched it like 15 times in 1 week. For me this movie is a cult classic and is one of my favorite movies of all time. I grew older, so I know a "good" movie is something like Godfather or the Dark Knight ( generally speaking ) but the memories from this movie from when I was a kid are still engraved into my mind and I can watch it anytime with full enjoyment. Sorry for the small back story but I really wanted to try and tell why I love this freaking movie. This movie starts off with a drifter named Brayker ( William Sadler ) trying to get away from a cowboy-like dude called The Collector, which is a role meant to be played by Billy Zane. This guy just nails it, and is definitely the star in this movie. After a car crash with a big bang, Sadler makes a run for an old church converted into a bar. This will be set piece for the whole movie. We find out that Sadler has a mysterious Relic and Zane is a demon working as a collector trying to get the relic back to his masters. Because before the earth was created it was ruled by demons, and they had 7 keys to keep the planet in darkness. Then god came along and divided the keys and drove off the demons. The key Sadler holds is the last one they need to bring back eternal darkness. I know it sounds cheesy and it is, but it doesn't really matter. Inside the key is blood, which can be used to seal doors and windows to create a blood barricade so the demons can't enter, this idea always fascinated me and I remember playing as a kid with colored water to replicate this tool. This movie has it all. 8 People stuck in a bar getting attacked by the demons of darkness. You got your typical asshole Roach, the friendly old uncle Willy, local prostitute Cordelia, nerdy type guy Wally, big momma Irene and the young Jada Pinkett Smith adding some drama to this movie. But Billy Zane is king as the collector, an evil character with a laid back style and lots of twisted humor. After the first dull 15 minutes, sh!t will hit the fan when Zane just punches right through a police officer's head, Classic ! And it gets better, we even see an arm getting ripped off, brilliant. Zane brings out some demon sidekicks, really ugly looking bastards, but they look cool, to get into the hotel and attack. The lame thing is, that you need to shoot 'em in the eyes to kill them, I've seen that before. What I also liked about this flick was how Zane tries to bribe everyone in change for their souls. Uncle Willy for example got into a dream-like scene where he was surrounded by dozens of women, topless ! Awe-some movie people. Zane as star, and Sadler respectively second playing a believable character on the run for his life and that off the entire world. We see fists through face punches, arms getting ripped off, explosions, blood, demons, boobies. This is a classic !

    Whoever reviewed this movie did a horrible job, because they forget to mention all the nudity throughout the movie. Right away at the beginning, they show a woman's exposed bosoms when she's in the bathtub. Later on in an illusion scene, a man is surrounded around dozens of topless ladies. This was a really great movie and I enjoyed watching it. I had a huge problem with all the female nudity in the movie. I came to this site to see if this movie contained any nudity and I was lied to. The content review on this site only mentioned that this movie only showed the side of a woman's breast. There was a scene when that did happen, but the person who wrote the content review must have walked out the room when the "real" nudity was being shown.

    I much preferred the original to these types of movies like House of the Demons (all) and Demons 1&2. This movie is a cheesy Hollywood ripoff. The originals didn't have some stupid item that stole the importance from its characters. Its much more fun watching the characters running around not knowing how to deal with the situation than some cheesy cross artifact that lands right in their lap every time they're in a bit of a tangle. Predictable? Yes to the extreme which is why the originals pour crapola all over this tasteless ripoff. I'm rating this down cause so many idiots don't know a good movie when they see it.

    Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight is a forgotten and underrated gem. From the outset, the movie sets it pace as "all out" and doesn't let up. Being a TFTC title, of course it is filled with camp, but at it's heart this is just classic, good old fashioned horror fun. Billy Zane's performance as "The Collector" is one of his best and shows his chops as something more than just another handsome guy. Also strong is William Sadler - here taking a break from his oft-played redneck roles and delivering a surprisingly deep character in Brayker. The entire ensemble is made up of terrific actors and, even in a campy horror movie, they give strong performances. the story itself felt different, and not simply a retread of other horror flicks. It has a certain cleverness and wit that I find is missing in many movies of it's type. If i were going to categorize this I'd place it closer to "The Cabin In The Woods" or "From Duck 'Til Dawn" than i would "Dead Alive" or the "Saw" films. One could say it was overdone in parts, or too campy, but they'd be missing the point. This is a "Tales From The Crypt" movie, after all, and a touch of the eccentric and camp is to be expected. There is more to this movie than meets the eye and, if one goes into with an open mind, they will be rewarded with one HELL of a ride. Overall, I thought TFTC: Demon Knight was unorthodox in it's approach and handled well in terms of the balance between camp, horror, comedy, and drama. The acting and actors are strong and play sit straight, despite it's tone and topic. The effects are great, including some innovative design work, and the soundtrack is still good to this day. I recommend this one to any horror fan.

    Billy Zane, William Sadler, Jada Pinkett, Thomas Haden Church, Charles Fleischer, CCH Pounder, Brenda Bakke and Dick Miller star in this 1995 horror film based on the TV series and horror comics. This begins with the infamous Crypt Keeper (Voiced by John Kassir) directing a cheesy horror film before presenting this tale. It begins with a man, Brayker (Sadler) who is chased by a collector (Zane) while driving on a long stretch of road. Brayker is able to get away from him and comes to a run-down motel where the residents are about to be in for a nightmare. Soon, The collector comes and reveals himself as a demon trying to get hold of an ancient key that Brayker possesses. Brayker is also revealed to be a Demon Knight who tries to protect them from him and search for the next chosen one who will fight the forces of evil. Pinkett plays Jeryline, Fleischer (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) plays square postman, Wally, Bakke (Hot Shots! Part Deux) plays prostitute, Cordelia who Wally likes, Church (Spider-Man 3) plays her rotten boyfriend, Roach, Pounder (End Of Days) plays Irene, the owner of the motel and Miller (Gremlins) plays drunk, Willy. This is a good 90's horror flick and Zane and Sadler are great in it. I recommend this.

    Demon Knight is a B movie that shouldn't be underestimated. Taking its ques from the hit-or-miss HBO series "Tales From the Crypt", Demon Knight is a horror movie that never takes itself too seriously and has a lot of positive going for it. As a "horror" movie, it is boiler plate, average, run of the mill. But, the self aware gags it has with itself, the decent effects, and the interesting development and pace it takes sets it above the crap you might expect. A masterpiece this is not, but it's fun, can be dark and serious, and has it's humor when needed. Also, this movie is worth the watch just for Billy Zane alone. And if you say Bordello of Blood is better than this movie, your sarcasm is appreciated.

    "DEMON KNIGHT" is a criminally underrated masterpiece of 1990s B-cinema; I argue that it stands with other genre siblings like THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS and DEAD ALIVE as an overlooked gem composed of everything enjoyable about the horror movie experience. DK is incredibly fun. Bloody, gory, goofy fun, but it's also quite surprising. It accepts its limitations, both financial and thematic (due to being a "Tales From the Crypt" project) and embraces them with all the enthusiasm and grandeur it deserves and some that it doesn't. It accepts that its premise is fundamentally far-fetched, but also accepts that to the characters, its nothing short of completely real, and so the story and the cast treats it as such and that is what sets it above other, disappointing kitsch horror films that stray into the meta or take themselves overwhelmingly seriously for an underwhelming concept. What sells this film more than anything else is the cast; it's a testament to the craft to watch them work here. They never wink to the audience or treat the material with disdain, but instead, give it all they have (without veering into parody or kabuki), and that sells the importance necessary to invest in the characters and care about their plight. Virtually everyone in this film except Dick Miller is cast against type, and given a character in stark contrast with the ones they are usually given in films and TV outside. The most notable is Thomas Haden Church, who devastates his charming, adorable iconic role of Lowell in "Wings" as the loathsome, irredeemable, belligerent Roach. Sadler in particular is affecting as Brayker, who is a character of such quiet dignity and resignation that I truly wonder why he hasn't been offered more roles like this since. The true standout, however, is Billy Zane, who has such unparalleled charisma and humor that had this film been recognized at its time for its greatness, Zane would be remembered for The Collector and not for TITANIC. Zane's performance as The Collector is nothing less than on par with Christoph Waltz's Landa in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. If that sounds like hyperbole, then you have yet to see the evidence to the contrary. You really can't go wrong as a horror movie fan, casual or serious, with giving this film a go. Even if you don't find it to be your cup of tea, you'd be hard pressed to argue that it wasn't worth your time. DEMON KNIGHT is actually worthy of your time. Give it a shot.

    Billy Zane, William Sadler, Jada Pinkett, Thomas Haden Church, Charles Fleischer, CCH Pounder, Brenda Bakke and Dick Miller star in this 1995 horror film based on the TV series and horror comics. This begins with the infamous Crypt Keeper (Voiced by John Kassir) directing a cheesy horror film before presenting this tale. It begins with a man, Brayker (Sadler) who is chased by a collector (Zane) while driving on a long stretch of road. Brayker is able to get away from him and comes to a run-down motel where the residents are about to be in for a nightmare. Soon, The collector comes and reveals himself as a demon trying to get hold of an ancient key that Brayker possesses. Brayker is also revealed to be a Demon Knight who tries to protect them from him and search for the next chosen one who will fight the forces of evil. Pinkett plays Jeryline, Fleischer (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) plays square postman, Wally, Bakke (Hot Shots! Part Deux) plays prostitute, Cordelia who Wally likes, Church (Spider-Man 3) plays her rotten boyfriend, Roach, Pounder (End Of Days) plays Irene, the owner of the motel and Miller (Gremlins) plays drunk, Willy. This is a good 90's horror flick and Zane and Sadler are great in it. I recommend this.

    Demon Knight is a B movie that shouldn't be underestimated. Taking its ques from the hit-or-miss HBO series "Tales From the Crypt", Demon Knight is a horror movie that never takes itself too seriously and has a lot of positive going for it. As a "horror" movie, it is boiler plate, average, run of the mill. But, the self aware gags it has with itself, the decent effects, and the interesting development and pace it takes sets it above the crap you might expect. A masterpiece this is not, but it's fun, can be dark and serious, and has it's humor when needed. Also, this movie is worth the watch just for Billy Zane alone. And if you say Bordello of Blood is better than this movie, your sarcasm is appreciated.

    "DEMON KNIGHT" is a criminally underrated masterpiece of 1990s B-cinema; I argue that it stands with other genre siblings like THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS and DEAD ALIVE as an overlooked gem composed of everything enjoyable about the horror movie experience. DK is incredibly fun. Bloody, gory, goofy fun, but it's also quite surprising. It accepts its limitations, both financial and thematic (due to being a "Tales From the Crypt" project) and embraces them with all the enthusiasm and grandeur it deserves and some that it doesn't. It accepts that its premise is fundamentally far-fetched, but also accepts that to the characters, its nothing short of completely real, and so the story and the cast treats it as such and that is what sets it above other, disappointing kitsch horror films that stray into the meta or take themselves overwhelmingly seriously for an underwhelming concept. What sells this film more than anything else is the cast; it's a testament to the craft to watch them work here. They never wink to the audience or treat the material with disdain, but instead, give it all they have (without veering into parody or kabuki), and that sells the importance necessary to invest in the characters and care about their plight. Virtually everyone in this film except Dick Miller is cast against type, and given a character in stark contrast with the ones they are usually given in films and TV outside. The most notable is Thomas Haden Church, who devastates his charming, adorable iconic role of Lowell in "Wings" as the loathsome, irredeemable, belligerent Roach. Sadler in particular is affecting as Brayker, who is a character of such quiet dignity and resignation that I truly wonder why he hasn't been offered more roles like this since. The true standout, however, is Billy Zane, who has such unparalleled charisma and humor that had this film been recognized at its time for its greatness, Zane would be remembered for The Collector and not for TITANIC. Zane's performance as The Collector is nothing less than on par with Christoph Waltz's Landa in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. If that sounds like hyperbole, then you have yet to see the evidence to the contrary. You really can't go wrong as a horror movie fan, casual or serious, with giving this film a go. Even if you don't find it to be your cup of tea, you'd be hard pressed to argue that it wasn't worth your time. DEMON KNIGHT is actually worthy of your time. Give it a shot.

    This is one of my all time favorite movies, and it's the very first movie I saw more than twice while still in theaters. I was already a fan of Tales from the Crypt, and with this movie, there were constant thrills from beginning to end, and everyone was involved in causing those thrills. This was also the very first movie I ever saw Jada Pinkett in--I had never even heard of her before; I absolutely loved her part, and I was already a William Sadler fan from having seen him in Die Hard 2. From beginning to end, the action & suspense keeps you rolling right along on the edge of your seat! The bottom line is this is a movie that I absolutely love, & I have seen it more than 20 times already. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was that it took about 8-10 minutes or so for the actual movie to start. : )

    "Demon Knight," the first film adaptation of the hit HBO series, "Tales from the Crypt," finds a drifter (William Sadler) on the run from a clan of demons and their mysterious and maniacal ringleader (Billy Zane). Holed up in a sleazy, run-down hotel, the drifter joins forces with a mix of jerks, half-wits, under-achievers and hussies in an effort to stave off the evil forces at bay just outside their doorstep. In keeping with the series it's based off of, "Demon Knight" is quite simply a boatload of good gory horror fun. Filled to the rafters with over-the-top action, zany characters and colorful gore and special effects, it's a rare treat in the otherwise desolate wasteland that is 90's horror. The cast is really a big part of what carries the film, though. Billy Zane plays the charismatic bad guy superbly, while Sadler underplays his role a bit by comparison. Jada Pinkett has a noteworthy part as a Sarah Connor-type tough-girl who saves the day. Thomas Haden Church hams it up and gives Zane a run for his money with some of the film's most quotable lines. Director Ernest Dickerson puts on a dazzling show but knows well enough not to take the material too seriously and the film is all the better for it. Not only does the film look good, but it delivers exactly the type of thrills that horror fans who love a little humor thrown in the mix can appreciate. Unfortunately, the funhouse thrills wear off somewhere in the second half when the film attempts to expand its meager plot. Truth be told, the film is a lot more fun when we know next to nothing about the main characters or their motives. Even still, though, one can't help but be bowled over by the delightfully cheesy yet thrilling fun-fest that the film delivers. From its excellent and eclectic ensemble cast to its heavy metal soundtrack featuring the likes of Pantera and Filter, "Demon Knight" is an offer no fun-loving horror fan can refuse.

    I saw this movie for the first time around 13 years ago, I was just a kid. Back in the day me and my dad went to Videoland every 2 weeks or so and rented 10 flicks at a time for a week, VHS off course. For my age ( around 10 ) I was interested in very different movies then my classmates or friends. I always picked out action, ninja and horror movies, like Commando, Gremlins, Highway to Hell etc. This time I picked Demon Knight, as well as 9 other movies which off course I can't remember. But the funny thing is, I never watched a single one of them. Yes people, for 7 days straight I was sucked into Demon Knight. I was so impressed by this movie back then, that I watched it like 15 times in 1 week. For me this movie is a cult classic and is one of my favorite movies of all time. I grew older, so I know a "good" movie is something like Godfather or the Dark Knight ( generally speaking ) but the memories from this movie from when I was a kid are still engraved into my mind and I can watch it anytime with full enjoyment. Sorry for the small back story but I really wanted to try and tell why I love this freaking movie. This movie starts off with a drifter named Brayker ( William Sadler ) trying to get away from a cowboy-like dude called The Collector, which is a role meant to be played by Billy Zane. This guy just nails it, and is definitely the star in this movie. After a car crash with a big bang, Sadler makes a run for an old church converted into a bar. This will be set piece for the whole movie. We find out that Sadler has a mysterious Relic and Zane is a demon working as a collector trying to get the relic back to his masters. Because before the earth was created it was ruled by demons, and they had 7 keys to keep the planet in darkness. Then god came along and divided the keys and drove off the demons. The key Sadler holds is the last one they need to bring back eternal darkness. I know it sounds cheesy and it is, but it doesn't really matter. Inside the key is blood, which can be used to seal doors and windows to create a blood barricade so the demons can't enter, this idea always fascinated me and I remember playing as a kid with colored water to replicate this tool. This movie has it all. 8 People stuck in a bar getting attacked by the demons of darkness. You got your typical asshole Roach, the friendly old uncle Willy, local prostitute Cordelia, nerdy type guy Wally, big momma Irene and the young Jada Pinkett Smith adding some drama to this movie. But Billy Zane is king as the collector, an evil character with a laid back style and lots of twisted humor. After the first dull 15 minutes, sh!t will hit the fan when Zane just punches right through a police officer's head, Classic ! And it gets better, we even see an arm getting ripped off, brilliant. Zane brings out some demon sidekicks, really ugly looking bastards, but they look cool, to get into the hotel and attack. The lame thing is, that you need to shoot 'em in the eyes to kill them, I've seen that before. What I also liked about this flick was how Zane tries to bribe everyone in change for their souls. Uncle Willy for example got into a dream-like scene where he was surrounded by dozens of women, topless ! Awe-some movie people. Zane as star, and Sadler respectively second playing a believable character on the run for his life and that off the entire world. We see fists through face punches, arms getting ripped off, explosions, blood, demons, boobies. This is a classic !

    Whoever reviewed this movie did a horrible job, because they forget to mention all the nudity throughout the movie. Right away at the beginning, they show a woman's exposed bosoms when she's in the bathtub. Later on in an illusion scene, a man is surrounded around dozens of topless ladies. This was a really great movie and I enjoyed watching it. I had a huge problem with all the female nudity in the movie. I came to this site to see if this movie contained any nudity and I was lied to. The content review on this site only mentioned that this movie only showed the side of a woman's breast. There was a scene when that did happen, but the person who wrote the content review must have walked out the room when the "real" nudity was being shown.

    I much preferred the original to these types of movies like House of the Demons (all) and Demons 1&2. This movie is a cheesy Hollywood ripoff. The originals didn't have some stupid item that stole the importance from its characters. Its much more fun watching the characters running around not knowing how to deal with the situation than some cheesy cross artifact that lands right in their lap every time they're in a bit of a tangle. Predictable? Yes to the extreme which is why the originals pour crapola all over this tasteless ripoff. I'm rating this down cause so many idiots don't know a good movie when they see it.

    Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight is a forgotten and underrated gem. From the outset, the movie sets it pace as "all out" and doesn't let up. Being a TFTC title, of course it is filled with camp, but at it's heart this is just classic, good old fashioned horror fun. Billy Zane's performance as "The Collector" is one of his best and shows his chops as something more than just another handsome guy. Also strong is William Sadler - here taking a break from his oft-played redneck roles and delivering a surprisingly deep character in Brayker. The entire ensemble is made up of terrific actors and, even in a campy horror movie, they give strong performances. the story itself felt different, and not simply a retread of other horror flicks. It has a certain cleverness and wit that I find is missing in many movies of it's type. If i were going to categorize this I'd place it closer to "The Cabin In The Woods" or "From Duck 'Til Dawn" than i would "Dead Alive" or the "Saw" films. One could say it was overdone in parts, or too campy, but they'd be missing the point. This is a "Tales From The Crypt" movie, after all, and a touch of the eccentric and camp is to be expected. There is more to this movie than meets the eye and, if one goes into with an open mind, they will be rewarded with one HELL of a ride. Overall, I thought TFTC: Demon Knight was unorthodox in it's approach and handled well in terms of the balance between camp, horror, comedy, and drama. The acting and actors are strong and play sit straight, despite it's tone and topic. The effects are great, including some innovative design work, and the soundtrack is still good to this day. I recommend this one to any horror fan.

There was some really great effect in this movie, I loved of Bloody gory effect in this movie, some were really gooey There were some really scary Scene that will make you really Jump, I jumped few times in this movie. Really well paced and I loved the way the movie ended! The acting in this movie was really good! 9 out of 10

    I much preferred the original to these types of movies like House of the Demons (all) and Demons 1&2. This movie is a cheesy Hollywood ripoff. The originals didn't have some stupid item that stole the importance from its characters. Its much more fun watching the characters running around not knowing how to deal with the situation than some cheesy cross artifact that lands right in their lap every time they're in a bit of a tangle. Predictable? Yes to the extreme which is why the originals pour crapola all over this tasteless ripoff. I'm rating this down cause so many idiots don't know a good movie when they see it.

    Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight is a forgotten and underrated gem. From the outset, the movie sets it pace as "all out" and doesn't let up. Being a TFTC title, of course it is filled with camp, but at it's heart this is just classic, good old fashioned horror fun. Billy Zane's performance as "The Collector" is one of his best and shows his chops as something more than just another handsome guy. Also strong is William Sadler - here taking a break from his oft-played redneck roles and delivering a surprisingly deep character in Brayker. The entire ensemble is made up of terrific actors and, even in a campy horror movie, they give strong performances. the story itself felt different, and not simply a retread of other horror flicks. It has a certain cleverness and wit that I find is missing in many movies of it's type. If i were going to categorize this I'd place it closer to "The Cabin In The Woods" or "From Duck 'Til Dawn" than i would "Dead Alive" or the "Saw" films. One could say it was overdone in parts, or too campy, but they'd be missing the point. This is a "Tales From The Crypt" movie, after all, and a touch of the eccentric and camp is to be expected. There is more to this movie than meets the eye and, if one goes into with an open mind, they will be rewarded with one HELL of a ride. Overall, I thought TFTC: Demon Knight was unorthodox in it's approach and handled well in terms of the balance between camp, horror, comedy, and drama. The acting and actors are strong and play sit straight, despite it's tone and topic. The effects are great, including some innovative design work, and the soundtrack is still good to this day. I recommend this one to any horror fan.

    Billy Zane, William Sadler, Jada Pinkett, Thomas Haden Church, Charles Fleischer, CCH Pounder, Brenda Bakke and Dick Miller star in this 1995 horror film based on the TV series and horror comics. This begins with the infamous Crypt Keeper (Voiced by John Kassir) directing a cheesy horror film before presenting this tale. It begins with a man, Brayker (Sadler) who is chased by a collector (Zane) while driving on a long stretch of road. Brayker is able to get away from him and comes to a run-down motel where the residents are about to be in for a nightmare. Soon, The collector comes and reveals himself as a demon trying to get hold of an ancient key that Brayker possesses. Brayker is also revealed to be a Demon Knight who tries to protect them from him and search for the next chosen one who will fight the forces of evil. Pinkett plays Jeryline, Fleischer (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) plays square postman, Wally, Bakke (Hot Shots! Part Deux) plays prostitute, Cordelia who Wally likes, Church (Spider-Man 3) plays her rotten boyfriend, Roach, Pounder (End Of Days) plays Irene, the owner of the motel and Miller (Gremlins) plays drunk, Willy. This is a good 90's horror flick and Zane and Sadler are great in it. I recommend this.

    Demon Knight is a B movie that shouldn't be underestimated. Taking its ques from the hit-or-miss HBO series "Tales From the Crypt", Demon Knight is a horror movie that never takes itself too seriously and has a lot of positive going for it. As a "horror" movie, it is boiler plate, average, run of the mill. But, the self aware gags it has with itself, the decent effects, and the interesting development and pace it takes sets it above the crap you might expect. A masterpiece this is not, but it's fun, can be dark and serious, and has it's humor when needed. Also, this movie is worth the watch just for Billy Zane alone. And if you say Bordello of Blood is better than this movie, your sarcasm is appreciated.

    "DEMON KNIGHT" is a criminally underrated masterpiece of 1990s B-cinema; I argue that it stands with other genre siblings like THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS and DEAD ALIVE as an overlooked gem composed of everything enjoyable about the horror movie experience. DK is incredibly fun. Bloody, gory, goofy fun, but it's also quite surprising. It accepts its limitations, both financial and thematic (due to being a "Tales From the Crypt" project) and embraces them with all the enthusiasm and grandeur it deserves and some that it doesn't. It accepts that its premise is fundamentally far-fetched, but also accepts that to the characters, its nothing short of completely real, and so the story and the cast treats it as such and that is what sets it above other, disappointing kitsch horror films that stray into the meta or take themselves overwhelmingly seriously for an underwhelming concept. What sells this film more than anything else is the cast; it's a testament to the craft to watch them work here. They never wink to the audience or treat the material with disdain, but instead, give it all they have (without veering into parody or kabuki), and that sells the importance necessary to invest in the characters and care about their plight. Virtually everyone in this film except Dick Miller is cast against type, and given a character in stark contrast with the ones they are usually given in films and TV outside. The most notable is Thomas Haden Church, who devastates his charming, adorable iconic role of Lowell in "Wings" as the loathsome, irredeemable, belligerent Roach. Sadler in particular is affecting as Brayker, who is a character of such quiet dignity and resignation that I truly wonder why he hasn't been offered more roles like this since. The true standout, however, is Billy Zane, who has such unparalleled charisma and humor that had this film been recognized at its time for its greatness, Zane would be remembered for The Collector and not for TITANIC. Zane's performance as The Collector is nothing less than on par with Christoph Waltz's Landa in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. If that sounds like hyperbole, then you have yet to see the evidence to the contrary. You really can't go wrong as a horror movie fan, casual or serious, with giving this film a go. Even if you don't find it to be your cup of tea, you'd be hard pressed to argue that it wasn't worth your time. DEMON KNIGHT is actually worthy of your time. Give it a shot.

    This is one of my all time favorite movies, and it's the very first movie I saw more than twice while still in theaters. I was already a fan of Tales from the Crypt, and with this movie, there were constant thrills from beginning to end, and everyone was involved in causing those thrills. This was also the very first movie I ever saw Jada Pinkett in--I had never even heard of her before; I absolutely loved her part, and I was already a William Sadler fan from having seen him in Die Hard 2. From beginning to end, the action & suspense keeps you rolling right along on the edge of your seat! The bottom line is this is a movie that I absolutely love, & I have seen it more than 20 times already. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was that it took about 8-10 minutes or so for the actual movie to start. : )

    "Demon Knight," the first film adaptation of the hit HBO series, "Tales from the Crypt," finds a drifter (William Sadler) on the run from a clan of demons and their mysterious and maniacal ringleader (Billy Zane). Holed up in a sleazy, run-down hotel, the drifter joins forces with a mix of jerks, half-wits, under-achievers and hussies in an effort to stave off the evil forces at bay just outside their doorstep. In keeping with the series it's based off of, "Demon Knight" is quite simply a boatload of good gory horror fun. Filled to the rafters with over-the-top action, zany characters and colorful gore and special effects, it's a rare treat in the otherwise desolate wasteland that is 90's horror. The cast is really a big part of what carries the film, though. Billy Zane plays the charismatic bad guy superbly, while Sadler underplays his role a bit by comparison. Jada Pinkett has a noteworthy part as a Sarah Connor-type tough-girl who saves the day. Thomas Haden Church hams it up and gives Zane a run for his money with some of the film's most quotable lines. Director Ernest Dickerson puts on a dazzling show but knows well enough not to take the material too seriously and the film is all the better for it. Not only does the film look good, but it delivers exactly the type of thrills that horror fans who love a little humor thrown in the mix can appreciate. Unfortunately, the funhouse thrills wear off somewhere in the second half when the film attempts to expand its meager plot. Truth be told, the film is a lot more fun when we know next to nothing about the main characters or their motives. Even still, though, one can't help but be bowled over by the delightfully cheesy yet thrilling fun-fest that the film delivers. From its excellent and eclectic ensemble cast to its heavy metal soundtrack featuring the likes of Pantera and Filter, "Demon Knight" is an offer no fun-loving horror fan can refuse.

    I saw this movie for the first time around 13 years ago, I was just a kid. Back in the day me and my dad went to Videoland every 2 weeks or so and rented 10 flicks at a time for a week, VHS off course. For my age ( around 10 ) I was interested in very different movies then my classmates or friends. I always picked out action, ninja and horror movies, like Commando, Gremlins, Highway to Hell etc. This time I picked Demon Knight, as well as 9 other movies which off course I can't remember. But the funny thing is, I never watched a single one of them. Yes people, for 7 days straight I was sucked into Demon Knight. I was so impressed by this movie back then, that I watched it like 15 times in 1 week. For me this movie is a cult classic and is one of my favorite movies of all time. I grew older, so I know a "good" movie is something like Godfather or the Dark Knight ( generally speaking ) but the memories from this movie from when I was a kid are still engraved into my mind and I can watch it anytime with full enjoyment. Sorry for the small back story but I really wanted to try and tell why I love this freaking movie. This movie starts off with a drifter named Brayker ( William Sadler ) trying to get away from a cowboy-like dude called The Collector, which is a role meant to be played by Billy Zane. This guy just nails it, and is definitely the star in this movie. After a car crash with a big bang, Sadler makes a run for an old church converted into a bar. This will be set piece for the whole movie. We find out that Sadler has a mysterious Relic and Zane is a demon working as a collector trying to get the relic back to his masters. Because before the earth was created it was ruled by demons, and they had 7 keys to keep the planet in darkness. Then god came along and divided the keys and drove off the demons. The key Sadler holds is the last one they need to bring back eternal darkness. I know it sounds cheesy and it is, but it doesn't really matter. Inside the key is blood, which can be used to seal doors and windows to create a blood barricade so the demons can't enter, this idea always fascinated me and I remember playing as a kid with colored water to replicate this tool. This movie has it all. 8 People stuck in a bar getting attacked by the demons of darkness. You got your typical asshole Roach, the friendly old uncle Willy, local prostitute Cordelia, nerdy type guy Wally, big momma Irene and the young Jada Pinkett Smith adding some drama to this movie. But Billy Zane is king as the collector, an evil character with a laid back style and lots of twisted humor. After the first dull 15 minutes, sh!t will hit the fan when Zane just punches right through a police officer's head, Classic ! And it gets better, we even see an arm getting ripped off, brilliant. Zane brings out some demon sidekicks, really ugly looking bastards, but they look cool, to get into the hotel and attack. The lame thing is, that you need to shoot 'em in the eyes to kill them, I've seen that before. What I also liked about this flick was how Zane tries to bribe everyone in change for their souls. Uncle Willy for example got into a dream-like scene where he was surrounded by dozens of women, topless ! Awe-some movie people. Zane as star, and Sadler respectively second playing a believable character on the run for his life and that off the entire world. We see fists through face punches, arms getting ripped off, explosions, blood, demons, boobies. This is a classic !

    Whoever reviewed this movie did a horrible job, because they forget to mention all the nudity throughout the movie. Right away at the beginning, they show a woman's exposed bosoms when she's in the bathtub. Later on in an illusion scene, a man is surrounded around dozens of topless ladies. This was a really great movie and I enjoyed watching it. I had a huge problem with all the female nudity in the movie. I came to this site to see if this movie contained any nudity and I was lied to. The content review on this site only mentioned that this movie only showed the side of a woman's breast. There was a scene when that did happen, but the person who wrote the content review must have walked out the room when the "real" nudity was being shown.

This guy just nails it, and is definitely the star in this movie. After a car crash with a big bang, Sadler makes a run for an old church converted into a bar. This will be set piece for the whole movie. We find out that Sadler has a mysterious Relic and Zane is a demon working as a collector trying to get the relic back to his masters. Because before the earth was created it was ruled by demons, and they had 7 keys to keep the planet in darkness. Then god came along and divided the keys and drove off the demons. The key Sadler holds is the last one they need to bring back eternal darkness. I know it sounds cheesy and it is, but it doesn't really matter. Inside the key is blood, which can be used to seal doors and windows to create a blood barricade so the demons can't enter, this idea always fascinated me and I remember playing as a kid with colored water to replicate this tool. This movie has it all. 8 People stuck in a bar getting attacked by the demons of darkness. You got your typical asshole Roach, the friendly old uncle Willy, local prostitute Cordelia, nerdy type guy Wally, big momma Irene and the young Jada Pinkett Smith adding some drama to this movie. But Billy Zane is king as the collector, an evil character with a laid back style and lots of twisted humor. After the first dull 15 minutes, sh!t will hit the fan when Zane just punches right through a police officer's head, Classic ! And it gets better, we even see an arm getting ripped off, brilliant. Zane brings out some demon sidekicks, really ugly looking bastards, but they look cool, to get into the hotel and attack. The lame thing is, that you need to shoot 'em in the eyes to kill them, I've seen that before. What I also liked about this flick was how Zane tries to bribe everyone in change for their souls. Uncle Willy for example got into a dream-like scene where he was surrounded by dozens of women, topless ! Awe-some movie people. Zane as star, and Sadler respectively second playing a believable character on the run for his life and that off the entire world. We see fists through face punches, arms getting ripped off, explosions, blood, demons, boobies. This is a classic !

    Whoever reviewed this movie did a horrible job, because they forget to mention all the nudity throughout the movie. Right away at the beginning, they show a woman's exposed bosoms when she's in the bathtub. Later on in an illusion scene, a man is surrounded around dozens of topless ladies. This was a really great movie and I enjoyed watching it. I had a huge problem with all the female nudity in the movie. I came to this site to see if this movie contained any nudity and I was lied to. The content review on this site only mentioned that this movie only showed the side of a woman's breast. There was a scene when that did happen, but the person who wrote the content review must have walked out the room when the "real" nudity was being shown.

    I much preferred the original to these types of movies like House of the Demons (all) and Demons 1&2. This movie is a cheesy Hollywood ripoff. The originals didn't have some stupid item that stole the importance from its characters. Its much more fun watching the characters running around not knowing how to deal with the situation than some cheesy cross artifact that lands right in their lap every time they're in a bit of a tangle. Predictable? Yes to the extreme which is why the originals pour crapola all over this tasteless ripoff. I'm rating this down cause so many idiots don't know a good movie when they see it.

    Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight is a forgotten and underrated gem. From the outset, the movie sets it pace as "all out" and doesn't let up. Being a TFTC title, of course it is filled with camp, but at it's heart this is just classic, good old fashioned horror fun. Billy Zane's performance as "The Collector" is one of his best and shows his chops as something more than just another handsome guy. Also strong is William Sadler - here taking a break from his oft-played redneck roles and delivering a surprisingly deep character in Brayker. The entire ensemble is made up of terrific actors and, even in a campy horror movie, they give strong performances. the story itself felt different, and not simply a retread of other horror flicks. It has a certain cleverness and wit that I find is missing in many movies of it's type. If i were going to categorize this I'd place it closer to "The Cabin In The Woods" or "From Duck 'Til Dawn" than i would "Dead Alive" or the "Saw" films. One could say it was overdone in parts, or too campy, but they'd be missing the point. This is a "Tales From The Crypt" movie, after all, and a touch of the eccentric and camp is to be expected. There is more to this movie than meets the eye and, if one goes into with an open mind, they will be rewarded with one HELL of a ride. Overall, I thought TFTC: Demon Knight was unorthodox in it's approach and handled well in terms of the balance between camp, horror, comedy, and drama. The acting and actors are strong and play sit straight, despite it's tone and topic. The effects are great, including some innovative design work, and the soundtrack is still good to this day. I recommend this one to any horror fan.

    Billy Zane, William Sadler, Jada Pinkett, Thomas Haden Church, Charles Fleischer, CCH Pounder, Brenda Bakke and Dick Miller star in this 1995 horror film based on the TV series and horror comics. This begins with the infamous Crypt Keeper (Voiced by John Kassir) directing a cheesy horror film before presenting this tale. It begins with a man, Brayker (Sadler) who is chased by a collector (Zane) while driving on a long stretch of road. Brayker is able to get away from him and comes to a run-down motel where the residents are about to be in for a nightmare. Soon, The collector comes and reveals himself as a demon trying to get hold of an ancient key that Brayker possesses. Brayker is also revealed to be a Demon Knight who tries to protect them from him and search for the next chosen one who will fight the forces of evil. Pinkett plays Jeryline, Fleischer (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) plays square postman, Wally, Bakke (Hot Shots! Part Deux) plays prostitute, Cordelia who Wally likes, Church (Spider-Man 3) plays her rotten boyfriend, Roach, Pounder (End Of Days) plays Irene, the owner of the motel and Miller (Gremlins) plays drunk, Willy. This is a good 90's horror flick and Zane and Sadler are great in it. I recommend this.

    Demon Knight is a B movie that shouldn't be underestimated. Taking its ques from the hit-or-miss HBO series "Tales From the Crypt", Demon Knight is a horror movie that never takes itself too seriously and has a lot of positive going for it. As a "horror" movie, it is boiler plate, average, run of the mill. But, the self aware gags it has with itself, the decent effects, and the interesting development and pace it takes sets it above the crap you might expect. A masterpiece this is not, but it's fun, can be dark and serious, and has it's humor when needed. Also, this movie is worth the watch just for Billy Zane alone. And if you say Bordello of Blood is better than this movie, your sarcasm is appreciated.

    "DEMON KNIGHT" is a criminally underrated masterpiece of 1990s B-cinema; I argue that it stands with other genre siblings like THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS and DEAD ALIVE as an overlooked gem composed of everything enjoyable about the horror movie experience. DK is incredibly fun. Bloody, gory, goofy fun, but it's also quite surprising. It accepts its limitations, both financial and thematic (due to being a "Tales From the Crypt" project) and embraces them with all the enthusiasm and grandeur it deserves and some that it doesn't. It accepts that its premise is fundamentally far-fetched, but also accepts that to the characters, its nothing short of completely real, and so the story and the cast treats it as such and that is what sets it above other, disappointing kitsch horror films that stray into the meta or take themselves overwhelmingly seriously for an underwhelming concept. What sells this film more than anything else is the cast; it's a testament to the craft to watch them work here. They never wink to the audience or treat the material with disdain, but instead, give it all they have (without veering into parody or kabuki), and that sells the importance necessary to invest in the characters and care about their plight. Virtually everyone in this film except Dick Miller is cast against type, and given a character in stark contrast with the ones they are usually given in films and TV outside. The most notable is Thomas Haden Church, who devastates his charming, adorable iconic role of Lowell in "Wings" as the loathsome, irredeemable, belligerent Roach. Sadler in particular is affecting as Brayker, who is a character of such quiet dignity and resignation that I truly wonder why he hasn't been offered more roles like this since. The true standout, however, is Billy Zane, who has such unparalleled charisma and humor that had this film been recognized at its time for its greatness, Zane would be remembered for The Collector and not for TITANIC. Zane's performance as The Collector is nothing less than on par with Christoph Waltz's Landa in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. If that sounds like hyperbole, then you have yet to see the evidence to the contrary. You really can't go wrong as a horror movie fan, casual or serious, with giving this film a go. Even if you don't find it to be your cup of tea, you'd be hard pressed to argue that it wasn't worth your time. DEMON KNIGHT is actually worthy of your time. Give it a shot.

    This is one of my all time favorite movies, and it's the very first movie I saw more than twice while still in theaters. I was already a fan of Tales from the Crypt, and with this movie, there were constant thrills from beginning to end, and everyone was involved in causing those thrills. This was also the very first movie I ever saw Jada Pinkett in--I had never even heard of her before; I absolutely loved her part, and I was already a William Sadler fan from having seen him in Die Hard 2. From beginning to end, the action & suspense keeps you rolling right along on the edge of your seat! The bottom line is this is a movie that I absolutely love, & I have seen it more than 20 times already. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was that it took about 8-10 minutes or so for the actual movie to start. : )

    "Demon Knight," the first film adaptation of the hit HBO series, "Tales from the Crypt," finds a drifter (William Sadler) on the run from a clan of demons and their mysterious and maniacal ringleader (Billy Zane). Holed up in a sleazy, run-down hotel, the drifter joins forces with a mix of jerks, half-wits, under-achievers and hussies in an effort to stave off the evil forces at bay just outside their doorstep. In keeping with the series it's based off of, "Demon Knight" is quite simply a boatload of good gory horror fun. Filled to the rafters with over-the-top action, zany characters and colorful gore and special effects, it's a rare treat in the otherwise desolate wasteland that is 90's horror. The cast is really a big part of what carries the film, though. Billy Zane plays the charismatic bad guy superbly, while Sadler underplays his role a bit by comparison. Jada Pinkett has a noteworthy part as a Sarah Connor-type tough-girl who saves the day. Thomas Haden Church hams it up and gives Zane a run for his money with some of the film's most quotable lines. Director Ernest Dickerson puts on a dazzling show but knows well enough not to take the material too seriously and the film is all the better for it. Not only does the film look good, but it delivers exactly the type of thrills that horror fans who love a little humor thrown in the mix can appreciate. Unfortunately, the funhouse thrills wear off somewhere in the second half when the film attempts to expand its meager plot. Truth be told, the film is a lot more fun when we know next to nothing about the main characters or their motives. Even still, though, one can't help but be bowled over by the delightfully cheesy yet thrilling fun-fest that the film delivers. From its excellent and eclectic ensemble cast to its heavy metal soundtrack featuring the likes of Pantera and Filter, "Demon Knight" is an offer no fun-loving horror fan can refuse.

    I saw this movie for the first time around 13 years ago, I was just a kid. Back in the day me and my dad went to Videoland every 2 weeks or so and rented 10 flicks at a time for a week, VHS off course. For my age ( around 10 ) I was interested in very different movies then my classmates or friends. I always picked out action, ninja and horror movies, like Commando, Gremlins, Highway to Hell etc. This time I picked Demon Knight, as well as 9 other movies which off course I can't remember. But the funny thing is, I never watched a single one of them. Yes people, for 7 days straight I was sucked into Demon Knight. I was so impressed by this movie back then, that I watched it like 15 times in 1 week. For me this movie is a cult classic and is one of my favorite movies of all time. I grew older, so I know a "good" movie is something like Godfather or the Dark Knight ( generally speaking ) but the memories from this movie from when I was a kid are still engraved into my mind and I can watch it anytime with full enjoyment. Sorry for the small back story but I really wanted to try and tell why I love this freaking movie. This movie starts off with a drifter named Brayker ( William Sadler ) trying to get away from a cowboy-like dude called The Collector, which is a role meant to be played by Billy Zane. This guy just nails it, and is definitely the star in this movie. After a car crash with a big bang, Sadler makes a run for an old church converted into a bar. This will be set piece for the whole movie. We find out that Sadler has a mysterious Relic and Zane is a demon working as a collector trying to get the relic back to his masters. Because before the earth was created it was ruled by demons, and they had 7 keys to keep the planet in darkness. Then god came along and divided the keys and drove off the demons. The key Sadler holds is the last one they need to bring back eternal darkness. I know it sounds cheesy and it is, but it doesn't really matter. Inside the key is blood, which can be used to seal doors and windows to create a blood barricade so the demons can't enter, this idea always fascinated me and I remember playing as a kid with colored water to replicate this tool. This movie has it all. 8 People stuck in a bar getting attacked by the demons of darkness. You got your typical asshole Roach, the friendly old uncle Willy, local prostitute Cordelia, nerdy type guy Wally, big momma Irene and the young Jada Pinkett Smith adding some drama to this movie. But Billy Zane is king as the collector, an evil character with a laid back style and lots of twisted humor. After the first dull 15 minutes, sh!t will hit the fan when Zane just punches right through a police officer's head, Classic ! And it gets better, we even see an arm getting ripped off, brilliant.

The lame thing is, that you need to shoot 'em in the eyes to kill them, I've seen that before. What I also liked about this flick was how Zane tries to bribe everyone in change for their souls. Uncle Willy for example got into a dream-like scene where he was surrounded by dozens of women, topless ! Awe-some movie people. Zane as star, and Sadler respectively second playing a believable character on the run for his life and that off the entire world. We see fists through face punches, arms getting ripped off, explosions, blood, demons, boobies. This is a classic !
