    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

    What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected. Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements. Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    The other day I was sitting on the couch with my mother and she turns on Heathers. I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.

    An Excellent,Funny Teen Black Comedy,One Of The Best Teen Films Of All Time And True Classic.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.

    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

    What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected. Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements. Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    The other day I was sitting on the couch with my mother and she turns on Heathers. I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.

    An Excellent,Funny Teen Black Comedy,One Of The Best Teen Films Of All Time And True Classic.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.

    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    The other day I was sitting on the couch with my mother and she turns on Heathers. I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.

    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

    What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected. Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements. Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.

    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

    What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected. Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements. Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    The other day I was sitting on the couch with my mother and she turns on Heathers. I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.

    An Excellent,Funny Teen Black Comedy,One Of The Best Teen Films Of All Time And True Classic.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.

    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

    What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected. Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements. Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    The other day I was sitting on the couch with my mother and she turns on Heathers. I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.

    An Excellent,Funny Teen Black Comedy,One Of The Best Teen Films Of All Time And True Classic.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.

    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

    What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected. Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements. Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    The other day I was sitting on the couch with my mother and she turns on Heathers. I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.

    An Excellent,Funny Teen Black Comedy,One Of The Best Teen Films Of All Time And True Classic.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.

    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

    What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected. Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements. Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    The other day I was sitting on the couch with my mother and she turns on Heathers. I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.

    An Excellent,Funny Teen Black Comedy,One Of The Best Teen Films Of All Time And True Classic.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.

    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

    What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected. Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements. Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    The other day I was sitting on the couch with my mother and she turns on Heathers. I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.

    An Excellent,Funny Teen Black Comedy,One Of The Best Teen Films Of All Time And True Classic.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.

    Winona Ryder plays Veronica Sawyer, who is an uneasy member of a clique of High School girls(all named Heather) who are good-looking but really cruel and spoiled. One day, a new student named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) comes to school, and he is a breath of fresh air to her, being a rebel unconcerned with what others think of him, and who stands up for himself. They begin a relationship, but when one of the Heathers is accidentally killed, they pass it off as a suicide, only to be shocked that this makes her even more popular! More "suicides" are then arranged, as events escalate out of control... Wickedly funny satire for a while(that confrontation in the cafeteria between J.D. and the jock is uproarious.), and both leads are excellent, especially Slater doing a canny Jack Nicholson imitation. It is therefore such a pity that the film gets cold feet and compromises its integrity by reversing itself at the end. If you're going to tell such a bold satire, you really should follow it through to its conclusion, which this film fails to do, which is a shame.

    Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths. Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film. The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

    What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected. Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements. Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously ("that's deep, huh?"). That's when you know something's wrong. Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.

    The other day I was sitting on the couch with my mother and she turns on Heathers. I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.

    Heathers is one of the best Comedies of all time and also one of the best Teen films of all time that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,hilarious Black Comedy,a sharp,well-written screenplay and a beautiful,haunting score. All of those things make Heathers not only a Cult Classic,Teen Classic or a Comedy Classic but a film classic as well. Heathers tells the story of Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder),a high school teenager that runs with snobby popular girls called Heathers,Heather Duke(Shannon Dorothy),Heather McNamara,(Lisanne Falk)and the leader Heather Chandler(Kim Walker). Tired of the popular cliques,Veronica meets and falls for rebel Jason Dean(Christian Slater)who comes up with a bizarre solution:murder the popular kids and make them look like suicides. This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean. Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic. The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well. The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann. The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack. In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right. The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively. Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add. Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars

    Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself. Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake "society" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to "escape" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become. Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of "Heathers." With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," or even "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, "Heathers" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like "Weird Science," where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, "Heathers" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, "Heathers" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.

    Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, "Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven," 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, "Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?" and, "She was my best friend and worst enemy," Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a "Crazy psychotic ending." There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a "friendly" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, "plastics." Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious. Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder," Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.

    Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny. So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any "good guys" left here. The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the "suicides" at Westerberg High climbs. Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clich&eacute;s of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread. Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers. It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy. Where's the Michael Lehman/Daniel Waters of this generation? We need him more than ever.

    Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction. For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.
