  Marvin Bookman is a small shop owner in Gary, Indiana, USA. After he sees a drive-by shooting of Laurie Thompson's son by a local gang, he gives up the license number of the car to the police. The gang doesn't like this so they go to the store and rough him up. Soon, John Bookman comes to town to set the wrong things right. With the help of Laurie and his old friend Jake, they attempt to take back the streets and show the new breed of gang members what the true originals can do.

    On the surface Original GANGSTAS insinuates it's going to be a tough , gritty vigilante thriller set in the ghetto with a bunch of law abiding citizens taking on some nasty gang bangers . At it's most vague and basic this is exactly what it is . But remember one thing - the cast list . Who's appearing . We've got Richard Roundtree , Jim Brown , Ron O' Neal , Pam Grier and Fred Williamson basically every mainstay from the blaxploitation movies from the 1970s . And this is how the movie plays out . In effect you're watching a sequel to all these funky movies from the 1970s , produced for white people for black people . Even the title of the movie has undertones of a follow up to these 70s movies The problem is that by the 1990s had come along Tarantino was the pin up boy of American cinema . We were now in the era of post modernism - some might claim post , post modernism - and watching OG you're struck by the lack of self referential concepts behind the proceedings . It also goes against the grain of other movies such as MENACE 2 SOCIETY in that there's a lack of anti-gangsta subtext and any social commentary is loosely touched upon and shallow . In effect it's straight forward vigilante wish fulfillment while being enjoyable to a degree certainly belongs in another era

    As somebody who lives in the city just West of Gary, I can tell you that it does exist and is in worse shape than the movie portrayed. The gangs may be different but crime is still rampant. A lot of the buildings in the movie are still there, in worse shape than what was in the movie and they still film there when they want to show a disaster zone. The city relied too heavily on the former U.S. Steel to support it. As the mill downsized and other industry moved out,"White Flight" and corrupt politicians began the death knell. There are a lot of good people there who are trying to make things better, but aren't having a lot of success. It's really a shame, it was a beautiful city at one time. I did enjoy the movie enough to watch it a couple times.

    This is a powerful film and I hope you see it. Caught it here recently on THIS TV Network, so likely it will come around again. The opening scenes of Gary, Indiana present as an arresting message of what happens to prosperity when do-gooders, Wowsers, Uplifters, Eco-messiahs, Carrie Nations, lunatics, and other chronic nuisances chase industry and jobs away in the name of saving something or other. Plants close and shortly rust. People quit their homes and leave them to face nature's relentless onslaught along with the thugs who move in and make them into Den's of iNiquity. Richard Roundtree, Fred Williamson, Ron 'Superfly' O'Neil, they're all here along with the great Pam Grier, Jim Brown - Captain Anders in 1968's "Ice Station Zebra", along with the late and very much missed Paul Winfield who evinced touching cinemagic in 'Green Eyes'. Even if you don't enjoy films in general, let alone the Blaxploitation genre, anyone who's into UE, Urban Exploration, sometimes called Industrial Archaeology - and if you're not, you should be - you'll swoon as serial images of one decrevalent building after another after oxydizing blast furnace after abandoned ten storeys-high heat stoves march across your screen. Yes, Gary, Indiana in "Original Gangstas" is prime Urban Exploration territory. The film's message is poignant as ever: Don't incite people, particularly those wise in years, to righteous indignation. It's an unwise practice to do so. Be sure to watch for the David Lynch-esquire visual anachronisms, e.g. the film takes place in 1996, yet many police cruisers hail from the 80s as well as the 90s. The Gangstas drive cars whose model years span a fifty year period, thus keeping you off balance until the stunning conclusion. The wry humor, "there goes the neighborhood", will catch you off guard as well, and send you tumb-bumbling off the couch, onto the floor, and scurrying to your video store for your own copy of "Original Gangstas". If you don't own a copy of this, you should. Now. So do it. Now. Paul Vincent Zecchino Manasota Key, Florida 11 October, 2010

    You have to wonder who this movie was aimed at, since it shows a bunch of old dudes killing young gang members, bad mouthing them and telling them to behave. (One half expects Fred "the Hammer" to strap one of the youths over his knee and dole out a spanking!) The young listen to "horrible" rap and the old listen to old soul songs. The old talk more "white" and the young are more into hood culture and talk slang. It may be valuable as an explication of generation gaps in black culture. The film itself is a pretty silly action film that lacks the inspiration of its 70's genre film forebears. The action takes place mostly in the dark and you cant see much of whats going on. There are some big explosions that look pretty good though. The soundtrack is made up of dated new jack stylings, not as lively or memorable as "Coffy is the color of her skin" or "the Slaughter theme". Disappointingly, Pam Grier is given second banana status and doesn't kick that much ass, or sexily vamp it up like she did in her 70s classics. She is a dutiful member of the family/crew. The movie explores issues of race, class, urban decay and gang violence in a ham-fisted, unconvincing way. Worth seeing for the blaxploitation completists out there, but not a priority for anyone with a passing interest in the genre. The DVD has a disappointing non-anamorphic transfer.

    John Bookman (Fred Williamson) returns to his home town which is now over run by gangs. His father is attacked and John wants to clean up the city. He enlists two old friends to help--Laurie (Pam Grier) and Jake (Jim Brown). But the gang leader is a borderline psycho and won't let go of the city. Bookman realizes they're going to have to fight to win. This was just made to get some of the best stars from the 1970s blaxploitation films together to kick a** like they did back then! Aside from Williamson, Grier and Brown we also get Ron O'Neal and Richard Roundtree popping up in small roles. And it's always good to see Paul Winfield, Isabel Sanford and Robert Forster (before his big comeback in 1997's "Jackie Brown"--with Grier). The basic plot is OK but there are some serious mistakes made. As the movie goes on the plot gets increasingly stupid (Williamson's "plan" to pit the gangs against each other causes killings and huge property destruction) and there are plenty of loopholes. There's some great action sequences but (even for this type of movie) it's far too violent. Seeing old people and children attacked or killed is just going too far. Still it's great to see these actors in action again. Grier easily gives the best performance--but I was surprised at how really good Williamson and Brown were. This gets a 7 just for the cast. Worth catching...just don't think about it too much.

    Original Gangstas (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Blaxploitation in the 90's has a street gang killing off people so the old guys (Fred Williamson, Jim Brown, Pam Grier, Ron O'Neal, Richard Roundtree) come to take the streets back. This all-star extravaganza remains a lot of fun like those films of the 1970's but this one here also has a message and asks a lot of serious questions. Whereas those 70's flicks simply blamed white folks, this one here goes a lot deeper in its message and even throws blame towards those earlier films. A lot of interesting ideas are brought up here, although we still get some mindless, if fun, action. Larry Cohen wrote a brilliant script and the performers all do a fine job. Robert Forster also stars.

    I found the concept of this film irresistible. Who wouldn't want to see Fred Williamson, Jim Brown and Pam Grier -- they of '70s blaxploitation action fame -- back kickin' some butt again. Unfortunately, ORIGINAL GANGSTAS doesn't live up expectations. The plot sees cigar-chompin' Williamson returning home after his elderly father is nearly killed by thugs for giving police information on a deadly drive-by. Freddy soon teams up with Brown and Grier for some vigilante justice that comes far too little, too late for the viewer. After a reasonably strong start, the film unravels in a myriad of awful dialog, uninteresting subplots and a lack of action. If you're looking for a better film about an aging vigilante, try the later DEATH WISH entries.

    It's like old home wee when stars like Jim Brown (Slaughter, Black Gunn), Fred Williamson (Starsky & Hutch), Pam Grier, Ron O'Neal (Superfly), Richard Roundtree (Shaft), and Paul Winfield (Sounder) get together to teach some young punks a lesson. Heavys of the 70's blaxploitation genre are called home to get some revenge and clean up the town. Lots of talking and shooting and good old fashioned fisticuffs. Pam Grier (Coffy, Foxy Brown) is back in the form we like. She was one of the first female action stars in Hollywood. Looking forward to a retrospective this weekend when they replay two of her best.

    "Original Gangstas" is a movie written by Aubrey Rattan and directed by Larry Cohen, released by the now-defunct Orion Pictures (now part of MGM) and Po' Boy Productions. This movie leads with an all-star cast staring Fred Williamson, Jim Brown, Pam Grier, the late Paul Winfield ("Sounder", "King"), Charles Napier, Wings Hauser, Robert Forster, the late Ron O'Neal ("Superfly"), the late Isabel Sanford (Louise on "The Jeffersons), and Richard Roundtree of "Shaft". With Christopher B. Duncan ("The Jamie Foxx Show"), Eddie Bo Smith, Jr., and Dru Down. In an urban Gary, Indiana. From a drive-by-shooting, to a attempted murder of grocery-store owner Marvin Bookman (Oscar Brown Jr.), John Bookman (Williamson) comes back and reunites with his friends and gets revenge on the gang they created years back. I give it 10/10.

    Original Gangstas is a pretty good film in some parts. The action sequences are pretty bad, as the shots are usually from far away and you see gun muzzle flashes that look fake and are not very convincing. People fall off buildings, but where are the close-ups of some bad guy getting shot a few times as the bullets rip through the body and the blood splatters? Most of the fight scenes are almost in pitch black lighting, so not much can be seen. It seems like a sheer miracle that anybody could get shot in the middle of dark alleys with lots of garbage dumpsters and other junk to provide cover for both sides. Original Gangstas reunites the greatest African American action stars of the 1970s, but they are hardly used. Fred Williamson was a producer and he is the only star in Original Gangstas. He spends most of the movie preaching to the neighborhood residents about fighting back against the drug gangs in Gary, Indiana (his real home town). However, the concept of middle-aged and elderly folks fighting with baseball bats against youths armed with AK-47s, Uzis, and M-16s seems like reckless advice. Some of the sillier scenes in this film have gangs attacking a shopping area and a bunch of people come out of the stores armed with bats and mop sticks and beat up the thugs who are armed with Uzis and could have mowed down the entire crowd in seconds. After various armed confrontations and shoot-outs, the thugs, hoodlums, and killers who are subdued are given a stern warning by Fred Williamson to "stop being bad" and then these criminals are told to "go home." Presumably they have been "saved." Jim Brown is in this film primarily as Fred Williamson's sidekick, which seems wrong to me. The late Ron O'Neal and the late Paul Winfield have very small roles, as does Richard Roundtree. Pam Grier at least gets a couple of good scenes. Original Gangstas has an incredible cast (including the late Isabel Sanford and Oscar Brown, Jr.) and yet this cast is pretty much wasted. With this cast, it would have been great to do an urban version of "The Dirty Dozen" or some story which used all the characters and provided a good message while providing the aging stars in nostalgic positive roles that reminded us of what had made them stars in the 1970s. Original Gangstas is an interesting movie, but you will soon see how it could have been a great film. Original Gangstas could have been like The Professionals or The Wild Bunch which both put a group aging stars together into some great roles. While Original Gangstas does not succeed in bringing one last great Hurrah to these stars, at least the effort to put them together was made. Too bad that a sorry screenplay and a pathetic director submarined their efforts.

    Original Gangstas is a pretty good film in some parts. The action sequences are pretty bad, as the shots are usually from far away and you see gun muzzle flashes that look fake and are not very convincing. People fall off buildings, but where are the close-ups of some bad guy getting shot a few times as the bullets rip through the body and the blood splatters? Most of the fight scenes are almost in pitch black lighting, so not much can be seen. It seems like a sheer miracle that anybody could get shot in the middle of dark alleys with lots of garbage dumpsters and other junk to provide cover for both sides. Original Gangstas reunites the greatest African American action stars of the 1970s, but they are hardly used. Fred Williamson was a producer and he is the only star in Original Gangstas. He spends most of the movie preaching to the neighborhood residents about fighting back against the drug gangs in Gary, Indiana (his real home town). However, the concept of middle-aged and elderly folks fighting with baseball bats against youths armed with AK-47s, Uzis, and M-16s seems like reckless advice. Some of the sillier scenes in this film have gangs attacking a shopping area and a bunch of people come out of the stores armed with bats and mop sticks and beat up the thugs who are armed with Uzis and could have mowed down the entire crowd in seconds. After various armed confrontations and shoot-outs, the thugs, hoodlums, and killers who are subdued are given a stern warning by Fred Williamson to "stop being bad" and then these criminals are told to "go home." Presumably they have been "saved." Jim Brown is in this film primarily as Fred Williamson's sidekick, which seems wrong to me. The late Ron O'Neal and the late Paul Winfield have very small roles, as does Richard Roundtree. Pam Grier at least gets a couple of good scenes. Original Gangstas has an incredible cast (including the late Isabel Sanford and Oscar Brown, Jr.) and yet this cast is pretty much wasted. With this cast, it would have been great to do an urban version of "The Dirty Dozen" or some story which used all the characters and provided a good message while providing the aging stars in nostalgic positive roles that reminded us of what had made them stars in the 1970s. Original Gangstas is an interesting movie, but you will soon see how it could have been a great film. Original Gangstas could have been like The Professionals or The Wild Bunch which both put a group aging stars together into some great roles. While Original Gangstas does not succeed in bringing one last great Hurrah to these stars, at least the effort to put them together was made. Too bad that a sorry screenplay and a pathetic director submarined their efforts.
