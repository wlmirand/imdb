    It's dangerous to remake anything with Audrey Hepburn because no one can compare to her. This movie is a case in point. Julia Ormond is a good actress but she isn't suited to this role because she has a harder look about her and just doesn't have Audrey's sophisticated delicate sweetness. Few do. These were impossible shoes to fill. Greg Kinnear doesn't have William Holden's devilish charm. That's why he is an excellent supporting actor but not a romantic lead. Harrison Ford is ill at ease in romantic roles. He's reached the Clint Eastwood Robert Redford stage - time to go behind the screen. Don't watch this one just stick to the original.

    There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a good film. With fine actors and performances. But, no matter how wonderful he is, Harrison Ford is not Humphrey Bogart. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn. And Greg Kinnear is not William Holden. And I think the difference is most easily seen between Bogart and Ford. Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Bogart often wasn't (but every once in a while he was magnificent). But there was something very special and unique about Bogart in the original. Perhaps that it was so against type...making the transformation at the end so much more stunning. But just because you put a pair of professor-style glasses on Harrison Ford, doesn't mean you make him not-sexy (at least nearly 20 years ago when this film was made). People often ask is the story the same in the old and new versions. Superficially, yes. But in reality, there is a key difference. In the Bogart/Hepburn version, Bogart rather suddenly realizes he is in love with Sabrina. In this version, the love grows gradually and is fully realized by Harrison Ford...and confuses him. Another difference, in my view, is what each film "is". This version is a romance movie. The older version was a fairy tale. Harrison Ford is excellent here, and it occurred to me several times while watching the film that it's too bad we didn't see him more often in romantic roles during this career. Julia Ormond was excellent, as well, and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen much of her in recent years...but in looking it up I see that she has remained busy, but mostly not in leading roles. Greg Kinnear was one of those actors who kinda snuck up on me; this was his first significant role, and it made me realize that he was much more talented than I would have thought based on my former experiences seeing him on "Talk Soup". Angie Dickinson has a "nothing" role as the mother of "the other woman", and Richard Crenna's role as the father of the "other woman" was probably the least impressive work he has ever done on celluloid; he was really a very talented supporting actor. It was always a treat seeing Nancy Marchand in a film, and no exception to that here. John Wood as Sabrina's father...very good. A real gem of a performance, which may be often overlooked, is that of Dana Ivey, the secretary! I recommend both the original and this remake, although I doubt the remake will end up being the classic that the original was.

    I've seen the 1954 version and this one and liked them both; although, I liked this one better. Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond do a good job playing the uptight business obsessed Linus, and Sabrina, the chauffeur's daughter. This is escapist romance at its best. Sabrina is totally infatuated with David, the younger son on the Long Island Larabie estate. She has watched and adored him for years from a perch in the tree near the chauffeur's quarters. Her father sends her to Paris hoping the experience will broaden her horizons and cure her of this obsession. When she comes back, she encounter's David in all her new Paris sophistication. What will be the result? The film is beautifully directed by Sydney Pollack. The dialogue is witty, the acting very well done. Please rent "Sabrina." You won't be disappointed.

    I couldn't even watch to the end and had to stop in the middle - which I usually never do for a movie or a book. Everything seemed dull. - Julia Ormond: is sad and ugly, even when she is supposedly that new fashionable woman back from Paris. She doesn't have the playfulness and liveliness or even half of the class and sense of style and fashion of the original (and she is supposed to have worked at Vogue). Her evening dress at the Larabee's party? blah... Her haircut makes her look too mature and in her late 30's (The girl playing E. Tyson was much more attractive and young) and I wasn't impressed with her character transformation. The way that transformation occurs isn't even that detailed or deep, as the assistant photographer. In the original, it is not deep or detailed either, but at least it is done in a fun, lighthearted way at the cooking school. - the dialogs:they were painful, dull and the self-awareness with which the lines were delivered made my skin crawl. The scene where Sabrina talks about her feelings to a hidden Linus before going to Paris was delivered with lackluster and a sadness that were painful to watch. I felt ashamed for Ormond. I missed the way Audrey Hepburn inhales with delight the deadly fumes of the cars, or even the simple goodbye letter she writes to her father. - I felt sad for Harrison Ford, because I usually like him very much and think he was not exactly miscast, but lost with all these sad characters to deal with in the first place. - I didn't feel any chemistry with the characters. That young man in Paris who falls in love with Sabrina doesn't even make sense. Why fall for such a clumsy ugly girl who can't say a word straight? What is their link, except for their jobs? What do they share in common? What is to be seen in her that makes her endearing? - In the old times, they knew how to suggest an atmosphere and a character in one shot. Today, we over explain. An example. In the old version, when we are first introduced to the Larabees, we see a painting of the family on the wall, then the family pausing for professional photographers. We know right there the pride, the arrogance of a rich family, the annoyed expression of Bogart, the delighted smile of his brother, the haughtiness of the mother etc.In the new version, we have a painfully long explanation of who is who, showing every character in turn. Another example? The ending, where Linus gets on the boat, asks for his hat to be arranged and sticks his umbrella on someone's coat belt, and we are meant to understand that he is at least on the same page as Sabrina. We don't need the again painful explanatory dialog of 10 minutes between the two leads. I could go on and on, scene by scene, from the chauffeur, to that round window showing the Eiffel tower and the french cook, to the beautiful ball dress Audrey is wearing and the witty short dialogs, the old version was a winner. The new version lacks subtlety and charm.

    Some people get very worked up over remakes of their favorite movies. I won't tell you that I particularly enjoy the experience; I don't. But as I watched this version of Sabrina, after having watched the previous one with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, it occurred to me - my mind was wandering - that remakes of movies, like the originals, are like different performances of a given play. No one, I hope, would argue, after having seen a great production of Hamlet or Macbeth, that those plays should not be done again by others. Of course, one could ask why do them if the new company doesn't have something to justify yet another production of them. But there's no reason to argue against further productions in principle. That's how I feel about this version of Sabrina. There are things that I particularly enjoyed in the previous version that I didn't like here. I was very aggravated that this Sabrina did not learn the lessons of self-confidence in Paris that her predecessor did: those lines are cut out of this script, and when she goes to the Larabee party after her return from Paris, this Sabrina is a bundle of nerves - she has not learned self-confidence. This movie is also more often funny than the previous version. That would be a plus for those who want to laugh more during a movie. So, in the end, for me this was not as enjoyable a performance of the story of Sabrina as the previous one. But that's because the aspects of the story that interest me aren't focused on in this version as they were in the previous one. For someone else who is looking for and enjoys different things, this version might have more to offer. And such a person might give it a higher rating.

    Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Gregg Kinnear star in a remake of a 50's movie, originally starring Humphrey Bogart, called Sabrina. I hate to say it but I never saw that movie. But I did see this movie. This is a great movie. It's funny, and definitely romantic. The actors do a fantastic job. Especially Harrison Ford, playing the more likable brother. Harrison ford and Greg Kinnear play two brothers named Linus and David, sons of a tycoon in New York. David is engaged to one of their business partner's daughter(played by Lauren Holly). But he changes his mind when Sabrina(played by Julia Ormond), the daughter of their car driver and an old friend, returns from Paris. When she returns, the two of them plan on meeting up in the solarium. But that leads to an accident involving David. David's brother Linus has always had a crush on her too. So he offers to talk to her after the accident. While David lays injured in bed, Linus starts to hang out with her, and she soon starts to fall for him. Sabrina is a fantastic film. Sydney Pollack did such a great job making this movie. It's a shame he's not alive anymore.Cause he did great films. This was an odd one, and what was he doing in Made of honor? Lord knows. All of the actors do a great job. These are great actors. This is a great film. Sabrina: A

    "Sabrina" is a pretty easily likable romantic comedy, a genre of which I am a fan, even though it is hard to find good ones. This is a decent film, but now that I am comparing it to the 1954 original, it is easier for me to be critical. This movie has a good plot, some humor, and decent romance. Also, I am pleased to find movies like this with so little objectionable content, making it appropriate for the whole family, though the younger ones may not be completely interested. I hate to complain about this movie, but there are a few downsides. It runs too long overall, and it slows down too much toward the end. If you ask me, Harrison Ford doesn't really fit his role and seems to old and lifeless for the part he is intending to play. Also, I'm afraid Greg Kinnear simply cannot fill the brilliance of William Holden's shoes in the original. Julia Ormond takes Audrey Hepburn's role fairly well, but none of these three can possibly compare to the excellence of the original cast. The old film really was not outdated and didn't need to be updated, as films like "The Shop Around the Corner" or "The Parent Trap" did. Despite those things, I'm not going to criticize this film any more. It's good for a date film or when you don't want to think too hard but just want to be entertained and happy. I give it a slight recommendation, but I'd suggest the original with more priority. *** out of ****

    Desultory remake of the Billy Wilder classic. Julia Ormond gets the Audrey Hepburn role, and while those are pretty big shoes to fill, she could have at least tried to give a more compelling performance than the listless one she actually gives. "Sabrina" doesn't really work if you spend the whole movie wondering why any man would want to bother with such a wet noodle. Of course, the same could be said for the Harrison Ford character as well -- who'd want to waste her time on such a fuddy-duddy when the uber-charming Greg Kinnear is waiting in the background? Though Kinnear's charm oozes out so thickly you can practically see it, he manages to stay just this side of smarmy, making you wish the movie was about him. There's no compelling reason to see this as long as the original is out there available to rent. Grade: C

    Will go back to reread some of the quality IMDb user comments here. A couple of high level commentators can be viewed---above... Is Mom (1954) or Daughter (1995) "SABRINA" better? While I like Daughter SABRINA a tad better---I love both. There are NO LOSERS in this gentle debate... Both SABRINA versions not only have quality leads---they have great supporting casts. Here, maybe I like 1995 SABRINA a bit more---since the supporting characters are more familiar to me... As I write this, Nancy Marchand (as the Larrabee Matriarch) has made yet another one of her dry quips... Angie Dickinson well portrays the emptyheaded once-trophy wife of David's fianc&eacute;e's equally wealthy family - with Richard Crenna as her husband - And Lauren Holly is the result of the Tyson merger of beauty to brains/wealth - the smart yet beautiful Elisabeth Tyson, MD. - the first sensible female that woman chasing younger brother David has ever fallen for!!! The dialogue in 1995 is silky, gently ironic...and hey...all you would be scriptwriters, movie producers, etc. Study BOTH SABRINAS for how to make quality romantic films. +++++ (NOTE Amazingly, only one (clothed) short pre bedroom scene is in the 1995 version. 99% of this movie succeeds with just great script, production, casting, acting!!! What a novel concept!) Don't waste too much time debating what essentially is personal preference over which wonderful visual desert (Sabrina 1954 or Sabrina 1995) is better....Just see both!!!

    I thoroughly enjoyed this film, having watched it at least 20 times. I regret that my DVD had no behind-the-scenes commentary from the actors or director that many films on DVD offer. It would be great to hear from Harrison Ford or Julia Ormond giving their insights on the film. Julia Ormond dominated this film in every scene she was in. Having watched it so many times, it becomes clear that Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were deliberately creating scenes that she could dominate. In essence, the two male leads were effectively supporting actors. This tactic was great for the film, but acting egos being what they are, not a common occurrence in Hollywood. Julia has not received such support in her other films that I have seen. Something bothered me about the plot of Sabrina that I could not put my finger on. Then it hit me. What did Sabrina do all day? She helped her chauffeur father polish the Rolls-Royce and nothing more. She did not attend college or work as a servant on the Larrabee estate. Perhaps she worked as a domestic for her father in his quarters. How could a woman with such great potential have no discernible ambition? It was interesting to watch how much effort the people working at Vogue magazine devoted to transforming the awkward Sabrina that arrived at their doorstep into a polished and sophisticated woman. These people really invested themselves in helping Sabrina become the beautiful and self-confident woman of the second half of the movie. No wonder David Larrabee didn't recognize Sabrina when she returned from Paris. Harrison Ford is delicious as the scheming Linus Larrabee who sets out to hustle the naive chauffeur's daughter Sabrina. He has been so effective in outmaneuvering his business rivals, Sabrina is dead meat in his opinion. We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived. Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved. Linus meanwhile has his own quandary. He has developed deep feelings for Sabrina and cannot bring himself to betray her for the sake of a large sum of money. He reveals the deception to her and a shattered Sabrina flees back to her beloved Paris where she had some happiness even with the loneliness she has suffered her whole life. Here is where the plot seems to slip. All Linus had to do was to keep his initial deception to himself and actually sweep Sabrina away to Paris. He could make a brief return to the USA to close the business deal and return to his love in Paris with her none the wiser. Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness. Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

    Some people get very worked up over remakes of their favorite movies. I won't tell you that I particularly enjoy the experience; I don't. But as I watched this version of Sabrina, after having watched the previous one with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, it occurred to me - my mind was wandering - that remakes of movies, like the originals, are like different performances of a given play. No one, I hope, would argue, after having seen a great production of Hamlet or Macbeth, that those plays should not be done again by others. Of course, one could ask why do them if the new company doesn't have something to justify yet another production of them. But there's no reason to argue against further productions in principle. That's how I feel about this version of Sabrina. There are things that I particularly enjoyed in the previous version that I didn't like here. I was very aggravated that this Sabrina did not learn the lessons of self-confidence in Paris that her predecessor did: those lines are cut out of this script, and when she goes to the Larabee party after her return from Paris, this Sabrina is a bundle of nerves - she has not learned self-confidence. This movie is also more often funny than the previous version. That would be a plus for those who want to laugh more during a movie. So, in the end, for me this was not as enjoyable a performance of the story of Sabrina as the previous one. But that's because the aspects of the story that interest me aren't focused on in this version as they were in the previous one. For someone else who is looking for and enjoys different things, this version might have more to offer. And such a person might give it a higher rating.

    Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Gregg Kinnear star in a remake of a 50's movie, originally starring Humphrey Bogart, called Sabrina. I hate to say it but I never saw that movie. But I did see this movie. This is a great movie. It's funny, and definitely romantic. The actors do a fantastic job. Especially Harrison Ford, playing the more likable brother. Harrison ford and Greg Kinnear play two brothers named Linus and David, sons of a tycoon in New York. David is engaged to one of their business partner's daughter(played by Lauren Holly). But he changes his mind when Sabrina(played by Julia Ormond), the daughter of their car driver and an old friend, returns from Paris. When she returns, the two of them plan on meeting up in the solarium. But that leads to an accident involving David. David's brother Linus has always had a crush on her too. So he offers to talk to her after the accident. While David lays injured in bed, Linus starts to hang out with her, and she soon starts to fall for him. Sabrina is a fantastic film. Sydney Pollack did such a great job making this movie. It's a shame he's not alive anymore.Cause he did great films. This was an odd one, and what was he doing in Made of honor? Lord knows. All of the actors do a great job. These are great actors. This is a great film. Sabrina: A

    "Sabrina" is a pretty easily likable romantic comedy, a genre of which I am a fan, even though it is hard to find good ones. This is a decent film, but now that I am comparing it to the 1954 original, it is easier for me to be critical. This movie has a good plot, some humor, and decent romance. Also, I am pleased to find movies like this with so little objectionable content, making it appropriate for the whole family, though the younger ones may not be completely interested. I hate to complain about this movie, but there are a few downsides. It runs too long overall, and it slows down too much toward the end. If you ask me, Harrison Ford doesn't really fit his role and seems to old and lifeless for the part he is intending to play. Also, I'm afraid Greg Kinnear simply cannot fill the brilliance of William Holden's shoes in the original. Julia Ormond takes Audrey Hepburn's role fairly well, but none of these three can possibly compare to the excellence of the original cast. The old film really was not outdated and didn't need to be updated, as films like "The Shop Around the Corner" or "The Parent Trap" did. Despite those things, I'm not going to criticize this film any more. It's good for a date film or when you don't want to think too hard but just want to be entertained and happy. I give it a slight recommendation, but I'd suggest the original with more priority. *** out of ****

    Desultory remake of the Billy Wilder classic. Julia Ormond gets the Audrey Hepburn role, and while those are pretty big shoes to fill, she could have at least tried to give a more compelling performance than the listless one she actually gives. "Sabrina" doesn't really work if you spend the whole movie wondering why any man would want to bother with such a wet noodle. Of course, the same could be said for the Harrison Ford character as well -- who'd want to waste her time on such a fuddy-duddy when the uber-charming Greg Kinnear is waiting in the background? Though Kinnear's charm oozes out so thickly you can practically see it, he manages to stay just this side of smarmy, making you wish the movie was about him. There's no compelling reason to see this as long as the original is out there available to rent. Grade: C

    Will go back to reread some of the quality IMDb user comments here. A couple of high level commentators can be viewed---above... Is Mom (1954) or Daughter (1995) "SABRINA" better? While I like Daughter SABRINA a tad better---I love both. There are NO LOSERS in this gentle debate... Both SABRINA versions not only have quality leads---they have great supporting casts. Here, maybe I like 1995 SABRINA a bit more---since the supporting characters are more familiar to me... As I write this, Nancy Marchand (as the Larrabee Matriarch) has made yet another one of her dry quips... Angie Dickinson well portrays the emptyheaded once-trophy wife of David's fianc&eacute;e's equally wealthy family - with Richard Crenna as her husband - And Lauren Holly is the result of the Tyson merger of beauty to brains/wealth - the smart yet beautiful Elisabeth Tyson, MD. - the first sensible female that woman chasing younger brother David has ever fallen for!!! The dialogue in 1995 is silky, gently ironic...and hey...all you would be scriptwriters, movie producers, etc. Study BOTH SABRINAS for how to make quality romantic films. +++++ (NOTE Amazingly, only one (clothed) short pre bedroom scene is in the 1995 version. 99% of this movie succeeds with just great script, production, casting, acting!!! What a novel concept!) Don't waste too much time debating what essentially is personal preference over which wonderful visual desert (Sabrina 1954 or Sabrina 1995) is better....Just see both!!!

    I thoroughly enjoyed this film, having watched it at least 20 times. I regret that my DVD had no behind-the-scenes commentary from the actors or director that many films on DVD offer. It would be great to hear from Harrison Ford or Julia Ormond giving their insights on the film. Julia Ormond dominated this film in every scene she was in. Having watched it so many times, it becomes clear that Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were deliberately creating scenes that she could dominate. In essence, the two male leads were effectively supporting actors. This tactic was great for the film, but acting egos being what they are, not a common occurrence in Hollywood. Julia has not received such support in her other films that I have seen. Something bothered me about the plot of Sabrina that I could not put my finger on. Then it hit me. What did Sabrina do all day? She helped her chauffeur father polish the Rolls-Royce and nothing more. She did not attend college or work as a servant on the Larrabee estate. Perhaps she worked as a domestic for her father in his quarters. How could a woman with such great potential have no discernible ambition? It was interesting to watch how much effort the people working at Vogue magazine devoted to transforming the awkward Sabrina that arrived at their doorstep into a polished and sophisticated woman. These people really invested themselves in helping Sabrina become the beautiful and self-confident woman of the second half of the movie. No wonder David Larrabee didn't recognize Sabrina when she returned from Paris. Harrison Ford is delicious as the scheming Linus Larrabee who sets out to hustle the naive chauffeur's daughter Sabrina. He has been so effective in outmaneuvering his business rivals, Sabrina is dead meat in his opinion. We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived. Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved. Linus meanwhile has his own quandary. He has developed deep feelings for Sabrina and cannot bring himself to betray her for the sake of a large sum of money. He reveals the deception to her and a shattered Sabrina flees back to her beloved Paris where she had some happiness even with the loneliness she has suffered her whole life. Here is where the plot seems to slip. All Linus had to do was to keep his initial deception to himself and actually sweep Sabrina away to Paris. He could make a brief return to the USA to close the business deal and return to his love in Paris with her none the wiser. Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness. Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

    It's dangerous to remake anything with Audrey Hepburn because no one can compare to her. This movie is a case in point. Julia Ormond is a good actress but she isn't suited to this role because she has a harder look about her and just doesn't have Audrey's sophisticated delicate sweetness. Few do. These were impossible shoes to fill. Greg Kinnear doesn't have William Holden's devilish charm. That's why he is an excellent supporting actor but not a romantic lead. Harrison Ford is ill at ease in romantic roles. He's reached the Clint Eastwood Robert Redford stage - time to go behind the screen. Don't watch this one just stick to the original.

    There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a good film. With fine actors and performances. But, no matter how wonderful he is, Harrison Ford is not Humphrey Bogart. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn. And Greg Kinnear is not William Holden. And I think the difference is most easily seen between Bogart and Ford. Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Bogart often wasn't (but every once in a while he was magnificent). But there was something very special and unique about Bogart in the original. Perhaps that it was so against type...making the transformation at the end so much more stunning. But just because you put a pair of professor-style glasses on Harrison Ford, doesn't mean you make him not-sexy (at least nearly 20 years ago when this film was made). People often ask is the story the same in the old and new versions. Superficially, yes. But in reality, there is a key difference. In the Bogart/Hepburn version, Bogart rather suddenly realizes he is in love with Sabrina. In this version, the love grows gradually and is fully realized by Harrison Ford...and confuses him. Another difference, in my view, is what each film "is". This version is a romance movie. The older version was a fairy tale. Harrison Ford is excellent here, and it occurred to me several times while watching the film that it's too bad we didn't see him more often in romantic roles during this career. Julia Ormond was excellent, as well, and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen much of her in recent years...but in looking it up I see that she has remained busy, but mostly not in leading roles. Greg Kinnear was one of those actors who kinda snuck up on me; this was his first significant role, and it made me realize that he was much more talented than I would have thought based on my former experiences seeing him on "Talk Soup". Angie Dickinson has a "nothing" role as the mother of "the other woman", and Richard Crenna's role as the father of the "other woman" was probably the least impressive work he has ever done on celluloid; he was really a very talented supporting actor. It was always a treat seeing Nancy Marchand in a film, and no exception to that here. John Wood as Sabrina's father...very good. A real gem of a performance, which may be often overlooked, is that of Dana Ivey, the secretary! I recommend both the original and this remake, although I doubt the remake will end up being the classic that the original was.

    I've seen the 1954 version and this one and liked them both; although, I liked this one better. Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond do a good job playing the uptight business obsessed Linus, and Sabrina, the chauffeur's daughter. This is escapist romance at its best. Sabrina is totally infatuated with David, the younger son on the Long Island Larabie estate. She has watched and adored him for years from a perch in the tree near the chauffeur's quarters. Her father sends her to Paris hoping the experience will broaden her horizons and cure her of this obsession. When she comes back, she encounter's David in all her new Paris sophistication. What will be the result? The film is beautifully directed by Sydney Pollack. The dialogue is witty, the acting very well done. Please rent "Sabrina." You won't be disappointed.

    I couldn't even watch to the end and had to stop in the middle - which I usually never do for a movie or a book. Everything seemed dull. - Julia Ormond: is sad and ugly, even when she is supposedly that new fashionable woman back from Paris. She doesn't have the playfulness and liveliness or even half of the class and sense of style and fashion of the original (and she is supposed to have worked at Vogue). Her evening dress at the Larabee's party? blah... Her haircut makes her look too mature and in her late 30's (The girl playing E. Tyson was much more attractive and young) and I wasn't impressed with her character transformation. The way that transformation occurs isn't even that detailed or deep, as the assistant photographer. In the original, it is not deep or detailed either, but at least it is done in a fun, lighthearted way at the cooking school. - the dialogs:they were painful, dull and the self-awareness with which the lines were delivered made my skin crawl. The scene where Sabrina talks about her feelings to a hidden Linus before going to Paris was delivered with lackluster and a sadness that were painful to watch. I felt ashamed for Ormond. I missed the way Audrey Hepburn inhales with delight the deadly fumes of the cars, or even the simple goodbye letter she writes to her father. - I felt sad for Harrison Ford, because I usually like him very much and think he was not exactly miscast, but lost with all these sad characters to deal with in the first place. - I didn't feel any chemistry with the characters. That young man in Paris who falls in love with Sabrina doesn't even make sense. Why fall for such a clumsy ugly girl who can't say a word straight? What is their link, except for their jobs? What do they share in common? What is to be seen in her that makes her endearing? - In the old times, they knew how to suggest an atmosphere and a character in one shot. Today, we over explain. An example. In the old version, when we are first introduced to the Larabees, we see a painting of the family on the wall, then the family pausing for professional photographers. We know right there the pride, the arrogance of a rich family, the annoyed expression of Bogart, the delighted smile of his brother, the haughtiness of the mother etc.In the new version, we have a painfully long explanation of who is who, showing every character in turn. Another example? The ending, where Linus gets on the boat, asks for his hat to be arranged and sticks his umbrella on someone's coat belt, and we are meant to understand that he is at least on the same page as Sabrina. We don't need the again painful explanatory dialog of 10 minutes between the two leads. I could go on and on, scene by scene, from the chauffeur, to that round window showing the Eiffel tower and the french cook, to the beautiful ball dress Audrey is wearing and the witty short dialogs, the old version was a winner. The new version lacks subtlety and charm.

David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived. Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved. Linus meanwhile has his own quandary. He has developed deep feelings for Sabrina and cannot bring himself to betray her for the sake of a large sum of money. He reveals the deception to her and a shattered Sabrina flees back to her beloved Paris where she had some happiness even with the loneliness she has suffered her whole life. Here is where the plot seems to slip. All Linus had to do was to keep his initial deception to himself and actually sweep Sabrina away to Paris. He could make a brief return to the USA to close the business deal and return to his love in Paris with her none the wiser. Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness. Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

    It's dangerous to remake anything with Audrey Hepburn because no one can compare to her. This movie is a case in point. Julia Ormond is a good actress but she isn't suited to this role because she has a harder look about her and just doesn't have Audrey's sophisticated delicate sweetness. Few do. These were impossible shoes to fill. Greg Kinnear doesn't have William Holden's devilish charm. That's why he is an excellent supporting actor but not a romantic lead. Harrison Ford is ill at ease in romantic roles. He's reached the Clint Eastwood Robert Redford stage - time to go behind the screen. Don't watch this one just stick to the original.

    There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a good film. With fine actors and performances. But, no matter how wonderful he is, Harrison Ford is not Humphrey Bogart. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn. And Greg Kinnear is not William Holden. And I think the difference is most easily seen between Bogart and Ford. Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Bogart often wasn't (but every once in a while he was magnificent). But there was something very special and unique about Bogart in the original. Perhaps that it was so against type...making the transformation at the end so much more stunning. But just because you put a pair of professor-style glasses on Harrison Ford, doesn't mean you make him not-sexy (at least nearly 20 years ago when this film was made). People often ask is the story the same in the old and new versions. Superficially, yes. But in reality, there is a key difference. In the Bogart/Hepburn version, Bogart rather suddenly realizes he is in love with Sabrina. In this version, the love grows gradually and is fully realized by Harrison Ford...and confuses him. Another difference, in my view, is what each film "is". This version is a romance movie. The older version was a fairy tale. Harrison Ford is excellent here, and it occurred to me several times while watching the film that it's too bad we didn't see him more often in romantic roles during this career. Julia Ormond was excellent, as well, and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen much of her in recent years...but in looking it up I see that she has remained busy, but mostly not in leading roles. Greg Kinnear was one of those actors who kinda snuck up on me; this was his first significant role, and it made me realize that he was much more talented than I would have thought based on my former experiences seeing him on "Talk Soup". Angie Dickinson has a "nothing" role as the mother of "the other woman", and Richard Crenna's role as the father of the "other woman" was probably the least impressive work he has ever done on celluloid; he was really a very talented supporting actor. It was always a treat seeing Nancy Marchand in a film, and no exception to that here. John Wood as Sabrina's father...very good. A real gem of a performance, which may be often overlooked, is that of Dana Ivey, the secretary! I recommend both the original and this remake, although I doubt the remake will end up being the classic that the original was.

    I've seen the 1954 version and this one and liked them both; although, I liked this one better. Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond do a good job playing the uptight business obsessed Linus, and Sabrina, the chauffeur's daughter. This is escapist romance at its best. Sabrina is totally infatuated with David, the younger son on the Long Island Larabie estate. She has watched and adored him for years from a perch in the tree near the chauffeur's quarters. Her father sends her to Paris hoping the experience will broaden her horizons and cure her of this obsession. When she comes back, she encounter's David in all her new Paris sophistication. What will be the result? The film is beautifully directed by Sydney Pollack. The dialogue is witty, the acting very well done. Please rent "Sabrina." You won't be disappointed.

    I couldn't even watch to the end and had to stop in the middle - which I usually never do for a movie or a book. Everything seemed dull. - Julia Ormond: is sad and ugly, even when she is supposedly that new fashionable woman back from Paris. She doesn't have the playfulness and liveliness or even half of the class and sense of style and fashion of the original (and she is supposed to have worked at Vogue). Her evening dress at the Larabee's party? blah... Her haircut makes her look too mature and in her late 30's (The girl playing E. Tyson was much more attractive and young) and I wasn't impressed with her character transformation. The way that transformation occurs isn't even that detailed or deep, as the assistant photographer. In the original, it is not deep or detailed either, but at least it is done in a fun, lighthearted way at the cooking school. - the dialogs:they were painful, dull and the self-awareness with which the lines were delivered made my skin crawl. The scene where Sabrina talks about her feelings to a hidden Linus before going to Paris was delivered with lackluster and a sadness that were painful to watch. I felt ashamed for Ormond. I missed the way Audrey Hepburn inhales with delight the deadly fumes of the cars, or even the simple goodbye letter she writes to her father. - I felt sad for Harrison Ford, because I usually like him very much and think he was not exactly miscast, but lost with all these sad characters to deal with in the first place. - I didn't feel any chemistry with the characters. That young man in Paris who falls in love with Sabrina doesn't even make sense. Why fall for such a clumsy ugly girl who can't say a word straight? What is their link, except for their jobs? What do they share in common? What is to be seen in her that makes her endearing? - In the old times, they knew how to suggest an atmosphere and a character in one shot. Today, we over explain. An example. In the old version, when we are first introduced to the Larabees, we see a painting of the family on the wall, then the family pausing for professional photographers. We know right there the pride, the arrogance of a rich family, the annoyed expression of Bogart, the delighted smile of his brother, the haughtiness of the mother etc.In the new version, we have a painfully long explanation of who is who, showing every character in turn. Another example? The ending, where Linus gets on the boat, asks for his hat to be arranged and sticks his umbrella on someone's coat belt, and we are meant to understand that he is at least on the same page as Sabrina. We don't need the again painful explanatory dialog of 10 minutes between the two leads. I could go on and on, scene by scene, from the chauffeur, to that round window showing the Eiffel tower and the french cook, to the beautiful ball dress Audrey is wearing and the witty short dialogs, the old version was a winner. The new version lacks subtlety and charm.

    Some people get very worked up over remakes of their favorite movies. I won't tell you that I particularly enjoy the experience; I don't. But as I watched this version of Sabrina, after having watched the previous one with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, it occurred to me - my mind was wandering - that remakes of movies, like the originals, are like different performances of a given play. No one, I hope, would argue, after having seen a great production of Hamlet or Macbeth, that those plays should not be done again by others. Of course, one could ask why do them if the new company doesn't have something to justify yet another production of them. But there's no reason to argue against further productions in principle. That's how I feel about this version of Sabrina. There are things that I particularly enjoyed in the previous version that I didn't like here. I was very aggravated that this Sabrina did not learn the lessons of self-confidence in Paris that her predecessor did: those lines are cut out of this script, and when she goes to the Larabee party after her return from Paris, this Sabrina is a bundle of nerves - she has not learned self-confidence. This movie is also more often funny than the previous version. That would be a plus for those who want to laugh more during a movie. So, in the end, for me this was not as enjoyable a performance of the story of Sabrina as the previous one. But that's because the aspects of the story that interest me aren't focused on in this version as they were in the previous one. For someone else who is looking for and enjoys different things, this version might have more to offer. And such a person might give it a higher rating.

    Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Gregg Kinnear star in a remake of a 50's movie, originally starring Humphrey Bogart, called Sabrina. I hate to say it but I never saw that movie. But I did see this movie. This is a great movie. It's funny, and definitely romantic. The actors do a fantastic job. Especially Harrison Ford, playing the more likable brother. Harrison ford and Greg Kinnear play two brothers named Linus and David, sons of a tycoon in New York. David is engaged to one of their business partner's daughter(played by Lauren Holly). But he changes his mind when Sabrina(played by Julia Ormond), the daughter of their car driver and an old friend, returns from Paris. When she returns, the two of them plan on meeting up in the solarium. But that leads to an accident involving David. David's brother Linus has always had a crush on her too. So he offers to talk to her after the accident. While David lays injured in bed, Linus starts to hang out with her, and she soon starts to fall for him. Sabrina is a fantastic film. Sydney Pollack did such a great job making this movie. It's a shame he's not alive anymore.Cause he did great films. This was an odd one, and what was he doing in Made of honor? Lord knows. All of the actors do a great job. These are great actors. This is a great film. Sabrina: A

    "Sabrina" is a pretty easily likable romantic comedy, a genre of which I am a fan, even though it is hard to find good ones. This is a decent film, but now that I am comparing it to the 1954 original, it is easier for me to be critical. This movie has a good plot, some humor, and decent romance. Also, I am pleased to find movies like this with so little objectionable content, making it appropriate for the whole family, though the younger ones may not be completely interested. I hate to complain about this movie, but there are a few downsides. It runs too long overall, and it slows down too much toward the end. If you ask me, Harrison Ford doesn't really fit his role and seems to old and lifeless for the part he is intending to play. Also, I'm afraid Greg Kinnear simply cannot fill the brilliance of William Holden's shoes in the original. Julia Ormond takes Audrey Hepburn's role fairly well, but none of these three can possibly compare to the excellence of the original cast. The old film really was not outdated and didn't need to be updated, as films like "The Shop Around the Corner" or "The Parent Trap" did. Despite those things, I'm not going to criticize this film any more. It's good for a date film or when you don't want to think too hard but just want to be entertained and happy. I give it a slight recommendation, but I'd suggest the original with more priority. *** out of ****

    Desultory remake of the Billy Wilder classic. Julia Ormond gets the Audrey Hepburn role, and while those are pretty big shoes to fill, she could have at least tried to give a more compelling performance than the listless one she actually gives. "Sabrina" doesn't really work if you spend the whole movie wondering why any man would want to bother with such a wet noodle. Of course, the same could be said for the Harrison Ford character as well -- who'd want to waste her time on such a fuddy-duddy when the uber-charming Greg Kinnear is waiting in the background? Though Kinnear's charm oozes out so thickly you can practically see it, he manages to stay just this side of smarmy, making you wish the movie was about him. There's no compelling reason to see this as long as the original is out there available to rent. Grade: C

    Will go back to reread some of the quality IMDb user comments here. A couple of high level commentators can be viewed---above... Is Mom (1954) or Daughter (1995) "SABRINA" better? While I like Daughter SABRINA a tad better---I love both. There are NO LOSERS in this gentle debate... Both SABRINA versions not only have quality leads---they have great supporting casts. Here, maybe I like 1995 SABRINA a bit more---since the supporting characters are more familiar to me... As I write this, Nancy Marchand (as the Larrabee Matriarch) has made yet another one of her dry quips... Angie Dickinson well portrays the emptyheaded once-trophy wife of David's fianc&eacute;e's equally wealthy family - with Richard Crenna as her husband - And Lauren Holly is the result of the Tyson merger of beauty to brains/wealth - the smart yet beautiful Elisabeth Tyson, MD. - the first sensible female that woman chasing younger brother David has ever fallen for!!! The dialogue in 1995 is silky, gently ironic...and hey...all you would be scriptwriters, movie producers, etc. Study BOTH SABRINAS for how to make quality romantic films. +++++ (NOTE Amazingly, only one (clothed) short pre bedroom scene is in the 1995 version. 99% of this movie succeeds with just great script, production, casting, acting!!! What a novel concept!) Don't waste too much time debating what essentially is personal preference over which wonderful visual desert (Sabrina 1954 or Sabrina 1995) is better....Just see both!!!

    I thoroughly enjoyed this film, having watched it at least 20 times. I regret that my DVD had no behind-the-scenes commentary from the actors or director that many films on DVD offer. It would be great to hear from Harrison Ford or Julia Ormond giving their insights on the film. Julia Ormond dominated this film in every scene she was in. Having watched it so many times, it becomes clear that Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were deliberately creating scenes that she could dominate. In essence, the two male leads were effectively supporting actors. This tactic was great for the film, but acting egos being what they are, not a common occurrence in Hollywood. Julia has not received such support in her other films that I have seen. Something bothered me about the plot of Sabrina that I could not put my finger on. Then it hit me. What did Sabrina do all day? She helped her chauffeur father polish the Rolls-Royce and nothing more. She did not attend college or work as a servant on the Larrabee estate. Perhaps she worked as a domestic for her father in his quarters. How could a woman with such great potential have no discernible ambition? It was interesting to watch how much effort the people working at Vogue magazine devoted to transforming the awkward Sabrina that arrived at their doorstep into a polished and sophisticated woman. These people really invested themselves in helping Sabrina become the beautiful and self-confident woman of the second half of the movie. No wonder David Larrabee didn't recognize Sabrina when she returned from Paris. Harrison Ford is delicious as the scheming Linus Larrabee who sets out to hustle the naive chauffeur's daughter Sabrina. He has been so effective in outmaneuvering his business rivals, Sabrina is dead meat in his opinion. We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived. Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved. Linus meanwhile has his own quandary.

Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

    Some people get very worked up over remakes of their favorite movies. I won't tell you that I particularly enjoy the experience; I don't. But as I watched this version of Sabrina, after having watched the previous one with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, it occurred to me - my mind was wandering - that remakes of movies, like the originals, are like different performances of a given play. No one, I hope, would argue, after having seen a great production of Hamlet or Macbeth, that those plays should not be done again by others. Of course, one could ask why do them if the new company doesn't have something to justify yet another production of them. But there's no reason to argue against further productions in principle. That's how I feel about this version of Sabrina. There are things that I particularly enjoyed in the previous version that I didn't like here. I was very aggravated that this Sabrina did not learn the lessons of self-confidence in Paris that her predecessor did: those lines are cut out of this script, and when she goes to the Larabee party after her return from Paris, this Sabrina is a bundle of nerves - she has not learned self-confidence. This movie is also more often funny than the previous version. That would be a plus for those who want to laugh more during a movie. So, in the end, for me this was not as enjoyable a performance of the story of Sabrina as the previous one. But that's because the aspects of the story that interest me aren't focused on in this version as they were in the previous one. For someone else who is looking for and enjoys different things, this version might have more to offer. And such a person might give it a higher rating.

    Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Gregg Kinnear star in a remake of a 50's movie, originally starring Humphrey Bogart, called Sabrina. I hate to say it but I never saw that movie. But I did see this movie. This is a great movie. It's funny, and definitely romantic. The actors do a fantastic job. Especially Harrison Ford, playing the more likable brother. Harrison ford and Greg Kinnear play two brothers named Linus and David, sons of a tycoon in New York. David is engaged to one of their business partner's daughter(played by Lauren Holly). But he changes his mind when Sabrina(played by Julia Ormond), the daughter of their car driver and an old friend, returns from Paris. When she returns, the two of them plan on meeting up in the solarium. But that leads to an accident involving David. David's brother Linus has always had a crush on her too. So he offers to talk to her after the accident. While David lays injured in bed, Linus starts to hang out with her, and she soon starts to fall for him. Sabrina is a fantastic film. Sydney Pollack did such a great job making this movie. It's a shame he's not alive anymore.Cause he did great films. This was an odd one, and what was he doing in Made of honor? Lord knows. All of the actors do a great job. These are great actors. This is a great film. Sabrina: A

    "Sabrina" is a pretty easily likable romantic comedy, a genre of which I am a fan, even though it is hard to find good ones. This is a decent film, but now that I am comparing it to the 1954 original, it is easier for me to be critical. This movie has a good plot, some humor, and decent romance. Also, I am pleased to find movies like this with so little objectionable content, making it appropriate for the whole family, though the younger ones may not be completely interested. I hate to complain about this movie, but there are a few downsides. It runs too long overall, and it slows down too much toward the end. If you ask me, Harrison Ford doesn't really fit his role and seems to old and lifeless for the part he is intending to play. Also, I'm afraid Greg Kinnear simply cannot fill the brilliance of William Holden's shoes in the original. Julia Ormond takes Audrey Hepburn's role fairly well, but none of these three can possibly compare to the excellence of the original cast. The old film really was not outdated and didn't need to be updated, as films like "The Shop Around the Corner" or "The Parent Trap" did. Despite those things, I'm not going to criticize this film any more. It's good for a date film or when you don't want to think too hard but just want to be entertained and happy. I give it a slight recommendation, but I'd suggest the original with more priority. *** out of ****

    Desultory remake of the Billy Wilder classic. Julia Ormond gets the Audrey Hepburn role, and while those are pretty big shoes to fill, she could have at least tried to give a more compelling performance than the listless one she actually gives. "Sabrina" doesn't really work if you spend the whole movie wondering why any man would want to bother with such a wet noodle. Of course, the same could be said for the Harrison Ford character as well -- who'd want to waste her time on such a fuddy-duddy when the uber-charming Greg Kinnear is waiting in the background? Though Kinnear's charm oozes out so thickly you can practically see it, he manages to stay just this side of smarmy, making you wish the movie was about him. There's no compelling reason to see this as long as the original is out there available to rent. Grade: C

    Will go back to reread some of the quality IMDb user comments here. A couple of high level commentators can be viewed---above... Is Mom (1954) or Daughter (1995) "SABRINA" better? While I like Daughter SABRINA a tad better---I love both. There are NO LOSERS in this gentle debate... Both SABRINA versions not only have quality leads---they have great supporting casts. Here, maybe I like 1995 SABRINA a bit more---since the supporting characters are more familiar to me... As I write this, Nancy Marchand (as the Larrabee Matriarch) has made yet another one of her dry quips... Angie Dickinson well portrays the emptyheaded once-trophy wife of David's fianc&eacute;e's equally wealthy family - with Richard Crenna as her husband - And Lauren Holly is the result of the Tyson merger of beauty to brains/wealth - the smart yet beautiful Elisabeth Tyson, MD. - the first sensible female that woman chasing younger brother David has ever fallen for!!! The dialogue in 1995 is silky, gently ironic...and hey...all you would be scriptwriters, movie producers, etc. Study BOTH SABRINAS for how to make quality romantic films. +++++ (NOTE Amazingly, only one (clothed) short pre bedroom scene is in the 1995 version. 99% of this movie succeeds with just great script, production, casting, acting!!! What a novel concept!) Don't waste too much time debating what essentially is personal preference over which wonderful visual desert (Sabrina 1954 or Sabrina 1995) is better....Just see both!!!

    I thoroughly enjoyed this film, having watched it at least 20 times. I regret that my DVD had no behind-the-scenes commentary from the actors or director that many films on DVD offer. It would be great to hear from Harrison Ford or Julia Ormond giving their insights on the film. Julia Ormond dominated this film in every scene she was in. Having watched it so many times, it becomes clear that Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were deliberately creating scenes that she could dominate. In essence, the two male leads were effectively supporting actors. This tactic was great for the film, but acting egos being what they are, not a common occurrence in Hollywood. Julia has not received such support in her other films that I have seen. Something bothered me about the plot of Sabrina that I could not put my finger on. Then it hit me. What did Sabrina do all day? She helped her chauffeur father polish the Rolls-Royce and nothing more. She did not attend college or work as a servant on the Larrabee estate. Perhaps she worked as a domestic for her father in his quarters. How could a woman with such great potential have no discernible ambition? It was interesting to watch how much effort the people working at Vogue magazine devoted to transforming the awkward Sabrina that arrived at their doorstep into a polished and sophisticated woman. These people really invested themselves in helping Sabrina become the beautiful and self-confident woman of the second half of the movie. No wonder David Larrabee didn't recognize Sabrina when she returned from Paris. Harrison Ford is delicious as the scheming Linus Larrabee who sets out to hustle the naive chauffeur's daughter Sabrina. He has been so effective in outmaneuvering his business rivals, Sabrina is dead meat in his opinion. We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived. Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved. Linus meanwhile has his own quandary. He has developed deep feelings for Sabrina and cannot bring himself to betray her for the sake of a large sum of money. He reveals the deception to her and a shattered Sabrina flees back to her beloved Paris where she had some happiness even with the loneliness she has suffered her whole life. Here is where the plot seems to slip. All Linus had to do was to keep his initial deception to himself and actually sweep Sabrina away to Paris. He could make a brief return to the USA to close the business deal and return to his love in Paris with her none the wiser. Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness. Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

    It's dangerous to remake anything with Audrey Hepburn because no one can compare to her. This movie is a case in point. Julia Ormond is a good actress but she isn't suited to this role because she has a harder look about her and just doesn't have Audrey's sophisticated delicate sweetness. Few do. These were impossible shoes to fill. Greg Kinnear doesn't have William Holden's devilish charm. That's why he is an excellent supporting actor but not a romantic lead. Harrison Ford is ill at ease in romantic roles. He's reached the Clint Eastwood Robert Redford stage - time to go behind the screen. Don't watch this one just stick to the original.

    There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a good film. With fine actors and performances. But, no matter how wonderful he is, Harrison Ford is not Humphrey Bogart. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn. And Greg Kinnear is not William Holden. And I think the difference is most easily seen between Bogart and Ford. Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Bogart often wasn't (but every once in a while he was magnificent). But there was something very special and unique about Bogart in the original. Perhaps that it was so against type...making the transformation at the end so much more stunning. But just because you put a pair of professor-style glasses on Harrison Ford, doesn't mean you make him not-sexy (at least nearly 20 years ago when this film was made). People often ask is the story the same in the old and new versions. Superficially, yes. But in reality, there is a key difference. In the Bogart/Hepburn version, Bogart rather suddenly realizes he is in love with Sabrina. In this version, the love grows gradually and is fully realized by Harrison Ford...and confuses him. Another difference, in my view, is what each film "is". This version is a romance movie. The older version was a fairy tale. Harrison Ford is excellent here, and it occurred to me several times while watching the film that it's too bad we didn't see him more often in romantic roles during this career. Julia Ormond was excellent, as well, and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen much of her in recent years...but in looking it up I see that she has remained busy, but mostly not in leading roles. Greg Kinnear was one of those actors who kinda snuck up on me; this was his first significant role, and it made me realize that he was much more talented than I would have thought based on my former experiences seeing him on "Talk Soup". Angie Dickinson has a "nothing" role as the mother of "the other woman", and Richard Crenna's role as the father of the "other woman" was probably the least impressive work he has ever done on celluloid; he was really a very talented supporting actor. It was always a treat seeing Nancy Marchand in a film, and no exception to that here. John Wood as Sabrina's father...very good. A real gem of a performance, which may be often overlooked, is that of Dana Ivey, the secretary! I recommend both the original and this remake, although I doubt the remake will end up being the classic that the original was.

    I've seen the 1954 version and this one and liked them both; although, I liked this one better. Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond do a good job playing the uptight business obsessed Linus, and Sabrina, the chauffeur's daughter. This is escapist romance at its best. Sabrina is totally infatuated with David, the younger son on the Long Island Larabie estate. She has watched and adored him for years from a perch in the tree near the chauffeur's quarters. Her father sends her to Paris hoping the experience will broaden her horizons and cure her of this obsession. When she comes back, she encounter's David in all her new Paris sophistication. What will be the result? The film is beautifully directed by Sydney Pollack. The dialogue is witty, the acting very well done. Please rent "Sabrina." You won't be disappointed.

    I couldn't even watch to the end and had to stop in the middle - which I usually never do for a movie or a book. Everything seemed dull. - Julia Ormond: is sad and ugly, even when she is supposedly that new fashionable woman back from Paris. She doesn't have the playfulness and liveliness or even half of the class and sense of style and fashion of the original (and she is supposed to have worked at Vogue). Her evening dress at the Larabee's party? blah... Her haircut makes her look too mature and in her late 30's (The girl playing E. Tyson was much more attractive and young) and I wasn't impressed with her character transformation. The way that transformation occurs isn't even that detailed or deep, as the assistant photographer. In the original, it is not deep or detailed either, but at least it is done in a fun, lighthearted way at the cooking school. - the dialogs:they were painful, dull and the self-awareness with which the lines were delivered made my skin crawl. The scene where Sabrina talks about her feelings to a hidden Linus before going to Paris was delivered with lackluster and a sadness that were painful to watch. I felt ashamed for Ormond. I missed the way Audrey Hepburn inhales with delight the deadly fumes of the cars, or even the simple goodbye letter she writes to her father. - I felt sad for Harrison Ford, because I usually like him very much and think he was not exactly miscast, but lost with all these sad characters to deal with in the first place. - I didn't feel any chemistry with the characters. That young man in Paris who falls in love with Sabrina doesn't even make sense. Why fall for such a clumsy ugly girl who can't say a word straight? What is their link, except for their jobs? What do they share in common? What is to be seen in her that makes her endearing? - In the old times, they knew how to suggest an atmosphere and a character in one shot. Today, we over explain. An example. In the old version, when we are first introduced to the Larabees, we see a painting of the family on the wall, then the family pausing for professional photographers. We know right there the pride, the arrogance of a rich family, the annoyed expression of Bogart, the delighted smile of his brother, the haughtiness of the mother etc.In the new version, we have a painfully long explanation of who is who, showing every character in turn. Another example? The ending, where Linus gets on the boat, asks for his hat to be arranged and sticks his umbrella on someone's coat belt, and we are meant to understand that he is at least on the same page as Sabrina. We don't need the again painful explanatory dialog of 10 minutes between the two leads. I could go on and on, scene by scene, from the chauffeur, to that round window showing the Eiffel tower and the french cook, to the beautiful ball dress Audrey is wearing and the witty short dialogs, the old version was a winner. The new version lacks subtlety and charm.

Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived. Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved. Linus meanwhile has his own quandary. He has developed deep feelings for Sabrina and cannot bring himself to betray her for the sake of a large sum of money. He reveals the deception to her and a shattered Sabrina flees back to her beloved Paris where she had some happiness even with the loneliness she has suffered her whole life. Here is where the plot seems to slip. All Linus had to do was to keep his initial deception to himself and actually sweep Sabrina away to Paris. He could make a brief return to the USA to close the business deal and return to his love in Paris with her none the wiser. Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness. Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

    It's dangerous to remake anything with Audrey Hepburn because no one can compare to her. This movie is a case in point. Julia Ormond is a good actress but she isn't suited to this role because she has a harder look about her and just doesn't have Audrey's sophisticated delicate sweetness. Few do. These were impossible shoes to fill. Greg Kinnear doesn't have William Holden's devilish charm. That's why he is an excellent supporting actor but not a romantic lead. Harrison Ford is ill at ease in romantic roles. He's reached the Clint Eastwood Robert Redford stage - time to go behind the screen. Don't watch this one just stick to the original.

    There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a good film. With fine actors and performances. But, no matter how wonderful he is, Harrison Ford is not Humphrey Bogart. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn. And Greg Kinnear is not William Holden. And I think the difference is most easily seen between Bogart and Ford. Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Bogart often wasn't (but every once in a while he was magnificent). But there was something very special and unique about Bogart in the original. Perhaps that it was so against type...making the transformation at the end so much more stunning. But just because you put a pair of professor-style glasses on Harrison Ford, doesn't mean you make him not-sexy (at least nearly 20 years ago when this film was made). People often ask is the story the same in the old and new versions. Superficially, yes. But in reality, there is a key difference. In the Bogart/Hepburn version, Bogart rather suddenly realizes he is in love with Sabrina. In this version, the love grows gradually and is fully realized by Harrison Ford...and confuses him. Another difference, in my view, is what each film "is". This version is a romance movie. The older version was a fairy tale. Harrison Ford is excellent here, and it occurred to me several times while watching the film that it's too bad we didn't see him more often in romantic roles during this career. Julia Ormond was excellent, as well, and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen much of her in recent years...but in looking it up I see that she has remained busy, but mostly not in leading roles. Greg Kinnear was one of those actors who kinda snuck up on me; this was his first significant role, and it made me realize that he was much more talented than I would have thought based on my former experiences seeing him on "Talk Soup". Angie Dickinson has a "nothing" role as the mother of "the other woman", and Richard Crenna's role as the father of the "other woman" was probably the least impressive work he has ever done on celluloid; he was really a very talented supporting actor. It was always a treat seeing Nancy Marchand in a film, and no exception to that here. John Wood as Sabrina's father...very good. A real gem of a performance, which may be often overlooked, is that of Dana Ivey, the secretary! I recommend both the original and this remake, although I doubt the remake will end up being the classic that the original was.

    I've seen the 1954 version and this one and liked them both; although, I liked this one better. Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond do a good job playing the uptight business obsessed Linus, and Sabrina, the chauffeur's daughter. This is escapist romance at its best. Sabrina is totally infatuated with David, the younger son on the Long Island Larabie estate. She has watched and adored him for years from a perch in the tree near the chauffeur's quarters. Her father sends her to Paris hoping the experience will broaden her horizons and cure her of this obsession. When she comes back, she encounter's David in all her new Paris sophistication. What will be the result? The film is beautifully directed by Sydney Pollack. The dialogue is witty, the acting very well done. Please rent "Sabrina." You won't be disappointed.

    I couldn't even watch to the end and had to stop in the middle - which I usually never do for a movie or a book. Everything seemed dull. - Julia Ormond: is sad and ugly, even when she is supposedly that new fashionable woman back from Paris. She doesn't have the playfulness and liveliness or even half of the class and sense of style and fashion of the original (and she is supposed to have worked at Vogue). Her evening dress at the Larabee's party? blah... Her haircut makes her look too mature and in her late 30's (The girl playing E. Tyson was much more attractive and young) and I wasn't impressed with her character transformation. The way that transformation occurs isn't even that detailed or deep, as the assistant photographer. In the original, it is not deep or detailed either, but at least it is done in a fun, lighthearted way at the cooking school. - the dialogs:they were painful, dull and the self-awareness with which the lines were delivered made my skin crawl. The scene where Sabrina talks about her feelings to a hidden Linus before going to Paris was delivered with lackluster and a sadness that were painful to watch. I felt ashamed for Ormond. I missed the way Audrey Hepburn inhales with delight the deadly fumes of the cars, or even the simple goodbye letter she writes to her father. - I felt sad for Harrison Ford, because I usually like him very much and think he was not exactly miscast, but lost with all these sad characters to deal with in the first place. - I didn't feel any chemistry with the characters. That young man in Paris who falls in love with Sabrina doesn't even make sense. Why fall for such a clumsy ugly girl who can't say a word straight? What is their link, except for their jobs? What do they share in common? What is to be seen in her that makes her endearing? - In the old times, they knew how to suggest an atmosphere and a character in one shot. Today, we over explain. An example. In the old version, when we are first introduced to the Larabees, we see a painting of the family on the wall, then the family pausing for professional photographers. We know right there the pride, the arrogance of a rich family, the annoyed expression of Bogart, the delighted smile of his brother, the haughtiness of the mother etc.In the new version, we have a painfully long explanation of who is who, showing every character in turn. Another example? The ending, where Linus gets on the boat, asks for his hat to be arranged and sticks his umbrella on someone's coat belt, and we are meant to understand that he is at least on the same page as Sabrina. We don't need the again painful explanatory dialog of 10 minutes between the two leads. I could go on and on, scene by scene, from the chauffeur, to that round window showing the Eiffel tower and the french cook, to the beautiful ball dress Audrey is wearing and the witty short dialogs, the old version was a winner. The new version lacks subtlety and charm.

    Some people get very worked up over remakes of their favorite movies. I won't tell you that I particularly enjoy the experience; I don't. But as I watched this version of Sabrina, after having watched the previous one with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, it occurred to me - my mind was wandering - that remakes of movies, like the originals, are like different performances of a given play. No one, I hope, would argue, after having seen a great production of Hamlet or Macbeth, that those plays should not be done again by others. Of course, one could ask why do them if the new company doesn't have something to justify yet another production of them. But there's no reason to argue against further productions in principle. That's how I feel about this version of Sabrina. There are things that I particularly enjoyed in the previous version that I didn't like here. I was very aggravated that this Sabrina did not learn the lessons of self-confidence in Paris that her predecessor did: those lines are cut out of this script, and when she goes to the Larabee party after her return from Paris, this Sabrina is a bundle of nerves - she has not learned self-confidence. This movie is also more often funny than the previous version. That would be a plus for those who want to laugh more during a movie. So, in the end, for me this was not as enjoyable a performance of the story of Sabrina as the previous one. But that's because the aspects of the story that interest me aren't focused on in this version as they were in the previous one. For someone else who is looking for and enjoys different things, this version might have more to offer. And such a person might give it a higher rating.

    Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Gregg Kinnear star in a remake of a 50's movie, originally starring Humphrey Bogart, called Sabrina. I hate to say it but I never saw that movie. But I did see this movie. This is a great movie. It's funny, and definitely romantic. The actors do a fantastic job. Especially Harrison Ford, playing the more likable brother. Harrison ford and Greg Kinnear play two brothers named Linus and David, sons of a tycoon in New York. David is engaged to one of their business partner's daughter(played by Lauren Holly). But he changes his mind when Sabrina(played by Julia Ormond), the daughter of their car driver and an old friend, returns from Paris. When she returns, the two of them plan on meeting up in the solarium. But that leads to an accident involving David. David's brother Linus has always had a crush on her too. So he offers to talk to her after the accident. While David lays injured in bed, Linus starts to hang out with her, and she soon starts to fall for him. Sabrina is a fantastic film. Sydney Pollack did such a great job making this movie. It's a shame he's not alive anymore.Cause he did great films. This was an odd one, and what was he doing in Made of honor? Lord knows. All of the actors do a great job. These are great actors. This is a great film. Sabrina: A

    "Sabrina" is a pretty easily likable romantic comedy, a genre of which I am a fan, even though it is hard to find good ones. This is a decent film, but now that I am comparing it to the 1954 original, it is easier for me to be critical. This movie has a good plot, some humor, and decent romance. Also, I am pleased to find movies like this with so little objectionable content, making it appropriate for the whole family, though the younger ones may not be completely interested. I hate to complain about this movie, but there are a few downsides. It runs too long overall, and it slows down too much toward the end. If you ask me, Harrison Ford doesn't really fit his role and seems to old and lifeless for the part he is intending to play. Also, I'm afraid Greg Kinnear simply cannot fill the brilliance of William Holden's shoes in the original. Julia Ormond takes Audrey Hepburn's role fairly well, but none of these three can possibly compare to the excellence of the original cast. The old film really was not outdated and didn't need to be updated, as films like "The Shop Around the Corner" or "The Parent Trap" did. Despite those things, I'm not going to criticize this film any more. It's good for a date film or when you don't want to think too hard but just want to be entertained and happy. I give it a slight recommendation, but I'd suggest the original with more priority. *** out of ****

    Desultory remake of the Billy Wilder classic. Julia Ormond gets the Audrey Hepburn role, and while those are pretty big shoes to fill, she could have at least tried to give a more compelling performance than the listless one she actually gives. "Sabrina" doesn't really work if you spend the whole movie wondering why any man would want to bother with such a wet noodle. Of course, the same could be said for the Harrison Ford character as well -- who'd want to waste her time on such a fuddy-duddy when the uber-charming Greg Kinnear is waiting in the background? Though Kinnear's charm oozes out so thickly you can practically see it, he manages to stay just this side of smarmy, making you wish the movie was about him. There's no compelling reason to see this as long as the original is out there available to rent. Grade: C

    Will go back to reread some of the quality IMDb user comments here. A couple of high level commentators can be viewed---above... Is Mom (1954) or Daughter (1995) "SABRINA" better? While I like Daughter SABRINA a tad better---I love both. There are NO LOSERS in this gentle debate... Both SABRINA versions not only have quality leads---they have great supporting casts. Here, maybe I like 1995 SABRINA a bit more---since the supporting characters are more familiar to me... As I write this, Nancy Marchand (as the Larrabee Matriarch) has made yet another one of her dry quips... Angie Dickinson well portrays the emptyheaded once-trophy wife of David's fianc&eacute;e's equally wealthy family - with Richard Crenna as her husband - And Lauren Holly is the result of the Tyson merger of beauty to brains/wealth - the smart yet beautiful Elisabeth Tyson, MD. - the first sensible female that woman chasing younger brother David has ever fallen for!!! The dialogue in 1995 is silky, gently ironic...and hey...all you would be scriptwriters, movie producers, etc. Study BOTH SABRINAS for how to make quality romantic films. +++++ (NOTE Amazingly, only one (clothed) short pre bedroom scene is in the 1995 version. 99% of this movie succeeds with just great script, production, casting, acting!!! What a novel concept!) Don't waste too much time debating what essentially is personal preference over which wonderful visual desert (Sabrina 1954 or Sabrina 1995) is better....Just see both!!!

    I thoroughly enjoyed this film, having watched it at least 20 times. I regret that my DVD had no behind-the-scenes commentary from the actors or director that many films on DVD offer. It would be great to hear from Harrison Ford or Julia Ormond giving their insights on the film. Julia Ormond dominated this film in every scene she was in. Having watched it so many times, it becomes clear that Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were deliberately creating scenes that she could dominate. In essence, the two male leads were effectively supporting actors. This tactic was great for the film, but acting egos being what they are, not a common occurrence in Hollywood. Julia has not received such support in her other films that I have seen. Something bothered me about the plot of Sabrina that I could not put my finger on. Then it hit me. What did Sabrina do all day? She helped her chauffeur father polish the Rolls-Royce and nothing more. She did not attend college or work as a servant on the Larrabee estate. Perhaps she worked as a domestic for her father in his quarters. How could a woman with such great potential have no discernible ambition? It was interesting to watch how much effort the people working at Vogue magazine devoted to transforming the awkward Sabrina that arrived at their doorstep into a polished and sophisticated woman. These people really invested themselves in helping Sabrina become the beautiful and self-confident woman of the second half of the movie. No wonder David Larrabee didn't recognize Sabrina when she returned from Paris. Harrison Ford is delicious as the scheming Linus Larrabee who sets out to hustle the naive chauffeur's daughter Sabrina. He has been so effective in outmaneuvering his business rivals, Sabrina is dead meat in his opinion. We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived. Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies.

Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

    Some people get very worked up over remakes of their favorite movies. I won't tell you that I particularly enjoy the experience; I don't. But as I watched this version of Sabrina, after having watched the previous one with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, it occurred to me - my mind was wandering - that remakes of movies, like the originals, are like different performances of a given play. No one, I hope, would argue, after having seen a great production of Hamlet or Macbeth, that those plays should not be done again by others. Of course, one could ask why do them if the new company doesn't have something to justify yet another production of them. But there's no reason to argue against further productions in principle. That's how I feel about this version of Sabrina. There are things that I particularly enjoyed in the previous version that I didn't like here. I was very aggravated that this Sabrina did not learn the lessons of self-confidence in Paris that her predecessor did: those lines are cut out of this script, and when she goes to the Larabee party after her return from Paris, this Sabrina is a bundle of nerves - she has not learned self-confidence. This movie is also more often funny than the previous version. That would be a plus for those who want to laugh more during a movie. So, in the end, for me this was not as enjoyable a performance of the story of Sabrina as the previous one. But that's because the aspects of the story that interest me aren't focused on in this version as they were in the previous one. For someone else who is looking for and enjoys different things, this version might have more to offer. And such a person might give it a higher rating.

    Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Gregg Kinnear star in a remake of a 50's movie, originally starring Humphrey Bogart, called Sabrina. I hate to say it but I never saw that movie. But I did see this movie. This is a great movie. It's funny, and definitely romantic. The actors do a fantastic job. Especially Harrison Ford, playing the more likable brother. Harrison ford and Greg Kinnear play two brothers named Linus and David, sons of a tycoon in New York. David is engaged to one of their business partner's daughter(played by Lauren Holly). But he changes his mind when Sabrina(played by Julia Ormond), the daughter of their car driver and an old friend, returns from Paris. When she returns, the two of them plan on meeting up in the solarium. But that leads to an accident involving David. David's brother Linus has always had a crush on her too. So he offers to talk to her after the accident. While David lays injured in bed, Linus starts to hang out with her, and she soon starts to fall for him. Sabrina is a fantastic film. Sydney Pollack did such a great job making this movie. It's a shame he's not alive anymore.Cause he did great films. This was an odd one, and what was he doing in Made of honor? Lord knows. All of the actors do a great job. These are great actors. This is a great film. Sabrina: A

    "Sabrina" is a pretty easily likable romantic comedy, a genre of which I am a fan, even though it is hard to find good ones. This is a decent film, but now that I am comparing it to the 1954 original, it is easier for me to be critical. This movie has a good plot, some humor, and decent romance. Also, I am pleased to find movies like this with so little objectionable content, making it appropriate for the whole family, though the younger ones may not be completely interested. I hate to complain about this movie, but there are a few downsides. It runs too long overall, and it slows down too much toward the end. If you ask me, Harrison Ford doesn't really fit his role and seems to old and lifeless for the part he is intending to play. Also, I'm afraid Greg Kinnear simply cannot fill the brilliance of William Holden's shoes in the original. Julia Ormond takes Audrey Hepburn's role fairly well, but none of these three can possibly compare to the excellence of the original cast. The old film really was not outdated and didn't need to be updated, as films like "The Shop Around the Corner" or "The Parent Trap" did. Despite those things, I'm not going to criticize this film any more. It's good for a date film or when you don't want to think too hard but just want to be entertained and happy. I give it a slight recommendation, but I'd suggest the original with more priority. *** out of ****

    Desultory remake of the Billy Wilder classic. Julia Ormond gets the Audrey Hepburn role, and while those are pretty big shoes to fill, she could have at least tried to give a more compelling performance than the listless one she actually gives. "Sabrina" doesn't really work if you spend the whole movie wondering why any man would want to bother with such a wet noodle. Of course, the same could be said for the Harrison Ford character as well -- who'd want to waste her time on such a fuddy-duddy when the uber-charming Greg Kinnear is waiting in the background? Though Kinnear's charm oozes out so thickly you can practically see it, he manages to stay just this side of smarmy, making you wish the movie was about him. There's no compelling reason to see this as long as the original is out there available to rent. Grade: C

    Will go back to reread some of the quality IMDb user comments here. A couple of high level commentators can be viewed---above... Is Mom (1954) or Daughter (1995) "SABRINA" better? While I like Daughter SABRINA a tad better---I love both. There are NO LOSERS in this gentle debate... Both SABRINA versions not only have quality leads---they have great supporting casts. Here, maybe I like 1995 SABRINA a bit more---since the supporting characters are more familiar to me... As I write this, Nancy Marchand (as the Larrabee Matriarch) has made yet another one of her dry quips... Angie Dickinson well portrays the emptyheaded once-trophy wife of David's fianc&eacute;e's equally wealthy family - with Richard Crenna as her husband - And Lauren Holly is the result of the Tyson merger of beauty to brains/wealth - the smart yet beautiful Elisabeth Tyson, MD. - the first sensible female that woman chasing younger brother David has ever fallen for!!! The dialogue in 1995 is silky, gently ironic...and hey...all you would be scriptwriters, movie producers, etc. Study BOTH SABRINAS for how to make quality romantic films. +++++ (NOTE Amazingly, only one (clothed) short pre bedroom scene is in the 1995 version. 99% of this movie succeeds with just great script, production, casting, acting!!! What a novel concept!) Don't waste too much time debating what essentially is personal preference over which wonderful visual desert (Sabrina 1954 or Sabrina 1995) is better....Just see both!!!

    I thoroughly enjoyed this film, having watched it at least 20 times. I regret that my DVD had no behind-the-scenes commentary from the actors or director that many films on DVD offer. It would be great to hear from Harrison Ford or Julia Ormond giving their insights on the film. Julia Ormond dominated this film in every scene she was in. Having watched it so many times, it becomes clear that Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were deliberately creating scenes that she could dominate. In essence, the two male leads were effectively supporting actors. This tactic was great for the film, but acting egos being what they are, not a common occurrence in Hollywood. Julia has not received such support in her other films that I have seen. Something bothered me about the plot of Sabrina that I could not put my finger on. Then it hit me. What did Sabrina do all day? She helped her chauffeur father polish the Rolls-Royce and nothing more. She did not attend college or work as a servant on the Larrabee estate. Perhaps she worked as a domestic for her father in his quarters. How could a woman with such great potential have no discernible ambition? It was interesting to watch how much effort the people working at Vogue magazine devoted to transforming the awkward Sabrina that arrived at their doorstep into a polished and sophisticated woman. These people really invested themselves in helping Sabrina become the beautiful and self-confident woman of the second half of the movie. No wonder David Larrabee didn't recognize Sabrina when she returned from Paris. Harrison Ford is delicious as the scheming Linus Larrabee who sets out to hustle the naive chauffeur's daughter Sabrina. He has been so effective in outmaneuvering his business rivals, Sabrina is dead meat in his opinion. We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived. Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved. Linus meanwhile has his own quandary. He has developed deep feelings for Sabrina and cannot bring himself to betray her for the sake of a large sum of money. He reveals the deception to her and a shattered Sabrina flees back to her beloved Paris where she had some happiness even with the loneliness she has suffered her whole life. Here is where the plot seems to slip. All Linus had to do was to keep his initial deception to himself and actually sweep Sabrina away to Paris. He could make a brief return to the USA to close the business deal and return to his love in Paris with her none the wiser. Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness. Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

    It's dangerous to remake anything with Audrey Hepburn because no one can compare to her. This movie is a case in point. Julia Ormond is a good actress but she isn't suited to this role because she has a harder look about her and just doesn't have Audrey's sophisticated delicate sweetness. Few do. These were impossible shoes to fill. Greg Kinnear doesn't have William Holden's devilish charm. That's why he is an excellent supporting actor but not a romantic lead. Harrison Ford is ill at ease in romantic roles. He's reached the Clint Eastwood Robert Redford stage - time to go behind the screen. Don't watch this one just stick to the original.

    There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a good film. With fine actors and performances. But, no matter how wonderful he is, Harrison Ford is not Humphrey Bogart. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn. And Greg Kinnear is not William Holden. And I think the difference is most easily seen between Bogart and Ford. Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Bogart often wasn't (but every once in a while he was magnificent). But there was something very special and unique about Bogart in the original. Perhaps that it was so against type...making the transformation at the end so much more stunning. But just because you put a pair of professor-style glasses on Harrison Ford, doesn't mean you make him not-sexy (at least nearly 20 years ago when this film was made). People often ask is the story the same in the old and new versions. Superficially, yes. But in reality, there is a key difference. In the Bogart/Hepburn version, Bogart rather suddenly realizes he is in love with Sabrina. In this version, the love grows gradually and is fully realized by Harrison Ford...and confuses him. Another difference, in my view, is what each film "is". This version is a romance movie. The older version was a fairy tale. Harrison Ford is excellent here, and it occurred to me several times while watching the film that it's too bad we didn't see him more often in romantic roles during this career. Julia Ormond was excellent, as well, and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen much of her in recent years...but in looking it up I see that she has remained busy, but mostly not in leading roles. Greg Kinnear was one of those actors who kinda snuck up on me; this was his first significant role, and it made me realize that he was much more talented than I would have thought based on my former experiences seeing him on "Talk Soup". Angie Dickinson has a "nothing" role as the mother of "the other woman", and Richard Crenna's role as the father of the "other woman" was probably the least impressive work he has ever done on celluloid; he was really a very talented supporting actor. It was always a treat seeing Nancy Marchand in a film, and no exception to that here. John Wood as Sabrina's father...very good. A real gem of a performance, which may be often overlooked, is that of Dana Ivey, the secretary! I recommend both the original and this remake, although I doubt the remake will end up being the classic that the original was.

    I've seen the 1954 version and this one and liked them both; although, I liked this one better. Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond do a good job playing the uptight business obsessed Linus, and Sabrina, the chauffeur's daughter. This is escapist romance at its best. Sabrina is totally infatuated with David, the younger son on the Long Island Larabie estate. She has watched and adored him for years from a perch in the tree near the chauffeur's quarters. Her father sends her to Paris hoping the experience will broaden her horizons and cure her of this obsession. When she comes back, she encounter's David in all her new Paris sophistication. What will be the result? The film is beautifully directed by Sydney Pollack. The dialogue is witty, the acting very well done. Please rent "Sabrina." You won't be disappointed.

    I couldn't even watch to the end and had to stop in the middle - which I usually never do for a movie or a book. Everything seemed dull. - Julia Ormond: is sad and ugly, even when she is supposedly that new fashionable woman back from Paris. She doesn't have the playfulness and liveliness or even half of the class and sense of style and fashion of the original (and she is supposed to have worked at Vogue). Her evening dress at the Larabee's party? blah... Her haircut makes her look too mature and in her late 30's (The girl playing E. Tyson was much more attractive and young) and I wasn't impressed with her character transformation. The way that transformation occurs isn't even that detailed or deep, as the assistant photographer. In the original, it is not deep or detailed either, but at least it is done in a fun, lighthearted way at the cooking school. - the dialogs:they were painful, dull and the self-awareness with which the lines were delivered made my skin crawl. The scene where Sabrina talks about her feelings to a hidden Linus before going to Paris was delivered with lackluster and a sadness that were painful to watch. I felt ashamed for Ormond. I missed the way Audrey Hepburn inhales with delight the deadly fumes of the cars, or even the simple goodbye letter she writes to her father. - I felt sad for Harrison Ford, because I usually like him very much and think he was not exactly miscast, but lost with all these sad characters to deal with in the first place. - I didn't feel any chemistry with the characters. That young man in Paris who falls in love with Sabrina doesn't even make sense. Why fall for such a clumsy ugly girl who can't say a word straight? What is their link, except for their jobs? What do they share in common? What is to be seen in her that makes her endearing? - In the old times, they knew how to suggest an atmosphere and a character in one shot. Today, we over explain. An example. In the old version, when we are first introduced to the Larabees, we see a painting of the family on the wall, then the family pausing for professional photographers. We know right there the pride, the arrogance of a rich family, the annoyed expression of Bogart, the delighted smile of his brother, the haughtiness of the mother etc.In the new version, we have a painfully long explanation of who is who, showing every character in turn. Another example? The ending, where Linus gets on the boat, asks for his hat to be arranged and sticks his umbrella on someone's coat belt, and we are meant to understand that he is at least on the same page as Sabrina. We don't need the again painful explanatory dialog of 10 minutes between the two leads. I could go on and on, scene by scene, from the chauffeur, to that round window showing the Eiffel tower and the french cook, to the beautiful ball dress Audrey is wearing and the witty short dialogs, the old version was a winner. The new version lacks subtlety and charm.

We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived. Linus keeps drawing Sabrina into interacting with him on one pretext after another. When he calls her at home, Sabrina is visibly pleased to have him invite her back to his office. At the same time, she feels her growing attraction to Linus is destroying her dream of a life with David. When Linus urges Sabrina to drop everything for a trip with him to Paris, she finally has to decide where her heart lies. Sabrina makes her choice for Linus and is most relieved to have the quandary resolved. Linus meanwhile has his own quandary. He has developed deep feelings for Sabrina and cannot bring himself to betray her for the sake of a large sum of money. He reveals the deception to her and a shattered Sabrina flees back to her beloved Paris where she had some happiness even with the loneliness she has suffered her whole life. Here is where the plot seems to slip. All Linus had to do was to keep his initial deception to himself and actually sweep Sabrina away to Paris. He could make a brief return to the USA to close the business deal and return to his love in Paris with her none the wiser. Instead, Linus comes to realize he must pursue Sabrina to Paris and attempt to patch up her shattered heart if he is to find happiness. Sabrina is startled to meet Linus in Paris waiting outside her door. He claims to really love her and want to stay with her in Paris. If Sabrina were a little more shrewd, she could have demanded Linus marry her to prove his devotion instead of taking him at his word. At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.

    It's dangerous to remake anything with Audrey Hepburn because no one can compare to her. This movie is a case in point. Julia Ormond is a good actress but she isn't suited to this role because she has a harder look about her and just doesn't have Audrey's sophisticated delicate sweetness. Few do. These were impossible shoes to fill. Greg Kinnear doesn't have William Holden's devilish charm. That's why he is an excellent supporting actor but not a romantic lead. Harrison Ford is ill at ease in romantic roles. He's reached the Clint Eastwood Robert Redford stage - time to go behind the screen. Don't watch this one just stick to the original.

    There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a good film. With fine actors and performances. But, no matter how wonderful he is, Harrison Ford is not Humphrey Bogart. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn. And Greg Kinnear is not William Holden. And I think the difference is most easily seen between Bogart and Ford. Ford is one of my favorite actors, and Bogart often wasn't (but every once in a while he was magnificent). But there was something very special and unique about Bogart in the original. Perhaps that it was so against type...making the transformation at the end so much more stunning. But just because you put a pair of professor-style glasses on Harrison Ford, doesn't mean you make him not-sexy (at least nearly 20 years ago when this film was made). People often ask is the story the same in the old and new versions. Superficially, yes. But in reality, there is a key difference. In the Bogart/Hepburn version, Bogart rather suddenly realizes he is in love with Sabrina. In this version, the love grows gradually and is fully realized by Harrison Ford...and confuses him. Another difference, in my view, is what each film "is". This version is a romance movie. The older version was a fairy tale. Harrison Ford is excellent here, and it occurred to me several times while watching the film that it's too bad we didn't see him more often in romantic roles during this career. Julia Ormond was excellent, as well, and it occurred to me that I hadn't seen much of her in recent years...but in looking it up I see that she has remained busy, but mostly not in leading roles. Greg Kinnear was one of those actors who kinda snuck up on me; this was his first significant role, and it made me realize that he was much more talented than I would have thought based on my former experiences seeing him on "Talk Soup". Angie Dickinson has a "nothing" role as the mother of "the other woman", and Richard Crenna's role as the father of the "other woman" was probably the least impressive work he has ever done on celluloid; he was really a very talented supporting actor. It was always a treat seeing Nancy Marchand in a film, and no exception to that here. John Wood as Sabrina's father...very good. A real gem of a performance, which may be often overlooked, is that of Dana Ivey, the secretary! I recommend both the original and this remake, although I doubt the remake will end up being the classic that the original was.

    I've seen the 1954 version and this one and liked them both; although, I liked this one better. Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond do a good job playing the uptight business obsessed Linus, and Sabrina, the chauffeur's daughter. This is escapist romance at its best. Sabrina is totally infatuated with David, the younger son on the Long Island Larabie estate. She has watched and adored him for years from a perch in the tree near the chauffeur's quarters. Her father sends her to Paris hoping the experience will broaden her horizons and cure her of this obsession. When she comes back, she encounter's David in all her new Paris sophistication. What will be the result? The film is beautifully directed by Sydney Pollack. The dialogue is witty, the acting very well done. Please rent "Sabrina." You won't be disappointed.

    I couldn't even watch to the end and had to stop in the middle - which I usually never do for a movie or a book. Everything seemed dull. - Julia Ormond: is sad and ugly, even when she is supposedly that new fashionable woman back from Paris. She doesn't have the playfulness and liveliness or even half of the class and sense of style and fashion of the original (and she is supposed to have worked at Vogue). Her evening dress at the Larabee's party? blah... Her haircut makes her look too mature and in her late 30's (The girl playing E. Tyson was much more attractive and young) and I wasn't impressed with her character transformation. The way that transformation occurs isn't even that detailed or deep, as the assistant photographer. In the original, it is not deep or detailed either, but at least it is done in a fun, lighthearted way at the cooking school. - the dialogs:they were painful, dull and the self-awareness with which the lines were delivered made my skin crawl. The scene where Sabrina talks about her feelings to a hidden Linus before going to Paris was delivered with lackluster and a sadness that were painful to watch. I felt ashamed for Ormond. I missed the way Audrey Hepburn inhales with delight the deadly fumes of the cars, or even the simple goodbye letter she writes to her father. - I felt sad for Harrison Ford, because I usually like him very much and think he was not exactly miscast, but lost with all these sad characters to deal with in the first place. - I didn't feel any chemistry with the characters. That young man in Paris who falls in love with Sabrina doesn't even make sense. Why fall for such a clumsy ugly girl who can't say a word straight? What is their link, except for their jobs? What do they share in common? What is to be seen in her that makes her endearing? - In the old times, they knew how to suggest an atmosphere and a character in one shot. Today, we over explain. An example. In the old version, when we are first introduced to the Larabees, we see a painting of the family on the wall, then the family pausing for professional photographers. We know right there the pride, the arrogance of a rich family, the annoyed expression of Bogart, the delighted smile of his brother, the haughtiness of the mother etc.In the new version, we have a painfully long explanation of who is who, showing every character in turn. Another example? The ending, where Linus gets on the boat, asks for his hat to be arranged and sticks his umbrella on someone's coat belt, and we are meant to understand that he is at least on the same page as Sabrina. We don't need the again painful explanatory dialog of 10 minutes between the two leads. I could go on and on, scene by scene, from the chauffeur, to that round window showing the Eiffel tower and the french cook, to the beautiful ball dress Audrey is wearing and the witty short dialogs, the old version was a winner. The new version lacks subtlety and charm.

    Some people get very worked up over remakes of their favorite movies. I won't tell you that I particularly enjoy the experience; I don't. But as I watched this version of Sabrina, after having watched the previous one with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn, it occurred to me - my mind was wandering - that remakes of movies, like the originals, are like different performances of a given play. No one, I hope, would argue, after having seen a great production of Hamlet or Macbeth, that those plays should not be done again by others. Of course, one could ask why do them if the new company doesn't have something to justify yet another production of them. But there's no reason to argue against further productions in principle. That's how I feel about this version of Sabrina. There are things that I particularly enjoyed in the previous version that I didn't like here. I was very aggravated that this Sabrina did not learn the lessons of self-confidence in Paris that her predecessor did: those lines are cut out of this script, and when she goes to the Larabee party after her return from Paris, this Sabrina is a bundle of nerves - she has not learned self-confidence. This movie is also more often funny than the previous version. That would be a plus for those who want to laugh more during a movie. So, in the end, for me this was not as enjoyable a performance of the story of Sabrina as the previous one. But that's because the aspects of the story that interest me aren't focused on in this version as they were in the previous one. For someone else who is looking for and enjoys different things, this version might have more to offer. And such a person might give it a higher rating.

    Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Gregg Kinnear star in a remake of a 50's movie, originally starring Humphrey Bogart, called Sabrina. I hate to say it but I never saw that movie. But I did see this movie. This is a great movie. It's funny, and definitely romantic. The actors do a fantastic job. Especially Harrison Ford, playing the more likable brother. Harrison ford and Greg Kinnear play two brothers named Linus and David, sons of a tycoon in New York. David is engaged to one of their business partner's daughter(played by Lauren Holly). But he changes his mind when Sabrina(played by Julia Ormond), the daughter of their car driver and an old friend, returns from Paris. When she returns, the two of them plan on meeting up in the solarium. But that leads to an accident involving David. David's brother Linus has always had a crush on her too. So he offers to talk to her after the accident. While David lays injured in bed, Linus starts to hang out with her, and she soon starts to fall for him. Sabrina is a fantastic film. Sydney Pollack did such a great job making this movie. It's a shame he's not alive anymore.Cause he did great films. This was an odd one, and what was he doing in Made of honor? Lord knows. All of the actors do a great job. These are great actors. This is a great film. Sabrina: A

    "Sabrina" is a pretty easily likable romantic comedy, a genre of which I am a fan, even though it is hard to find good ones. This is a decent film, but now that I am comparing it to the 1954 original, it is easier for me to be critical. This movie has a good plot, some humor, and decent romance. Also, I am pleased to find movies like this with so little objectionable content, making it appropriate for the whole family, though the younger ones may not be completely interested. I hate to complain about this movie, but there are a few downsides. It runs too long overall, and it slows down too much toward the end. If you ask me, Harrison Ford doesn't really fit his role and seems to old and lifeless for the part he is intending to play. Also, I'm afraid Greg Kinnear simply cannot fill the brilliance of William Holden's shoes in the original. Julia Ormond takes Audrey Hepburn's role fairly well, but none of these three can possibly compare to the excellence of the original cast. The old film really was not outdated and didn't need to be updated, as films like "The Shop Around the Corner" or "The Parent Trap" did. Despite those things, I'm not going to criticize this film any more. It's good for a date film or when you don't want to think too hard but just want to be entertained and happy. I give it a slight recommendation, but I'd suggest the original with more priority. *** out of ****

    Desultory remake of the Billy Wilder classic. Julia Ormond gets the Audrey Hepburn role, and while those are pretty big shoes to fill, she could have at least tried to give a more compelling performance than the listless one she actually gives. "Sabrina" doesn't really work if you spend the whole movie wondering why any man would want to bother with such a wet noodle. Of course, the same could be said for the Harrison Ford character as well -- who'd want to waste her time on such a fuddy-duddy when the uber-charming Greg Kinnear is waiting in the background? Though Kinnear's charm oozes out so thickly you can practically see it, he manages to stay just this side of smarmy, making you wish the movie was about him. There's no compelling reason to see this as long as the original is out there available to rent. Grade: C

    Will go back to reread some of the quality IMDb user comments here. A couple of high level commentators can be viewed---above... Is Mom (1954) or Daughter (1995) "SABRINA" better? While I like Daughter SABRINA a tad better---I love both. There are NO LOSERS in this gentle debate... Both SABRINA versions not only have quality leads---they have great supporting casts. Here, maybe I like 1995 SABRINA a bit more---since the supporting characters are more familiar to me... As I write this, Nancy Marchand (as the Larrabee Matriarch) has made yet another one of her dry quips... Angie Dickinson well portrays the emptyheaded once-trophy wife of David's fianc&eacute;e's equally wealthy family - with Richard Crenna as her husband - And Lauren Holly is the result of the Tyson merger of beauty to brains/wealth - the smart yet beautiful Elisabeth Tyson, MD. - the first sensible female that woman chasing younger brother David has ever fallen for!!! The dialogue in 1995 is silky, gently ironic...and hey...all you would be scriptwriters, movie producers, etc. Study BOTH SABRINAS for how to make quality romantic films. +++++ (NOTE Amazingly, only one (clothed) short pre bedroom scene is in the 1995 version. 99% of this movie succeeds with just great script, production, casting, acting!!! What a novel concept!) Don't waste too much time debating what essentially is personal preference over which wonderful visual desert (Sabrina 1954 or Sabrina 1995) is better....Just see both!!!

    I thoroughly enjoyed this film, having watched it at least 20 times. I regret that my DVD had no behind-the-scenes commentary from the actors or director that many films on DVD offer. It would be great to hear from Harrison Ford or Julia Ormond giving their insights on the film. Julia Ormond dominated this film in every scene she was in. Having watched it so many times, it becomes clear that Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were deliberately creating scenes that she could dominate. In essence, the two male leads were effectively supporting actors. This tactic was great for the film, but acting egos being what they are, not a common occurrence in Hollywood. Julia has not received such support in her other films that I have seen. Something bothered me about the plot of Sabrina that I could not put my finger on. Then it hit me. What did Sabrina do all day? She helped her chauffeur father polish the Rolls-Royce and nothing more. She did not attend college or work as a servant on the Larrabee estate. Perhaps she worked as a domestic for her father in his quarters. How could a woman with such great potential have no discernible ambition? It was interesting to watch how much effort the people working at Vogue magazine devoted to transforming the awkward Sabrina that arrived at their doorstep into a polished and sophisticated woman. These people really invested themselves in helping Sabrina become the beautiful and self-confident woman of the second half of the movie. No wonder David Larrabee didn't recognize Sabrina when she returned from Paris. Harrison Ford is delicious as the scheming Linus Larrabee who sets out to hustle the naive chauffeur's daughter Sabrina. He has been so effective in outmaneuvering his business rivals, Sabrina is dead meat in his opinion. We can see his shifty eyes as he schemes to blindside her with his fake generosity and crocodile tears about his longing for a relationship with the right woman. He fakes pouring out his soul to Sabrina only to realize his revelations are all too genuine. We see him starting to really enjoy his time with Sabrina as she reveals what depths of soul she possesses. Linus is startled to find himself feeling jealousy over her attentions to her first love, David Larrabee. Greg Kinnear is perfect as the younger playboy brother, David Larrabee. David is as shallow as Linus is substantial. He has no higher ambition that to indulge in a series of romances with any attractive woman that crosses his path. He is maneuvered into proposing to his latest love interest after he expresses admiration for her skills as a physician. It turns out that the family of David's fianc&eacute;e has control of a company Linus has sought to incorporate into his own business empire. The family is willing to merge if David's marriage goes forward. All that goes out the window when a suddenly gorgeous Sabrina returns from a year in Paris. David is ready to chuck his fianc&eacute;e for a fling with the vulnerable Sabrina, who has always adored him. Of course, his plans for Sabrina extend no further than a few days of excitement and then off to the next conquest. Fortunatly for all concerned, Linus intervenes to prevent breaking David's engagement and losing the support that the wealthy family of the fianc&eacute;e promises to provide. Linus' pursuit of Sabrina allows her to see what a shallow man David really is and that her joy with David will be very short lived.

At any rate, we see the blissful couple on a bridge as the screen credits roll. Whether their love lasts is never resolved. In summary, even with the rough spots Sabrina is a great romantic film.
