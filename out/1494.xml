 <storyline>
  A vicious serial sex killer is on the loose, and landscape gardener and shop-window outfitter Loris is the prime suspect, thanks to his unfortunate habit of getting caught in compromising situations (for which there is always a totally innocent explanation that the police fail to spot). Undercover policewoman Jessica is assigned by eccentric police psychologist Taccone to follow Loris and provide evidence for his arrest - but things don't quite go according to plan...

    You MUST watch this movie if you haven't. I watched it literally about 50 times, and I still want to watch it! This is only movie that made me laugh so hard, absolutely perfect comedy.. Roberto Benigni is a genius, he made best movie ever.. I cannot understand how someone gave anything less than 10/10, but it's because (as you can see) I am very impressed by it. The scene where he imitates alarm "on the phone", or the one where he steals in supermarket are something funniest that I've ever seen. And not only that is funny, but this movie has all ellements, for example love wins at the end :) Definitely watch this movie, NOW :) It deserves probably 214913824/1o, but I can give it just 10/10...

    &uml;A vicious serial sex killer is on the loosea monster&uml; This slapstick comedy relies heavily on one of Italy's best actors, Roberto Benigni. He won an Oscar for his comedic performance in Life is Beautiful, and we all know how difficult it is for an actor to win an Oscar in a comedy (it has only been done six times in its more than 80 years). But before there was Life is Beautiful, Benigni was already beginning to rise to fame with his film Il Mostro (The Monster). I was not impressed for the first 20 minutes or so because I found his performance over the top and a bit exaggerated. Benigni relies heavily on his physical comedy and many have compared him to the geniuses of Charles Chaplin or even Buster Keaton. I thought Benigni's performance was a bit too much, but as the film progressed I found the clever situations and dialogues pretty funny. He did a better job writing this film than he did acting as the laughs begin once we see how each one of his awkward situations are misinterpreted by the police. Even the great Federico Fellini has recognized the great talent of this man so it wouldn't be wise to ignore this man's work (except for Pinocchio, we can all skip that one). Benigni not only wrote and performed in this film; he also directed and produced it as well, but the true star of the movie is Nicoletta Braschi, his wife, who has worked alongside him in all his movies. This is a very funny comedy; it just takes a while to pick up because of all the silliness in the beginning. Il Mostro begins with a news report about a serial killer on the loose who has now killed 18 females over the years and police have no prime suspect, until an innocent man named Loris (Roberto Benigni) has the misfortune of hitting on the wrong woman. Loris is working as a landscape gardener during a party and after a mix up he hits on the wrong person and later even more unfortunate incidents involving a chainsaw convert him in the prime suspect. The police decide to follow this man around in order to find the evidence they need to capture him and Loris continues to get caught in unfortunate situations which only solidify the suspicions of the police force. An undercover policewoman named Jessica Rossetti (Nicoletta Braschi) is assigned the task to get close to Loris and try to seduce him in order for his murderous instinct to take place. Jessica does all she can in her power to seduce this innocent man and works along police psychologist Paride Taccone (Michel Blanc) who is very intrigued by his subject and confident this man is the monster. Several funny scenes take place, all involving this police mix up and catching Loris in rather unfortunate situations. The highlight of the film is probably the scene in which Loris and Jessica invite Paride and his wife for dinner and the psychologist analyzes him with the excuse that he is measuring him for a suit he is tailoring, all the while his wife suffering from nerves of having to be in the same room with the monster. I think that the movie is worth a rent because it has some very funny moments although the first half hour is pretty slow and dull. Braschi does a great job and plays a totally different role from the one in Life is Beautiful. She is more of an extrovert in this movie because she has to try to seduce Loris. The psychologist is also pretty funny and his stereotypical performance garnered several laughs in this film. Overall the slapstick comedy works and will have you smiling. The awkward situations that Loris gets in are a bit exaggerated, but the mix up is rather funny. The characters are one-dimensional, but that is the point in these slapstick comedies as they tend to be very stereotypical. This is a funny movie although it is not a masterpiece like Life is Beautiful was.

    I heard of this movie by Roberto Begnini some time ago, and after reading reviews of it who said it was a very good comedy, I decided to buy it. I watched it one evening and then, I got what I wanted out of it. I simply LOVED it. It is what they say; Begnini is a master of comedy, one of those not too many comedians who makes us laugh with our hearts instead of with our heads. The plot is simple: it centers around a man named Loris(Begnini), who is innocently suspected of being ''The monster'', a serial killer who brutally rapes and murders women around Rome, after he accidentally attacks a woman in a garage with a chainsaw. The police, frustrated by lack of evidence against Loris, decides to do an unusual trick to get the evidence they need: A female police officer named Jessica(Nicoletta Braschi, Begninis wife) moves in with Loris and attempts to provoke him into trying g to kill her. But since he is innocent, this leads to some very bizarre and, above all, very, very funny situations. This is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. The jokes are both original and hilarious, and all the actors are fantastic. The cinematography is excellent as well, and the music sets just the right tone.

    Il Mostro by the Italian master, Roberto Benigni, is his funniest among some very funny movies. The earlier comment to watch it in Italian with subtitles is essential. Some of the humour, both spoken and physical slapstick is a little hard at first for North Americans. Once you fall into the Italian sense of humour it will have you on the floor, Roberto Benigni is the twenty first century's Charlie Chaplin. It is optimum for enjoyment if you have lived in Italy, but not required. Go to Italy afterwards! Like Felleni and the Bertolucci brothers, Benigni reflects a lot of what is intrinsically Italian. Il Mostro is about a mix up, but what comedy is not, it is really about Roberto, the words, the way the words are said, the body gestures and his mastery of playing. You can fall in love with his visual poetry... then learn Italian. I also recommend the unsung, underrated, Son of Pink Panther, it gives a new twist to the Sellers' humour. It's all that Sellers was and more, this is the true successor to the Pink Panther series! If you like the style of Il Mostro then try the earlier Johnny Stecchino, it is classic Benigni as well!

    It seems that Roberto Begnini can't go wrong when it comes to comedy. In a way, he might be the last / only great comedian of our times, who writes, acts, and (usually)directs films at the same time. He alone keeps alive this classic tradition of films, which genre's rules are invented and perfected by such greatness's as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, not to mention director giant Federico Fellini. This one is also a warm-hearted, humane, and really funny, which gives an unusual yet very likable mix, especially in times of so-called humorous films with endless quantities of stupid fart jokes and toilet humor. There might be some flaws however, but none too disturbing. Recommended!

    the movie is built around Loris, the character played by Roberto Benigni. who delivers best performance. he is 100% belevable in this role. the movie has almost all classic ingredients of a great comedy and they work. Roberto Benigni's character captures that facet of most of us men at some point in our lives. a lazy and not so well organized guy, far from hansom looking, who'd like to have a lot of women and money, but not yet successful with neither, improvising plans and schemes to get them fast and easy, getting himself in trouble instead, and plunging into more trouble the more he tries to sort things out. eventually the police is after him (the police surveying tape is hilarious), as goofy as Benigni's character is, the police match him with style. they dispatch a bait to unleash the monster within, and Loris has to go great lengths to avoid unleashing that monster =)) watch this movie in Italian with subtitles, don't let some lousy dubbing spoil your experience.

    One of the best comedies I've ever seen! Benigni is a genius and his work as "Loris" is perfect. The script is simple, fun and full of "innocent" jokes! It's a comedy in it's definition. Pure, simple, it makes you laugh in a very sincere way, without the usual stupid jokes we see in sexual comedies nowadays! Remembers me a lot of Charlie Chaplin! The translation to Portuguese (Brazilian Portuguese) is very good, and you don't miss a lot, but if you have the chance to watch it with the original audio, do it! Benigni's acting is great!

    From the reviews, I was expecting a Peter Sellers Pink Panther type literate farce but instead found this movie to be a small string of Roberto's marvelous physical shtick wrapped up in fluff. Most of the slapstick situations were telegraphed from the forties. Even for a farce, the story is farcical. The movie started off with much promise but then almost immediately everyone began to chew scenery. Perhaps another director could have evened it out but I was bored. Humor is in the eye, so to speak, so take this with a grain since so many others seem to rate it funny. But my vote is it would make a great SNL skit but there is not enough of anything to make a full length movie. Your mileage may vary.

    a comedy from roberto benigni that is nothing short of brilliant. the laughs aren't as hearty as they were when i watched meet the parents or the 40 year old virgin the first time, and i can't tell yet if the laughs will have as much life as they have in my favorite comedy of all-time (planes, trains and automobiles); but the laughs in monster are good and plentiful. the humor is decidedly European, but really should translate to American audiences without trouble. on a related note - the film is in Italian, but the audio is recorded in post-production so it looks dubbed (a look i've always disliked, but i understand the economics of the decision). that said, don't be tempted to watch the film with the English audio track - it looks even worse and the translation is shoddy. stick with the Italian with subtitles. the premise finds benigni as a hapless, unemployed man who is (wrongly) suspected of being the infamous "monster" - a rapist/murderer who is on the loose throughout italy. the comedy is mostly absurdist stuff, but a lot of it is relatively heady in its execution. there's a lot of setup that goes into the execution of some of the gags, and, in some cases there are gags which pay bigger dividends later in the film. in this regard, the construction of the film reminded me of meet the parents because both films were clearly written and re-written several times. it's only with several re-writes that a film acquires this level of depth and efficiency. much of the film's humor derives from cases of mistaken identity, changes of perspective, and benigni's unique path through life. nicoletta braschi, who is married to benigni and starred across him in life is beautiful, is great in this film as well. she's sexy (which is required because of the film's far-fetched premise), funny, and complements benigni amazingly well. she plays an undercover cop who is charged with the task of luring benigni into showing his "true" self, thus providing the proof the police need to incarcerate him. as the film progresses we see braschi and benigni form a playful and fun relationship which adds a depth to the picture without bogging it down with trite sentimentality. add to this the fact that it pokes plenty of fun at shrinks and cops and you have a brilliantly drawn and realized comedy that should leave you wanting more. B+.

    Before Roberto Benigni proved himself capable of masterpieces with "Life is Beautiful" (why did he follow it up with that awful "Pinocchio"?), he made a number of zany comedies, including "Il Mostro" (called "The Monster" in English). After a string of murders, the police suspect builder Loris (Benigni). I should identify that they only have circumstantial evidence, but boy is it some funny circumstantial evidence! Having "learned" about this man, Jessica Rossetti (Nicoletta Braschi) agrees to help nail him. And let me tell you, what she does to try and provoke him into attacking her...well, let's just say that you can't possibly prepare yourself for how funny it is! A hilarious movie in every sense.

    a comedy from roberto benigni that is nothing short of brilliant. the laughs aren't as hearty as they were when i watched meet the parents or the 40 year old virgin the first time, and i can't tell yet if the laughs will have as much life as they have in my favorite comedy of all-time (planes, trains and automobiles); but the laughs in monster are good and plentiful. the humor is decidedly European, but really should translate to American audiences without trouble. on a related note - the film is in Italian, but the audio is recorded in post-production so it looks dubbed (a look i've always disliked, but i understand the economics of the decision). that said, don't be tempted to watch the film with the English audio track - it looks even worse and the translation is shoddy. stick with the Italian with subtitles. the premise finds benigni as a hapless, unemployed man who is (wrongly) suspected of being the infamous "monster" - a rapist/murderer who is on the loose throughout italy. the comedy is mostly absurdist stuff, but a lot of it is relatively heady in its execution. there's a lot of setup that goes into the execution of some of the gags, and, in some cases there are gags which pay bigger dividends later in the film. in this regard, the construction of the film reminded me of meet the parents because both films were clearly written and re-written several times. it's only with several re-writes that a film acquires this level of depth and efficiency. much of the film's humor derives from cases of mistaken identity, changes of perspective, and benigni's unique path through life. nicoletta braschi, who is married to benigni and starred across him in life is beautiful, is great in this film as well. she's sexy (which is required because of the film's far-fetched premise), funny, and complements benigni amazingly well. she plays an undercover cop who is charged with the task of luring benigni into showing his "true" self, thus providing the proof the police need to incarcerate him. as the film progresses we see braschi and benigni form a playful and fun relationship which adds a depth to the picture without bogging it down with trite sentimentality. add to this the fact that it pokes plenty of fun at shrinks and cops and you have a brilliantly drawn and realized comedy that should leave you wanting more. B+.

    Before Roberto Benigni proved himself capable of masterpieces with "Life is Beautiful" (why did he follow it up with that awful "Pinocchio"?), he made a number of zany comedies, including "Il Mostro" (called "The Monster" in English). After a string of murders, the police suspect builder Loris (Benigni). I should identify that they only have circumstantial evidence, but boy is it some funny circumstantial evidence! Having "learned" about this man, Jessica Rossetti (Nicoletta Braschi) agrees to help nail him. And let me tell you, what she does to try and provoke him into attacking her...well, let's just say that you can't possibly prepare yourself for how funny it is! A hilarious movie in every sense.

    You MUST watch this movie if you haven't. I watched it literally about 50 times, and I still want to watch it! This is only movie that made me laugh so hard, absolutely perfect comedy.. Roberto Benigni is a genius, he made best movie ever.. I cannot understand how someone gave anything less than 10/10, but it's because (as you can see) I am very impressed by it. The scene where he imitates alarm "on the phone", or the one where he steals in supermarket are something funniest that I've ever seen. And not only that is funny, but this movie has all ellements, for example love wins at the end :) Definitely watch this movie, NOW :) It deserves probably 214913824/1o, but I can give it just 10/10...

    &uml;A vicious serial sex killer is on the loosea monster&uml; This slapstick comedy relies heavily on one of Italy's best actors, Roberto Benigni. He won an Oscar for his comedic performance in Life is Beautiful, and we all know how difficult it is for an actor to win an Oscar in a comedy (it has only been done six times in its more than 80 years). But before there was Life is Beautiful, Benigni was already beginning to rise to fame with his film Il Mostro (The Monster). I was not impressed for the first 20 minutes or so because I found his performance over the top and a bit exaggerated. Benigni relies heavily on his physical comedy and many have compared him to the geniuses of Charles Chaplin or even Buster Keaton. I thought Benigni's performance was a bit too much, but as the film progressed I found the clever situations and dialogues pretty funny. He did a better job writing this film than he did acting as the laughs begin once we see how each one of his awkward situations are misinterpreted by the police. Even the great Federico Fellini has recognized the great talent of this man so it wouldn't be wise to ignore this man's work (except for Pinocchio, we can all skip that one). Benigni not only wrote and performed in this film; he also directed and produced it as well, but the true star of the movie is Nicoletta Braschi, his wife, who has worked alongside him in all his movies. This is a very funny comedy; it just takes a while to pick up because of all the silliness in the beginning. Il Mostro begins with a news report about a serial killer on the loose who has now killed 18 females over the years and police have no prime suspect, until an innocent man named Loris (Roberto Benigni) has the misfortune of hitting on the wrong woman. Loris is working as a landscape gardener during a party and after a mix up he hits on the wrong person and later even more unfortunate incidents involving a chainsaw convert him in the prime suspect. The police decide to follow this man around in order to find the evidence they need to capture him and Loris continues to get caught in unfortunate situations which only solidify the suspicions of the police force. An undercover policewoman named Jessica Rossetti (Nicoletta Braschi) is assigned the task to get close to Loris and try to seduce him in order for his murderous instinct to take place. Jessica does all she can in her power to seduce this innocent man and works along police psychologist Paride Taccone (Michel Blanc) who is very intrigued by his subject and confident this man is the monster. Several funny scenes take place, all involving this police mix up and catching Loris in rather unfortunate situations. The highlight of the film is probably the scene in which Loris and Jessica invite Paride and his wife for dinner and the psychologist analyzes him with the excuse that he is measuring him for a suit he is tailoring, all the while his wife suffering from nerves of having to be in the same room with the monster. I think that the movie is worth a rent because it has some very funny moments although the first half hour is pretty slow and dull. Braschi does a great job and plays a totally different role from the one in Life is Beautiful. She is more of an extrovert in this movie because she has to try to seduce Loris. The psychologist is also pretty funny and his stereotypical performance garnered several laughs in this film. Overall the slapstick comedy works and will have you smiling. The awkward situations that Loris gets in are a bit exaggerated, but the mix up is rather funny. The characters are one-dimensional, but that is the point in these slapstick comedies as they tend to be very stereotypical. This is a funny movie although it is not a masterpiece like Life is Beautiful was.

    I heard of this movie by Roberto Begnini some time ago, and after reading reviews of it who said it was a very good comedy, I decided to buy it. I watched it one evening and then, I got what I wanted out of it. I simply LOVED it. It is what they say; Begnini is a master of comedy, one of those not too many comedians who makes us laugh with our hearts instead of with our heads. The plot is simple: it centers around a man named Loris(Begnini), who is innocently suspected of being ''The monster'', a serial killer who brutally rapes and murders women around Rome, after he accidentally attacks a woman in a garage with a chainsaw. The police, frustrated by lack of evidence against Loris, decides to do an unusual trick to get the evidence they need: A female police officer named Jessica(Nicoletta Braschi, Begninis wife) moves in with Loris and attempts to provoke him into trying g to kill her. But since he is innocent, this leads to some very bizarre and, above all, very, very funny situations. This is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. The jokes are both original and hilarious, and all the actors are fantastic. The cinematography is excellent as well, and the music sets just the right tone.

    Il Mostro by the Italian master, Roberto Benigni, is his funniest among some very funny movies. The earlier comment to watch it in Italian with subtitles is essential. Some of the humour, both spoken and physical slapstick is a little hard at first for North Americans. Once you fall into the Italian sense of humour it will have you on the floor, Roberto Benigni is the twenty first century's Charlie Chaplin. It is optimum for enjoyment if you have lived in Italy, but not required. Go to Italy afterwards! Like Felleni and the Bertolucci brothers, Benigni reflects a lot of what is intrinsically Italian. Il Mostro is about a mix up, but what comedy is not, it is really about Roberto, the words, the way the words are said, the body gestures and his mastery of playing. You can fall in love with his visual poetry... then learn Italian. I also recommend the unsung, underrated, Son of Pink Panther, it gives a new twist to the Sellers' humour. It's all that Sellers was and more, this is the true successor to the Pink Panther series! If you like the style of Il Mostro then try the earlier Johnny Stecchino, it is classic Benigni as well!

    It seems that Roberto Begnini can't go wrong when it comes to comedy. In a way, he might be the last / only great comedian of our times, who writes, acts, and (usually)directs films at the same time. He alone keeps alive this classic tradition of films, which genre's rules are invented and perfected by such greatness's as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, not to mention director giant Federico Fellini. This one is also a warm-hearted, humane, and really funny, which gives an unusual yet very likable mix, especially in times of so-called humorous films with endless quantities of stupid fart jokes and toilet humor. There might be some flaws however, but none too disturbing. Recommended!

    the movie is built around Loris, the character played by Roberto Benigni. who delivers best performance. he is 100% belevable in this role. the movie has almost all classic ingredients of a great comedy and they work. Roberto Benigni's character captures that facet of most of us men at some point in our lives. a lazy and not so well organized guy, far from hansom looking, who'd like to have a lot of women and money, but not yet successful with neither, improvising plans and schemes to get them fast and easy, getting himself in trouble instead, and plunging into more trouble the more he tries to sort things out. eventually the police is after him (the police surveying tape is hilarious), as goofy as Benigni's character is, the police match him with style. they dispatch a bait to unleash the monster within, and Loris has to go great lengths to avoid unleashing that monster =)) watch this movie in Italian with subtitles, don't let some lousy dubbing spoil your experience.

    One of the best comedies I've ever seen! Benigni is a genius and his work as "Loris" is perfect. The script is simple, fun and full of "innocent" jokes! It's a comedy in it's definition. Pure, simple, it makes you laugh in a very sincere way, without the usual stupid jokes we see in sexual comedies nowadays! Remembers me a lot of Charlie Chaplin! The translation to Portuguese (Brazilian Portuguese) is very good, and you don't miss a lot, but if you have the chance to watch it with the original audio, do it! Benigni's acting is great!

    From the reviews, I was expecting a Peter Sellers Pink Panther type literate farce but instead found this movie to be a small string of Roberto's marvelous physical shtick wrapped up in fluff. Most of the slapstick situations were telegraphed from the forties. Even for a farce, the story is farcical. The movie started off with much promise but then almost immediately everyone began to chew scenery. Perhaps another director could have evened it out but I was bored. Humor is in the eye, so to speak, so take this with a grain since so many others seem to rate it funny. But my vote is it would make a great SNL skit but there is not enough of anything to make a full length movie. Your mileage may vary.
