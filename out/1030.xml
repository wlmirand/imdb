 <sinopse>
  A feature adaptation of the classic TV show, when nice guy redneck Jed Clampett strikes it rich when he finds black oil, and moves he and his kin to posh Beverly Hills.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Jed Clampett and kin move from Arkansas to Beverly Hills when he becomes a billionaire, after an oil strike. The country folk are very naive with regard to life in the big city, so when Jed starts a search for a new wife there are inevitably plenty of takers and con artists ready to make a fast buck.

    Hollywood has produced uncountable numbers of remakes of old TV shows from the 1960's and 70's. I can't even begin to count them or make a list. I've seen some of them. A few have worked; most have been dreadful. This 1993 movie based on the 60's series of the same name falls somewhere in between those two categories, probably leaning a bit toward the dreadful side, but not dreadful in and of itself. The basic plot follows the TV story. Hillbilly Jed Clampett (played here by Jim Varney) strikes it rich one day when he was "shootin' at some food, and up from the ground come a-bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Black gold. Texas tea." (Couldn't resist!) Suddenly rich after he's paid $1 billion for his land, his family tells him that "Californy is the place you ought to be, so they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly. Hills that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars." (Couldn't resist again!) So, once more Jed, Granny (Cloris Leachman), Ellie May (Erike Eleniak) and cousin Jethro (Diedrich Bader) are left to the task of settling into their new life with the help of Mr. Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) and Miss Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) and along for the ride we get a couple of villains played by Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson, who set out to get Jed's money for themselves. This lacked the fun of the TV series. There were parts of it that were amusing. The Clampetts driving along the highway thinking that the middle finger was a California greeting springs to mind, for example. Overall, though, it really wasn't that funny. The cast was so-so. Varney and Leachman were all right. Eleniak, to me, didn't really capture Ellie May's sweet innocence, and Bader as Jethro didn't work for me. Jethro in the TV series was a dumb character, yes, but Bader's Jethro was both too dumb and too underplayed. Bader seemed to think he just had to look and sound stupid and that would be enough. He missed the mark completely. I don't think the Beverly Hillbillies work that well as a movie, either. As a TV series it was fine. You got it in half hour chunks (less counting commercials) and that was enough. Trying to keep it going for over an hour and a half without a break became tiresome after a while. Dolly Parton was included as herself as, I guess, an entertainer the Clampetts (with their country background) would be familiar with. Aside from being recognizable, though, that didn't really do much for me, since I'm not a big Dolly fan. One appearance that did work, though, was from Buddy Ebsen. He, of course, was the original Jed Clampett on the TV series. It was a rather ingenious thought to bring him back for this movie, this time as the other well known character he played on television - private detective Barnaby Jones from the 1970's, whom Miss Hathaway hires to investigate the plot to get Jed's money. When the Barnaby Jones theme started to play I smiled, because right away I knew what (and who) was coming. Ebsen played it perfectly straight, when everyone else often seemed to be trying too hard for laughs. As a result, he was perfect. It's not the worst remake of a TV series. Not by far actually. But it can't honestly be called good either, and with the TV series being just perfect at a half hour per episode, this started to get tired even before the one hour mark had hit. There just isn't really enough meat to the Clampetts to make a movie about them. (5/10)

    It's become a clich&eacute; that modern adaptations of classic TV shows are among the worst movies of all. "The Flintstones" was simply a BAD movie in every way! While there have been a few bright spots ("The Addams Family" and "Charlie's Angels") pretty much everything else has been execrable. This modern adaptation of the Clampett brood has some funny stuff but mostly isn't worth the time. One could make the argument that "The Beverly Hillbillies" is half-homage, half-parody. Even so, this was a letdown for Penelope Spheeris after "Wayne's World". It was interesting to see Jim Varney in a non-Ernest role, though. Also starring Cloris Leachman, Erika Eleniak (the girl kissed by Elliott in "ET"), Lily Tomlin, Dabney Coleman and Rob Schneider.

    This was a big disappointment because I expected more of the series. The roles of Jethro, the banker and prospective bride were awful. The roles of father and daughter were well written and well performed. Tomlinson also did a great job. But the writing for the other characters was awful and the acting was either awful or possibly well performed to an awful script. The main objection I have to the film is that it is demeaning to hillbillys. The original series was entertaining in pointing out the difference between Hollywood and Arkansas without depicting the characters as stupid. This film paints a false picture of not just ignorance, but of stupididy on the part of the hillbillys.

    While others seemed quite surprised at Varney's dramatic performance as Jed as being excellent(most associate him with lovable Ernest P. Worrell), I was not surprised. I love the Ernest character and the entire Ernest genre. With Varney being able to pull off a multitude of characters and voices(over 61), I wasn't shocked at his performance as the serious Jed Clampett. It was refreshing to see him play the straight role while the comedy was happening around him. I've always wanted to see Varney in dramatic roles as well and knew he had it in him to do so. Varney was the perfect choice for Jed and no one could've done better. Ebsen should be proud. I must admit, I was so used to seeing Varney as Ernest that I WAS shocked when I saw 'Jed' come down the stairs in a black hat, white shirt and black pants. The first thing I thought was, "Weeeee, Doggie. Sexy." I couldn't help myself. I'm from Alabama, and I know that the accents were somewhat forced on some parts like Elly Mae's but Varney's was dead on. Since he was born in Kentucky and lived in Tennessee, how could it not? With Tomlin, Parton and Coleman, it felt like a 9-5 reunion. Bader playing the moronic Jethro cracked me up especially when he 'figured' out how to bowl. Leachman as Granny was perfect. Being such a small little thing, she has a big personality. I remember watching her as the witch in 'Hansel and Gretal' and just loving the performance. Another hilarious scene was how the Clampett's gave everyone on the interstate the bird because they honestly thought that was how people said hello in 'Californy'. One of my favorite parts was when two hooligans come up beside them after being cut off by Jethro, and pull a gun. Jed stands up, points a huge rifle at them and says, "That's real nice, son. This here's what I carry." The two guys speed away. I grew up watching some of the reruns of the original 'Beverly Hillbillies'. And the movie is a nice parody of the original, but keeping true to the story and characters. Jim sang a version of 'Hot Rod Lincoln' and it was just excellent. Not only did he had a wonderful singing voice, he was also very articulate. I recommend this movie. If you're a Varney fan then I highly recommend you get this and enjoy!!

    Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie Everybody did an awesome job, and was a great tribute to the classic series! When Jed Clampett is hunting, he accidentally finds oil, and is given 2 billion dollars. He takes Elly May, Granny, and Jethro to Bevery Hills to live the sweet life. When arriving at their mansion, Miss Hathaway thinks they are criminals, because of the way they dress. After everything is sorted out, Jed wants to get married. He falls in love with a beautiful con artist named Laura Jackson, who is only after his money. Soon, it's up to Granny and Miss Hathaway to stop the wedding. I highly recommend THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES!!! Yall come back now, ya hear?

    While this movie is not NEARLY as good as the classic TV series, I thought it was very well made. And I thought the cast (with the exception of Jethro and Miss Jane Hatheway) did a mighty fine job of recreating the characters. Jedediah (Jed) Clampett 7/10 I of course liked Buddy Ebsen better, but Jim Varney does a good job of playing this billionaire hillbilly. Daisy (Granny) Moses 9/10 Before I watched this movie, I thought to myself "Nobody can replace Irene Ryan". I was right. Sort of. Cloris Leachman did a very, VERY good job. If not for Ryan before her, she would have been perfect. But, as perfect as she was, Irene Ryan was not just a perfect Granny, she WAS Granny Clampett. Jethro Bodine 3/10 Max Baer Junior was better. Way better. The replacement was too corny, and stupid. (Baer was corny and stupid too, but in a funnier way. Not in this new...Jim Carrey way.) Elly May Clampett 12/10 ;) Believe it or not, I actually liked the replacement better. Donna Douglas exaggerated the role a little too much for me. And the new Elly had a more rugged look to her. Whereas Douglas looked too much like a beauty pageant contestant, and not someone who had spent their life "rassling" with the "critters". Pearl Bodine 8/10 She was in it very little, but she did a good job. Again, it would have been a great job if not for the original.(names fail me. lol) Milburn Drysdale 6/10 Not bad, but the replacement was a little old. Miss Jane Hatheway 2/10 Yikes! I did not like her at ALL! She tried to hard to act like Nancy Kulp, refusing to recognize the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to act like Nancy Kulp! She exaggerated the role WAYYYY to much! (so did Kulp, but with her it came out funny, and it fit her character. With the replacement, it came out...exaggerated!) Storyline 6/10 The plot is similar to the plots of the original episodes: Jed wants to get "hitched" so he can have a wife that will raise the rambunctious tomboy Elly to be "proper", Elly likes to "rassle", swim in the cement pond with her critters, and climb trees, Jethro tries to be a "Hollywood bachelor", Drysdale, aided by his *faithful* secretary, struggle to keep the Clampett account safe in the Commerce bank, and con-men of all sorts try every means possible to swindle money out of the Clampetts, all the while being unknowingly foiled by the Clueless, Trusting Clampetts. The only drawback is that the misadventures tend to be more on the PG side rather than the Family-Friendly TV series of the 60's/70's. (okay, a LOT more) All-in-all, I give it seven stars out of ten stars, and I recommend it as a must-see for any Beverly Hillbillies fanatic! I mean, fan.

    After watching The Beverly Hillbillies Movie and being a big fan of Jim Varney I fell completely in love with this movie! One of my favorites! In the movie Jed Clampett(Jim Varney) becomes a millionaire and moves his family, daughter Ellie May(Erika Eleniak) mother-in-law Granny(Cloris Leachman) and nephew Jethro to Beverly Hills and he's looking to get hitched and falls in lobe with this woman(Lea Thompson) hoping that she'd be perfect to raise his daughter not knowing that she and her partner(Rob Schneider) in of his great character roles are planning to steal his money! Filled with hilarious scenes including the scene where the guy in the jeep say Hey! Nick wheels Buddy! and flicks the Clampetts off and Jed asks Jethro why do you suppose that fellers pointing at us? And Jethro answers Reckon that's how they say howdy in Californie! And then later they do it to Mr. Drysdale(Dabney Coleman) not knowing who he is! That was really hilarious! I just jumped out of my seat laughing! I also liked the scene when Dolly Parton shows up to sing Jed Happy Birthday and Jed(Jim Varmey) smiles with delight! It was just wonderful! Filled with hilarious scenes, bloopers, great story, and wonderful actors and actresses Beverly Hillbillies is one of the greatest movies ever! I will always Charisse the memories of one of the greatest actors in this movie Jim Varney! God bless you Jim Varney 1949-2000! 10 out of 10!

    Oh no, not again! Yes it's yet another classic t.v. favourite forcing itself upon us on the big screen. This time it's the good ole"Beverly Hillbillies" who have made what I call without hesitation the 'dreaded transition'. The new cast, led by Jim Varney (Jed), Diedrich Bader (Jethro), Erica Eleniak (Elly May) and Cloris Leachman (Granny), with support from Dabney Coleman, Lily Tomlin, Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider, all manage to resurrect the familiar faces of the Clampett clan, but apart from that they do little. And as for the plot, which is damn near awful, it seems to have borrowed rather form "The Addams Family" and "Addams Family Values", with its story of deceitful persons attempting to get their hands on the Clampett fortune. All amounts to an incredibly corny, unfunny show that's as flat as a pancake. (How does it take four writers to come up with this drivel? Perhaps less is more?). Funniest moment occurs during the closing credits which feature some of the film's bloopers. Guest starred Dolly Parton, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Buddy Ebsen. Saturday, October 19, 1996 - T.V.

    I didn't watch this movie until a few years after it came out. I was just thinking to myself "Oh, no!!, another remake." It just didn't seem to catch my eye. One night, out of sheer boredom I watched it. To my surprise, I was entertained by this movie. I was amazed by the perfect casting involved, everyone was perfect! The subplot was a little weak, but held true to the series, everyone always trying to get at Jeb's fortune. Overall I found it entertaining and funny. If you go in without expecting too much, just hoping for some lighter fare, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Just picture each character with the new cast; its perfect!!!

    This film based on successful TV series by Paul Henning. It begins when mountaineer Jed accidentally discovers a surprise in his property because he has struck oil during a shooting, gotten million of dollars, and turning instantly billionaire . Then he packs his backwoods family and heads to Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.They change into a lush mansion , but still live like Hillbillies because they still dress tattered ragged suits and rustics costumes .The hillbillies clan are Jed(Jim Varney in the role of Buddy Ebsen), a good-hearted and kind father looking new spouse, his daughter Elly May(Erika Elinak, role of Donna Douglas),an extraordinary gorgeous but incredibly ingenious and pursued by a suitor(Kevin Connolly), the Granny(Cloris Leachman), a senile, paranoid and obstinate old woman and Jethro(Dietrich Vader, role of Max Baer) , he's idiot though strong, he's actually only acting like an authentic stupid and doesn't even realize it. Besides, the ambitious banker(Dabney Coleman) and his botcher helper(Lily Tomlin) who will make anything of keep the Camplett family money in his bank. Meanwhile, they are duped by a mean pair(Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider). Everyone casting does rightly their impersonations from television characters with special mention of Jim Varney as the sensible and good father looking for wife and particularly, Dietrich as a double role as the dumb Jethro and his sister, furthermore a likable Granny, well incarnated by Cloris Leachman. Appear special cameos, Zsa Zsa Gabor as a delinquent, Dolly Parton singing country music and Buddy Ebsen, the original Jed , reprises another of his television acting, Barnaby Jones.The film contains a stunning music score with ballads by Scoggins like the original series, songs by Dolly Parton and Hank Williams and soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin. The motion picture is regularly directed by Penelope Scpheeris. Rating: Average but amusing. The film will like to nostalgics and hardcore series fans.

Daisy (Granny) Moses 9/10 Before I watched this movie, I thought to myself "Nobody can replace Irene Ryan". I was right. Sort of. Cloris Leachman did a very, VERY good job. If not for Ryan before her, she would have been perfect. But, as perfect as she was, Irene Ryan was not just a perfect Granny, she WAS Granny Clampett. Jethro Bodine 3/10 Max Baer Junior was better. Way better. The replacement was too corny, and stupid. (Baer was corny and stupid too, but in a funnier way. Not in this new...Jim Carrey way.) Elly May Clampett 12/10 ;) Believe it or not, I actually liked the replacement better. Donna Douglas exaggerated the role a little too much for me. And the new Elly had a more rugged look to her. Whereas Douglas looked too much like a beauty pageant contestant, and not someone who had spent their life "rassling" with the "critters". Pearl Bodine 8/10 She was in it very little, but she did a good job. Again, it would have been a great job if not for the original.(names fail me. lol) Milburn Drysdale 6/10 Not bad, but the replacement was a little old. Miss Jane Hatheway 2/10 Yikes! I did not like her at ALL! She tried to hard to act like Nancy Kulp, refusing to recognize the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to act like Nancy Kulp! She exaggerated the role WAYYYY to much! (so did Kulp, but with her it came out funny, and it fit her character. With the replacement, it came out...exaggerated!) Storyline 6/10 The plot is similar to the plots of the original episodes: Jed wants to get "hitched" so he can have a wife that will raise the rambunctious tomboy Elly to be "proper", Elly likes to "rassle", swim in the cement pond with her critters, and climb trees, Jethro tries to be a "Hollywood bachelor", Drysdale, aided by his *faithful* secretary, struggle to keep the Clampett account safe in the Commerce bank, and con-men of all sorts try every means possible to swindle money out of the Clampetts, all the while being unknowingly foiled by the Clueless, Trusting Clampetts. The only drawback is that the misadventures tend to be more on the PG side rather than the Family-Friendly TV series of the 60's/70's. (okay, a LOT more) All-in-all, I give it seven stars out of ten stars, and I recommend it as a must-see for any Beverly Hillbillies fanatic! I mean, fan.

    After watching The Beverly Hillbillies Movie and being a big fan of Jim Varney I fell completely in love with this movie! One of my favorites! In the movie Jed Clampett(Jim Varney) becomes a millionaire and moves his family, daughter Ellie May(Erika Eleniak) mother-in-law Granny(Cloris Leachman) and nephew Jethro to Beverly Hills and he's looking to get hitched and falls in lobe with this woman(Lea Thompson) hoping that she'd be perfect to raise his daughter not knowing that she and her partner(Rob Schneider) in of his great character roles are planning to steal his money! Filled with hilarious scenes including the scene where the guy in the jeep say Hey! Nick wheels Buddy! and flicks the Clampetts off and Jed asks Jethro why do you suppose that fellers pointing at us? And Jethro answers Reckon that's how they say howdy in Californie! And then later they do it to Mr. Drysdale(Dabney Coleman) not knowing who he is! That was really hilarious! I just jumped out of my seat laughing! I also liked the scene when Dolly Parton shows up to sing Jed Happy Birthday and Jed(Jim Varmey) smiles with delight! It was just wonderful! Filled with hilarious scenes, bloopers, great story, and wonderful actors and actresses Beverly Hillbillies is one of the greatest movies ever! I will always Charisse the memories of one of the greatest actors in this movie Jim Varney! God bless you Jim Varney 1949-2000! 10 out of 10!

    Oh no, not again! Yes it's yet another classic t.v. favourite forcing itself upon us on the big screen. This time it's the good ole"Beverly Hillbillies" who have made what I call without hesitation the 'dreaded transition'. The new cast, led by Jim Varney (Jed), Diedrich Bader (Jethro), Erica Eleniak (Elly May) and Cloris Leachman (Granny), with support from Dabney Coleman, Lily Tomlin, Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider, all manage to resurrect the familiar faces of the Clampett clan, but apart from that they do little. And as for the plot, which is damn near awful, it seems to have borrowed rather form "The Addams Family" and "Addams Family Values", with its story of deceitful persons attempting to get their hands on the Clampett fortune. All amounts to an incredibly corny, unfunny show that's as flat as a pancake. (How does it take four writers to come up with this drivel? Perhaps less is more?). Funniest moment occurs during the closing credits which feature some of the film's bloopers. Guest starred Dolly Parton, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Buddy Ebsen. Saturday, October 19, 1996 - T.V.

    I didn't watch this movie until a few years after it came out. I was just thinking to myself "Oh, no!!, another remake." It just didn't seem to catch my eye. One night, out of sheer boredom I watched it. To my surprise, I was entertained by this movie. I was amazed by the perfect casting involved, everyone was perfect! The subplot was a little weak, but held true to the series, everyone always trying to get at Jeb's fortune. Overall I found it entertaining and funny. If you go in without expecting too much, just hoping for some lighter fare, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Just picture each character with the new cast; its perfect!!!

    This film based on successful TV series by Paul Henning. It begins when mountaineer Jed accidentally discovers a surprise in his property because he has struck oil during a shooting, gotten million of dollars, and turning instantly billionaire . Then he packs his backwoods family and heads to Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.They change into a lush mansion , but still live like Hillbillies because they still dress tattered ragged suits and rustics costumes .The hillbillies clan are Jed(Jim Varney in the role of Buddy Ebsen), a good-hearted and kind father looking new spouse, his daughter Elly May(Erika Elinak, role of Donna Douglas),an extraordinary gorgeous but incredibly ingenious and pursued by a suitor(Kevin Connolly), the Granny(Cloris Leachman), a senile, paranoid and obstinate old woman and Jethro(Dietrich Vader, role of Max Baer) , he's idiot though strong, he's actually only acting like an authentic stupid and doesn't even realize it. Besides, the ambitious banker(Dabney Coleman) and his botcher helper(Lily Tomlin) who will make anything of keep the Camplett family money in his bank. Meanwhile, they are duped by a mean pair(Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider). Everyone casting does rightly their impersonations from television characters with special mention of Jim Varney as the sensible and good father looking for wife and particularly, Dietrich as a double role as the dumb Jethro and his sister, furthermore a likable Granny, well incarnated by Cloris Leachman. Appear special cameos, Zsa Zsa Gabor as a delinquent, Dolly Parton singing country music and Buddy Ebsen, the original Jed , reprises another of his television acting, Barnaby Jones.The film contains a stunning music score with ballads by Scoggins like the original series, songs by Dolly Parton and Hank Williams and soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin.

    Hollywood has produced uncountable numbers of remakes of old TV shows from the 1960's and 70's. I can't even begin to count them or make a list. I've seen some of them. A few have worked; most have been dreadful. This 1993 movie based on the 60's series of the same name falls somewhere in between those two categories, probably leaning a bit toward the dreadful side, but not dreadful in and of itself. The basic plot follows the TV story. Hillbilly Jed Clampett (played here by Jim Varney) strikes it rich one day when he was "shootin' at some food, and up from the ground come a-bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Black gold. Texas tea." (Couldn't resist!) Suddenly rich after he's paid $1 billion for his land, his family tells him that "Californy is the place you ought to be, so they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly. Hills that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars." (Couldn't resist again!) So, once more Jed, Granny (Cloris Leachman), Ellie May (Erike Eleniak) and cousin Jethro (Diedrich Bader) are left to the task of settling into their new life with the help of Mr. Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) and Miss Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) and along for the ride we get a couple of villains played by Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson, who set out to get Jed's money for themselves. This lacked the fun of the TV series. There were parts of it that were amusing. The Clampetts driving along the highway thinking that the middle finger was a California greeting springs to mind, for example. Overall, though, it really wasn't that funny. The cast was so-so. Varney and Leachman were all right. Eleniak, to me, didn't really capture Ellie May's sweet innocence, and Bader as Jethro didn't work for me. Jethro in the TV series was a dumb character, yes, but Bader's Jethro was both too dumb and too underplayed. Bader seemed to think he just had to look and sound stupid and that would be enough. He missed the mark completely. I don't think the Beverly Hillbillies work that well as a movie, either. As a TV series it was fine. You got it in half hour chunks (less counting commercials) and that was enough. Trying to keep it going for over an hour and a half without a break became tiresome after a while. Dolly Parton was included as herself as, I guess, an entertainer the Clampetts (with their country background) would be familiar with. Aside from being recognizable, though, that didn't really do much for me, since I'm not a big Dolly fan. One appearance that did work, though, was from Buddy Ebsen. He, of course, was the original Jed Clampett on the TV series. It was a rather ingenious thought to bring him back for this movie, this time as the other well known character he played on television - private detective Barnaby Jones from the 1970's, whom Miss Hathaway hires to investigate the plot to get Jed's money. When the Barnaby Jones theme started to play I smiled, because right away I knew what (and who) was coming. Ebsen played it perfectly straight, when everyone else often seemed to be trying too hard for laughs. As a result, he was perfect. It's not the worst remake of a TV series. Not by far actually. But it can't honestly be called good either, and with the TV series being just perfect at a half hour per episode, this started to get tired even before the one hour mark had hit. There just isn't really enough meat to the Clampetts to make a movie about them. (5/10)

    It's become a clich&eacute; that modern adaptations of classic TV shows are among the worst movies of all. "The Flintstones" was simply a BAD movie in every way! While there have been a few bright spots ("The Addams Family" and "Charlie's Angels") pretty much everything else has been execrable. This modern adaptation of the Clampett brood has some funny stuff but mostly isn't worth the time. One could make the argument that "The Beverly Hillbillies" is half-homage, half-parody. Even so, this was a letdown for Penelope Spheeris after "Wayne's World". It was interesting to see Jim Varney in a non-Ernest role, though. Also starring Cloris Leachman, Erika Eleniak (the girl kissed by Elliott in "ET"), Lily Tomlin, Dabney Coleman and Rob Schneider.

    This was a big disappointment because I expected more of the series. The roles of Jethro, the banker and prospective bride were awful. The roles of father and daughter were well written and well performed. Tomlinson also did a great job. But the writing for the other characters was awful and the acting was either awful or possibly well performed to an awful script. The main objection I have to the film is that it is demeaning to hillbillys. The original series was entertaining in pointing out the difference between Hollywood and Arkansas without depicting the characters as stupid. This film paints a false picture of not just ignorance, but of stupididy on the part of the hillbillys.

    While others seemed quite surprised at Varney's dramatic performance as Jed as being excellent(most associate him with lovable Ernest P. Worrell), I was not surprised. I love the Ernest character and the entire Ernest genre. With Varney being able to pull off a multitude of characters and voices(over 61), I wasn't shocked at his performance as the serious Jed Clampett. It was refreshing to see him play the straight role while the comedy was happening around him. I've always wanted to see Varney in dramatic roles as well and knew he had it in him to do so. Varney was the perfect choice for Jed and no one could've done better. Ebsen should be proud. I must admit, I was so used to seeing Varney as Ernest that I WAS shocked when I saw 'Jed' come down the stairs in a black hat, white shirt and black pants. The first thing I thought was, "Weeeee, Doggie. Sexy." I couldn't help myself. I'm from Alabama, and I know that the accents were somewhat forced on some parts like Elly Mae's but Varney's was dead on. Since he was born in Kentucky and lived in Tennessee, how could it not? With Tomlin, Parton and Coleman, it felt like a 9-5 reunion. Bader playing the moronic Jethro cracked me up especially when he 'figured' out how to bowl. Leachman as Granny was perfect. Being such a small little thing, she has a big personality. I remember watching her as the witch in 'Hansel and Gretal' and just loving the performance. Another hilarious scene was how the Clampett's gave everyone on the interstate the bird because they honestly thought that was how people said hello in 'Californy'. One of my favorite parts was when two hooligans come up beside them after being cut off by Jethro, and pull a gun. Jed stands up, points a huge rifle at them and says, "That's real nice, son. This here's what I carry." The two guys speed away. I grew up watching some of the reruns of the original 'Beverly Hillbillies'. And the movie is a nice parody of the original, but keeping true to the story and characters. Jim sang a version of 'Hot Rod Lincoln' and it was just excellent. Not only did he had a wonderful singing voice, he was also very articulate. I recommend this movie. If you're a Varney fan then I highly recommend you get this and enjoy!!

    Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie Everybody did an awesome job, and was a great tribute to the classic series! When Jed Clampett is hunting, he accidentally finds oil, and is given 2 billion dollars. He takes Elly May, Granny, and Jethro to Bevery Hills to live the sweet life. When arriving at their mansion, Miss Hathaway thinks they are criminals, because of the way they dress. After everything is sorted out, Jed wants to get married. He falls in love with a beautiful con artist named Laura Jackson, who is only after his money. Soon, it's up to Granny and Miss Hathaway to stop the wedding. I highly recommend THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES!!! Yall come back now, ya hear?

    While this movie is not NEARLY as good as the classic TV series, I thought it was very well made. And I thought the cast (with the exception of Jethro and Miss Jane Hatheway) did a mighty fine job of recreating the characters. Jedediah (Jed) Clampett 7/10 I of course liked Buddy Ebsen better, but Jim Varney does a good job of playing this billionaire hillbilly. Daisy (Granny) Moses 9/10 Before I watched this movie, I thought to myself "Nobody can replace Irene Ryan". I was right. Sort of. Cloris Leachman did a very, VERY good job. If not for Ryan before her, she would have been perfect. But, as perfect as she was, Irene Ryan was not just a perfect Granny, she WAS Granny Clampett. Jethro Bodine 3/10 Max Baer Junior was better. Way better. The replacement was too corny, and stupid. (Baer was corny and stupid too, but in a funnier way. Not in this new...Jim Carrey way.) Elly May Clampett 12/10 ;) Believe it or not, I actually liked the replacement better. Donna Douglas exaggerated the role a little too much for me. And the new Elly had a more rugged look to her.

    Hollywood has produced uncountable numbers of remakes of old TV shows from the 1960's and 70's. I can't even begin to count them or make a list. I've seen some of them. A few have worked; most have been dreadful. This 1993 movie based on the 60's series of the same name falls somewhere in between those two categories, probably leaning a bit toward the dreadful side, but not dreadful in and of itself. The basic plot follows the TV story. Hillbilly Jed Clampett (played here by Jim Varney) strikes it rich one day when he was "shootin' at some food, and up from the ground come a-bubblin' crude.

Swimming pools. Movie stars." (Couldn't resist again!) So, once more Jed, Granny (Cloris Leachman), Ellie May (Erike Eleniak) and cousin Jethro (Diedrich Bader) are left to the task of settling into their new life with the help of Mr. Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) and Miss Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) and along for the ride we get a couple of villains played by Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson, who set out to get Jed's money for themselves. This lacked the fun of the TV series. There were parts of it that were amusing. The Clampetts driving along the highway thinking that the middle finger was a California greeting springs to mind, for example. Overall, though, it really wasn't that funny. The cast was so-so. Varney and Leachman were all right. Eleniak, to me, didn't really capture Ellie May's sweet innocence, and Bader as Jethro didn't work for me. Jethro in the TV series was a dumb character, yes, but Bader's Jethro was both too dumb and too underplayed. Bader seemed to think he just had to look and sound stupid and that would be enough. He missed the mark completely. I don't think the Beverly Hillbillies work that well as a movie, either. As a TV series it was fine.

Dolly Parton was included as herself as, I guess, an entertainer the Clampetts (with their country background) would be familiar with. Aside from being recognizable, though, that didn't really do much for me, since I'm not a big Dolly fan. One appearance that did work, though, was from Buddy Ebsen. He, of course, was the original Jed Clampett on the TV series. It was a rather ingenious thought to bring him back for this movie, this time as the other well known character he played on television - private detective Barnaby Jones from the 1970's, whom Miss Hathaway hires to investigate the plot to get Jed's money. When the Barnaby Jones theme started to play I smiled, because right away I knew what (and who) was coming. Ebsen played it perfectly straight, when everyone else often seemed to be trying too hard for laughs. As a result, he was perfect. It's not the worst remake of a TV series. Not by far actually. But it can't honestly be called good either, and with the TV series being just perfect at a half hour per episode, this started to get tired even before the one hour mark had hit. There just isn't really enough meat to the Clampetts to make a movie about them. (5/10)

    It's become a clich&eacute; that modern adaptations of classic TV shows are among the worst movies of all. "The Flintstones" was simply a BAD movie in every way! While there have been a few bright spots ("The Addams Family" and "Charlie's Angels") pretty much everything else has been execrable. This modern adaptation of the Clampett brood has some funny stuff but mostly isn't worth the time. One could make the argument that "The Beverly Hillbillies" is half-homage, half-parody. Even so, this was a letdown for Penelope Spheeris after "Wayne's World". It was interesting to see Jim Varney in a non-Ernest role, though. Also starring Cloris Leachman, Erika Eleniak (the girl kissed by Elliott in "ET"), Lily Tomlin, Dabney Coleman and Rob Schneider.

    This was a big disappointment because I expected more of the series. The roles of Jethro, the banker and prospective bride were awful. The roles of father and daughter were well written and well performed. Tomlinson also did a great job. But the writing for the other characters was awful and the acting was either awful or possibly well performed to an awful script. The main objection I have to the film is that it is demeaning to hillbillys. The original series was entertaining in pointing out the difference between Hollywood and Arkansas without depicting the characters as stupid. This film paints a false picture of not just ignorance, but of stupididy on the part of the hillbillys.

    While others seemed quite surprised at Varney's dramatic performance as Jed as being excellent(most associate him with lovable Ernest P. Worrell), I was not surprised. I love the Ernest character and the entire Ernest genre. With Varney being able to pull off a multitude of characters and voices(over 61), I wasn't shocked at his performance as the serious Jed Clampett. It was refreshing to see him play the straight role while the comedy was happening around him. I've always wanted to see Varney in dramatic roles as well and knew he had it in him to do so. Varney was the perfect choice for Jed and no one could've done better. Ebsen should be proud. I must admit, I was so used to seeing Varney as Ernest that I WAS shocked when I saw 'Jed' come down the stairs in a black hat, white shirt and black pants. The first thing I thought was, "Weeeee, Doggie. Sexy." I couldn't help myself. I'm from Alabama, and I know that the accents were somewhat forced on some parts like Elly Mae's but Varney's was dead on. Since he was born in Kentucky and lived in Tennessee, how could it not? With Tomlin, Parton and Coleman, it felt like a 9-5 reunion. Bader playing the moronic Jethro cracked me up especially when he 'figured' out how to bowl. Leachman as Granny was perfect. Being such a small little thing, she has a big personality. I remember watching her as the witch in 'Hansel and Gretal' and just loving the performance. Another hilarious scene was how the Clampett's gave everyone on the interstate the bird because they honestly thought that was how people said hello in 'Californy'. One of my favorite parts was when two hooligans come up beside them after being cut off by Jethro, and pull a gun. Jed stands up, points a huge rifle at them and says, "That's real nice, son. This here's what I carry." The two guys speed away. I grew up watching some of the reruns of the original 'Beverly Hillbillies'. And the movie is a nice parody of the original, but keeping true to the story and characters. Jim sang a version of 'Hot Rod Lincoln' and it was just excellent. Not only did he had a wonderful singing voice, he was also very articulate. I recommend this movie. If you're a Varney fan then I highly recommend you get this and enjoy!!

    Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie Everybody did an awesome job, and was a great tribute to the classic series! When Jed Clampett is hunting, he accidentally finds oil, and is given 2 billion dollars. He takes Elly May, Granny, and Jethro to Bevery Hills to live the sweet life. When arriving at their mansion, Miss Hathaway thinks they are criminals, because of the way they dress. After everything is sorted out, Jed wants to get married. He falls in love with a beautiful con artist named Laura Jackson, who is only after his money. Soon, it's up to Granny and Miss Hathaway to stop the wedding. I highly recommend THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES!!! Yall come back now, ya hear?

    While this movie is not NEARLY as good as the classic TV series, I thought it was very well made. And I thought the cast (with the exception of Jethro and Miss Jane Hatheway) did a mighty fine job of recreating the characters. Jedediah (Jed) Clampett 7/10 I of course liked Buddy Ebsen better, but Jim Varney does a good job of playing this billionaire hillbilly. Daisy (Granny) Moses 9/10 Before I watched this movie, I thought to myself "Nobody can replace Irene Ryan". I was right. Sort of. Cloris Leachman did a very, VERY good job. If not for Ryan before her, she would have been perfect. But, as perfect as she was, Irene Ryan was not just a perfect Granny, she WAS Granny Clampett. Jethro Bodine 3/10 Max Baer Junior was better. Way better. The replacement was too corny, and stupid. (Baer was corny and stupid too, but in a funnier way. Not in this new...Jim Carrey way.) Elly May Clampett 12/10 ;) Believe it or not, I actually liked the replacement better. Donna Douglas exaggerated the role a little too much for me. And the new Elly had a more rugged look to her. Whereas Douglas looked too much like a beauty pageant contestant, and not someone who had spent their life "rassling" with the "critters". Pearl Bodine 8/10 She was in it very little, but she did a good job. Again, it would have been a great job if not for the original.(names fail me. lol) Milburn Drysdale 6/10 Not bad, but the replacement was a little old. Miss Jane Hatheway 2/10 Yikes! I did not like her at ALL! She tried to hard to act like Nancy Kulp, refusing to recognize the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to act like Nancy Kulp! She exaggerated the role WAYYYY to much! (so did Kulp, but with her it came out funny, and it fit her character. With the replacement, it came out...exaggerated!) Storyline 6/10 The plot is similar to the plots of the original episodes: Jed wants to get "hitched" so he can have a wife that will raise the rambunctious tomboy Elly to be "proper", Elly likes to "rassle", swim in the cement pond with her critters, and climb trees, Jethro tries to be a "Hollywood bachelor", Drysdale, aided by his *faithful* secretary, struggle to keep the Clampett account safe in the Commerce bank, and con-men of all sorts try every means possible to swindle money out of the Clampetts, all the while being unknowingly foiled by the Clueless, Trusting Clampetts. The only drawback is that the misadventures tend to be more on the PG side rather than the Family-Friendly TV series of the 60's/70's. (okay, a LOT more) All-in-all, I give it seven stars out of ten stars, and I recommend it as a must-see for any Beverly Hillbillies fanatic! I mean, fan.

    After watching The Beverly Hillbillies Movie and being a big fan of Jim Varney I fell completely in love with this movie! One of my favorites! In the movie Jed Clampett(Jim Varney) becomes a millionaire and moves his family, daughter Ellie May(Erika Eleniak) mother-in-law Granny(Cloris Leachman) and nephew Jethro to Beverly Hills and he's looking to get hitched and falls in lobe with this woman(Lea Thompson) hoping that she'd be perfect to raise his daughter not knowing that she and her partner(Rob Schneider) in of his great character roles are planning to steal his money! Filled with hilarious scenes including the scene where the guy in the jeep say Hey! Nick wheels Buddy! and flicks the Clampetts off and Jed asks Jethro why do you suppose that fellers pointing at us? And Jethro answers Reckon that's how they say howdy in Californie! And then later they do it to Mr. Drysdale(Dabney Coleman) not knowing who he is! That was really hilarious! I just jumped out of my seat laughing! I also liked the scene when Dolly Parton shows up to sing Jed Happy Birthday and Jed(Jim Varmey) smiles with delight! It was just wonderful! Filled with hilarious scenes, bloopers, great story, and wonderful actors and actresses Beverly Hillbillies is one of the greatest movies ever! I will always Charisse the memories of one of the greatest actors in this movie Jim Varney! God bless you Jim Varney 1949-2000! 10 out of 10!

    Oh no, not again! Yes it's yet another classic t.v. favourite forcing itself upon us on the big screen. This time it's the good ole"Beverly Hillbillies" who have made what I call without hesitation the 'dreaded transition'. The new cast, led by Jim Varney (Jed), Diedrich Bader (Jethro), Erica Eleniak (Elly May) and Cloris Leachman (Granny), with support from Dabney Coleman, Lily Tomlin, Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider, all manage to resurrect the familiar faces of the Clampett clan, but apart from that they do little. And as for the plot, which is damn near awful, it seems to have borrowed rather form "The Addams Family" and "Addams Family Values", with its story of deceitful persons attempting to get their hands on the Clampett fortune. All amounts to an incredibly corny, unfunny show that's as flat as a pancake. (How does it take four writers to come up with this drivel? Perhaps less is more?). Funniest moment occurs during the closing credits which feature some of the film's bloopers. Guest starred Dolly Parton, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Buddy Ebsen. Saturday, October 19, 1996 - T.V.

    I didn't watch this movie until a few years after it came out. I was just thinking to myself "Oh, no!!, another remake." It just didn't seem to catch my eye. One night, out of sheer boredom I watched it. To my surprise, I was entertained by this movie. I was amazed by the perfect casting involved, everyone was perfect! The subplot was a little weak, but held true to the series, everyone always trying to get at Jeb's fortune. Overall I found it entertaining and funny. If you go in without expecting too much, just hoping for some lighter fare, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Just picture each character with the new cast; its perfect!!!

    This film based on successful TV series by Paul Henning. It begins when mountaineer Jed accidentally discovers a surprise in his property because he has struck oil during a shooting, gotten million of dollars, and turning instantly billionaire . Then he packs his backwoods family and heads to Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.They change into a lush mansion , but still live like Hillbillies because they still dress tattered ragged suits and rustics costumes .The hillbillies clan are Jed(Jim Varney in the role of Buddy Ebsen), a good-hearted and kind father looking new spouse, his daughter Elly May(Erika Elinak, role of Donna Douglas),an extraordinary gorgeous but incredibly ingenious and pursued by a suitor(Kevin Connolly), the Granny(Cloris Leachman), a senile, paranoid and obstinate old woman and Jethro(Dietrich Vader, role of Max Baer) , he's idiot though strong, he's actually only acting like an authentic stupid and doesn't even realize it. Besides, the ambitious banker(Dabney Coleman) and his botcher helper(Lily Tomlin) who will make anything of keep the Camplett family money in his bank. Meanwhile, they are duped by a mean pair(Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider). Everyone casting does rightly their impersonations from television characters with special mention of Jim Varney as the sensible and good father looking for wife and particularly, Dietrich as a double role as the dumb Jethro and his sister, furthermore a likable Granny, well incarnated by Cloris Leachman. Appear special cameos, Zsa Zsa Gabor as a delinquent, Dolly Parton singing country music and Buddy Ebsen, the original Jed , reprises another of his television acting, Barnaby Jones.The film contains a stunning music score with ballads by Scoggins like the original series, songs by Dolly Parton and Hank Williams and soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin. The motion picture is regularly directed by Penelope Scpheeris. Rating: Average but amusing. The film will like to nostalgics and hardcore series fans.

    Hollywood has produced uncountable numbers of remakes of old TV shows from the 1960's and 70's. I can't even begin to count them or make a list. I've seen some of them. A few have worked; most have been dreadful. This 1993 movie based on the 60's series of the same name falls somewhere in between those two categories, probably leaning a bit toward the dreadful side, but not dreadful in and of itself. The basic plot follows the TV story. Hillbilly Jed Clampett (played here by Jim Varney) strikes it rich one day when he was "shootin' at some food, and up from the ground come a-bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Black gold. Texas tea." (Couldn't resist!) Suddenly rich after he's paid $1 billion for his land, his family tells him that "Californy is the place you ought to be, so they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly. Hills that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars." (Couldn't resist again!) So, once more Jed, Granny (Cloris Leachman), Ellie May (Erike Eleniak) and cousin Jethro (Diedrich Bader) are left to the task of settling into their new life with the help of Mr. Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) and Miss Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) and along for the ride we get a couple of villains played by Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson, who set out to get Jed's money for themselves. This lacked the fun of the TV series. There were parts of it that were amusing. The Clampetts driving along the highway thinking that the middle finger was a California greeting springs to mind, for example. Overall, though, it really wasn't that funny. The cast was so-so. Varney and Leachman were all right. Eleniak, to me, didn't really capture Ellie May's sweet innocence, and Bader as Jethro didn't work for me. Jethro in the TV series was a dumb character, yes, but Bader's Jethro was both too dumb and too underplayed. Bader seemed to think he just had to look and sound stupid and that would be enough. He missed the mark completely. I don't think the Beverly Hillbillies work that well as a movie, either. As a TV series it was fine. You got it in half hour chunks (less counting commercials) and that was enough. Trying to keep it going for over an hour and a half without a break became tiresome after a while. Dolly Parton was included as herself as, I guess, an entertainer the Clampetts (with their country background) would be familiar with. Aside from being recognizable, though, that didn't really do much for me, since I'm not a big Dolly fan. One appearance that did work, though, was from Buddy Ebsen. He, of course, was the original Jed Clampett on the TV series. It was a rather ingenious thought to bring him back for this movie, this time as the other well known character he played on television - private detective Barnaby Jones from the 1970's, whom Miss Hathaway hires to investigate the plot to get Jed's money. When the Barnaby Jones theme started to play I smiled, because right away I knew what (and who) was coming. Ebsen played it perfectly straight, when everyone else often seemed to be trying too hard for laughs. As a result, he was perfect. It's not the worst remake of a TV series. Not by far actually. But it can't honestly be called good either, and with the TV series being just perfect at a half hour per episode, this started to get tired even before the one hour mark had hit. There just isn't really enough meat to the Clampetts to make a movie about them. (5/10)

I just jumped out of my seat laughing! I also liked the scene when Dolly Parton shows up to sing Jed Happy Birthday and Jed(Jim Varmey) smiles with delight! It was just wonderful! Filled with hilarious scenes, bloopers, great story, and wonderful actors and actresses Beverly Hillbillies is one of the greatest movies ever! I will always Charisse the memories of one of the greatest actors in this movie Jim Varney! God bless you Jim Varney 1949-2000! 10 out of 10!

    Oh no, not again! Yes it's yet another classic t.v. favourite forcing itself upon us on the big screen. This time it's the good ole"Beverly Hillbillies" who have made what I call without hesitation the 'dreaded transition'. The new cast, led by Jim Varney (Jed), Diedrich Bader (Jethro), Erica Eleniak (Elly May) and Cloris Leachman (Granny), with support from Dabney Coleman, Lily Tomlin, Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider, all manage to resurrect the familiar faces of the Clampett clan, but apart from that they do little. And as for the plot, which is damn near awful, it seems to have borrowed rather form "The Addams Family" and "Addams Family Values", with its story of deceitful persons attempting to get their hands on the Clampett fortune. All amounts to an incredibly corny, unfunny show that's as flat as a pancake. (How does it take four writers to come up with this drivel? Perhaps less is more?). Funniest moment occurs during the closing credits which feature some of the film's bloopers. Guest starred Dolly Parton, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Buddy Ebsen. Saturday, October 19, 1996 - T.V.

    I didn't watch this movie until a few years after it came out. I was just thinking to myself "Oh, no!!, another remake." It just didn't seem to catch my eye. One night, out of sheer boredom I watched it. To my surprise, I was entertained by this movie. I was amazed by the perfect casting involved, everyone was perfect! The subplot was a little weak, but held true to the series, everyone always trying to get at Jeb's fortune. Overall I found it entertaining and funny. If you go in without expecting too much, just hoping for some lighter fare, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Just picture each character with the new cast; its perfect!!!

    Hollywood has produced uncountable numbers of remakes of old TV shows from the 1960's and 70's. I can't even begin to count them or make a list. I've seen some of them. A few have worked; most have been dreadful. This 1993 movie based on the 60's series of the same name falls somewhere in between those two categories, probably leaning a bit toward the dreadful side, but not dreadful in and of itself. The basic plot follows the TV story. Hillbilly Jed Clampett (played here by Jim Varney) strikes it rich one day when he was "shootin' at some food, and up from the ground come a-bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Black gold. Texas tea." (Couldn't resist!) Suddenly rich after he's paid $1 billion for his land, his family tells him that "Californy is the place you ought to be, so they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly. Hills that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars." (Couldn't resist again!) So, once more Jed, Granny (Cloris Leachman), Ellie May (Erike Eleniak) and cousin Jethro (Diedrich Bader) are left to the task of settling into their new life with the help of Mr. Drysdale (Dabney Coleman) and Miss Hathaway (Lily Tomlin) and along for the ride we get a couple of villains played by Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson, who set out to get Jed's money for themselves. This lacked the fun of the TV series. There were parts of it that were amusing. The Clampetts driving along the highway thinking that the middle finger was a California greeting springs to mind, for example. Overall, though, it really wasn't that funny. The cast was so-so. Varney and Leachman were all right. Eleniak, to me, didn't really capture Ellie May's sweet innocence, and Bader as Jethro didn't work for me. Jethro in the TV series was a dumb character, yes, but Bader's Jethro was both too dumb and too underplayed. Bader seemed to think he just had to look and sound stupid and that would be enough. He missed the mark completely. I don't think the Beverly Hillbillies work that well as a movie, either. As a TV series it was fine. You got it in half hour chunks (less counting commercials) and that was enough. Trying to keep it going for over an hour and a half without a break became tiresome after a while. Dolly Parton was included as herself as, I guess, an entertainer the Clampetts (with their country background) would be familiar with. Aside from being recognizable, though, that didn't really do much for me, since I'm not a big Dolly fan. One appearance that did work, though, was from Buddy Ebsen. He, of course, was the original Jed Clampett on the TV series. It was a rather ingenious thought to bring him back for this movie, this time as the other well known character he played on television - private detective Barnaby Jones from the 1970's, whom Miss Hathaway hires to investigate the plot to get Jed's money. When the Barnaby Jones theme started to play I smiled, because right away I knew what (and who) was coming. Ebsen played it perfectly straight, when everyone else often seemed to be trying too hard for laughs. As a result, he was perfect. It's not the worst remake of a TV series. Not by far actually. But it can't honestly be called good either, and with the TV series being just perfect at a half hour per episode, this started to get tired even before the one hour mark had hit. There just isn't really enough meat to the Clampetts to make a movie about them. (5/10)

    It's become a clich&eacute; that modern adaptations of classic TV shows are among the worst movies of all. "The Flintstones" was simply a BAD movie in every way! While there have been a few bright spots ("The Addams Family" and "Charlie's Angels") pretty much everything else has been execrable. This modern adaptation of the Clampett brood has some funny stuff but mostly isn't worth the time. One could make the argument that "The Beverly Hillbillies" is half-homage, half-parody. Even so, this was a letdown for Penelope Spheeris after "Wayne's World". It was interesting to see Jim Varney in a non-Ernest role, though. Also starring Cloris Leachman, Erika Eleniak (the girl kissed by Elliott in "ET"), Lily Tomlin, Dabney Coleman and Rob Schneider.

    This was a big disappointment because I expected more of the series. The roles of Jethro, the banker and prospective bride were awful. The roles of father and daughter were well written and well performed. Tomlinson also did a great job. But the writing for the other characters was awful and the acting was either awful or possibly well performed to an awful script. The main objection I have to the film is that it is demeaning to hillbillys. The original series was entertaining in pointing out the difference between Hollywood and Arkansas without depicting the characters as stupid. This film paints a false picture of not just ignorance, but of stupididy on the part of the hillbillys.

    While others seemed quite surprised at Varney's dramatic performance as Jed as being excellent(most associate him with lovable Ernest P. Worrell), I was not surprised. I love the Ernest character and the entire Ernest genre. With Varney being able to pull off a multitude of characters and voices(over 61), I wasn't shocked at his performance as the serious Jed Clampett. It was refreshing to see him play the straight role while the comedy was happening around him. I've always wanted to see Varney in dramatic roles as well and knew he had it in him to do so. Varney was the perfect choice for Jed and no one could've done better. Ebsen should be proud. I must admit, I was so used to seeing Varney as Ernest that I WAS shocked when I saw 'Jed' come down the stairs in a black hat, white shirt and black pants. The first thing I thought was, "Weeeee, Doggie. Sexy." I couldn't help myself. I'm from Alabama, and I know that the accents were somewhat forced on some parts like Elly Mae's but Varney's was dead on. Since he was born in Kentucky and lived in Tennessee, how could it not? With Tomlin, Parton and Coleman, it felt like a 9-5 reunion. Bader playing the moronic Jethro cracked me up especially when he 'figured' out how to bowl. Leachman as Granny was perfect. Being such a small little thing, she has a big personality. I remember watching her as the witch in 'Hansel and Gretal' and just loving the performance. Another hilarious scene was how the Clampett's gave everyone on the interstate the bird because they honestly thought that was how people said hello in 'Californy'. One of my favorite parts was when two hooligans come up beside them after being cut off by Jethro, and pull a gun. Jed stands up, points a huge rifle at them and says, "That's real nice, son. This here's what I carry." The two guys speed away. I grew up watching some of the reruns of the original 'Beverly Hillbillies'. And the movie is a nice parody of the original, but keeping true to the story and characters. Jim sang a version of 'Hot Rod Lincoln' and it was just excellent. Not only did he had a wonderful singing voice, he was also very articulate. I recommend this movie. If you're a Varney fan then I highly recommend you get this and enjoy!!

    Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie Everybody did an awesome job, and was a great tribute to the classic series! When Jed Clampett is hunting, he accidentally finds oil, and is given 2 billion dollars. He takes Elly May, Granny, and Jethro to Bevery Hills to live the sweet life. When arriving at their mansion, Miss Hathaway thinks they are criminals, because of the way they dress. After everything is sorted out, Jed wants to get married. He falls in love with a beautiful con artist named Laura Jackson, who is only after his money. Soon, it's up to Granny and Miss Hathaway to stop the wedding. I highly recommend THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES!!! Yall come back now, ya hear?

    While this movie is not NEARLY as good as the classic TV series, I thought it was very well made. And I thought the cast (with the exception of Jethro and Miss Jane Hatheway) did a mighty fine job of recreating the characters. Jedediah (Jed) Clampett 7/10 I of course liked Buddy Ebsen better, but Jim Varney does a good job of playing this billionaire hillbilly. Daisy (Granny) Moses 9/10 Before I watched this movie, I thought to myself "Nobody can replace Irene Ryan". I was right. Sort of. Cloris Leachman did a very, VERY good job. If not for Ryan before her, she would have been perfect. But, as perfect as she was, Irene Ryan was not just a perfect Granny, she WAS Granny Clampett. Jethro Bodine 3/10 Max Baer Junior was better. Way better. The replacement was too corny, and stupid. (Baer was corny and stupid too, but in a funnier way. Not in this new...Jim Carrey way.) Elly May Clampett 12/10 ;) Believe it or not, I actually liked the replacement better. Donna Douglas exaggerated the role a little too much for me. And the new Elly had a more rugged look to her. Whereas Douglas looked too much like a beauty pageant contestant, and not someone who had spent their life "rassling" with the "critters". Pearl Bodine 8/10 She was in it very little, but she did a good job. Again, it would have been a great job if not for the original.(names fail me. lol) Milburn Drysdale 6/10 Not bad, but the replacement was a little old. Miss Jane Hatheway 2/10 Yikes! I did not like her at ALL! She tried to hard to act like Nancy Kulp, refusing to recognize the fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE to act like Nancy Kulp! She exaggerated the role WAYYYY to much! (so did Kulp, but with her it came out funny, and it fit her character. With the replacement, it came out...exaggerated!) Storyline 6/10 The plot is similar to the plots of the original episodes: Jed wants to get "hitched" so he can have a wife that will raise the rambunctious tomboy Elly to be "proper", Elly likes to "rassle", swim in the cement pond with her critters, and climb trees, Jethro tries to be a "Hollywood bachelor", Drysdale, aided by his *faithful* secretary, struggle to keep the Clampett account safe in the Commerce bank, and con-men of all sorts try every means possible to swindle money out of the Clampetts, all the while being unknowingly foiled by the Clueless, Trusting Clampetts. The only drawback is that the misadventures tend to be more on the PG side rather than the Family-Friendly TV series of the 60's/70's. (okay, a LOT more) All-in-all, I give it seven stars out of ten stars, and I recommend it as a must-see for any Beverly Hillbillies fanatic! I mean, fan.

    After watching The Beverly Hillbillies Movie and being a big fan of Jim Varney I fell completely in love with this movie! One of my favorites! In the movie Jed Clampett(Jim Varney) becomes a millionaire and moves his family, daughter Ellie May(Erika Eleniak) mother-in-law Granny(Cloris Leachman) and nephew Jethro to Beverly Hills and he's looking to get hitched and falls in lobe with this woman(Lea Thompson) hoping that she'd be perfect to raise his daughter not knowing that she and her partner(Rob Schneider) in of his great character roles are planning to steal his money! Filled with hilarious scenes including the scene where the guy in the jeep say Hey! Nick wheels Buddy! and flicks the Clampetts off and Jed asks Jethro why do you suppose that fellers pointing at us? And Jethro answers Reckon that's how they say howdy in Californie! And then later they do it to Mr. Drysdale(Dabney Coleman) not knowing who he is! That was really hilarious! I just jumped out of my seat laughing! I also liked the scene when Dolly Parton shows up to sing Jed Happy Birthday and Jed(Jim Varmey) smiles with delight! It was just wonderful! Filled with hilarious scenes, bloopers, great story, and wonderful actors and actresses Beverly Hillbillies is one of the greatest movies ever! I will always Charisse the memories of one of the greatest actors in this movie Jim Varney! God bless you Jim Varney 1949-2000! 10 out of 10!

    Oh no, not again! Yes it's yet another classic t.v. favourite forcing itself upon us on the big screen. This time it's the good ole"Beverly Hillbillies" who have made what I call without hesitation the 'dreaded transition'.
