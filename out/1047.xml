    Doug is having a hard time getting everything done. He is being pressured to do more at the construction business he works for, as well as by his wife Laura who wants him to spend time with children Zack and Jennifer. Laura wants to return to her career, as a woman she started out with has been promoted and wants Laura to replace her. But he may have the solution: one of the residents of a development he is supervising has perfected cloning. In fact, it was his clone who signed a deal with Doug's company. So Doug decides to go for it. A second Doug is created, with all his memories. Problem solved! He just has to hide the second Doug in the guest house. The second Doug will go to work while original Doug spends time with the family and takes time for himself--playing golf, for example. You know where this is going. One clone can't do it all. So another one is needed. And possibly another. And each one creates its own kind of chaos. For example, one Doug can make Laura happy (no, not that way, although ...) at home better than original Doug can. And, unfortunately, it's not all funny. That's fine, because there are lessons to be learned and the lead actors are so good I'm willing to see them do anything. Michael Keaton does a very good job playing four distinct characters: Steve (original Doug), Lance (the first clone, a macho pig), Rico (the sensitive and effeminate second clone), and Lenny (because he is a copy of a copy, he is "special"). Andie MacDowell is very funny in a series of scenes that begins with her in a sexy nightie and ends with her in just a pajama top. When more than one Doug is on screen, it really looks as if both or all are there. I wasn't distracted by trying to figure out how they did it. I have a small TV, though. It's a hilarious and rewarding effort.

    O.K. It's not Keaton's best, but it's by Harold Ramis and his films are always fun and unique. A man has himself cloned to simplify his life and, of course, it becomes quite a mess. It sort of plays like a sequel to "Mr. Mom", as Michael (or his clone) eventually ends up playing a "Mr. Mom" so his wife can return to work, this time, as a "Realtor". Michael does a great job portraying 4 different personalities, including a macho-man, a metro-sexual, a "goofy" copy, and himself, Doug One. The funniest scene in the movie involves Laura's rampant sexuality, right after Doug warns all the clones "not to sleep with my wife". Andie Mcdowell, as Laura, is quite good as his long-suffering wife, but she isn't Terri Garr, so she pretty much plays the "straight-man" to Doug and 3 clones. Many plot-holes, as it is quite unbelievable that absolutely no one would notice "triplets" living in the guest room over the garage. Great special effects. It looks real, not matted in. Like Mr. Mom, the film starts to lose its luster and drags towards the end, but wraps up smartly with Laura looking out the car window and, not believing her eyes, sees all 3 clones drive by on their "road trip" South. The cloning process looks about as real as any sci-fi "techno-babel" ever seen on "Star Trek". I just saw this on "This TV" and have yet to see it uncut. It's a 117 minute film and they ran it in 120 minutes with many commercials. Besides speeding up the film, what did they cut out to fit the time slot? Lots of fun, and it's worth at least one viewing. More if you like Michael Keaton at his funniest. And always remember this: "When you make a copy of a copy it's never as sharp as the original!"

    From the director of "Groundhog Day", "Multiplictity" starring Michael Keaton and Andie MacDowell is somewhat underrated in the sense that it's rarely ever heard of nowadays and it was bashed by many critics upon it's release. I've watched it twice now, and I can tell you that it's a very entertaining movie and is quirky, goofy and inane in it's portrayal of what would happen if a man were to clone himself. It's original in it's concept, the story being based on a short story by a man named Chris Miller. Michael Keaton is Doug Kinney, a Los Angeles construction worker who finds that home is just a place he goes to in between chaotic situations at work; one of his employees (Played by Eugene Levy) for example has just gone and dug up the wrong driveway in suburbia. His hectic situation has his stay-at-home wife Laura (Andie Macdowel) frustrated as she would like to get back to work, and not have to take care of their two young children all day. In a fit of rage one day, Doug, who is frustrated as he finds that his work comes first, then his family, and then time for himself tagging along in third place, attracts the attention of a scientist who believes that he may have a solution to Doug's problems; cloning. So Doug agrees to the procedure, and an exact copy of him is created. However, physically the clone is an exact copy, but their personalities will differ in certain ways, as this clone is more macho and hard working than Doug. So Doug lets his wife go back to work, while he fills in at home, and the clone works at the construction sites. However, it isn't long before Doug clones himself again, and a more camp, sensitive and domesticated version of him is produced. The clones are made live in the garage, and eventually, they clone themselves, producing a degenerate form of Doug (Something to do with clone genes being bad). It's predictable from here on in, but it's very entertaining as the clones and Doug attempt to elude Laura's suspicions that her Doug hasn't been the same man lately. The special effects are superb in this film as they allow Michael Keaton to portray three to four different characters on the screen at the one time. Keaton provides a brilliant performance, displaying a wide range of acting skills as he portrays completely different personalities of the same character. It's an interesting concept - this cloning thing - and while the screenplay could have had had the clones doing crazier things or getting into more trouble, increasing the possibility of detection, then this could have been a completely different movie. Whether it would have been better of not, I'm not sure, but as it is, "Multiplicity" is a fun movie that I really enjoyed more upon a second viewing and really made me laugh.

    Ever since the box office success of "Groundhog Day", director Harold Ramis has never looked better and even went further when he paired Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in the 1999 classic "Analyze This". In his early film career, he started out at mid-range, even as an actor (though he was excellent in "Ghostbusters"). Before then Ramis depended on getting approval with his audience with slapstick comedies to please the Hollywood masses. "Caddyshack" sort of stood out above the rest, but it was still an overrated film considering the more fresher work he's done later in his career. "Multiplicity" stars Michael Keaton as a construction foreman named Doug Kinney who feels overloaded in his work with very little appreciation from the people surrounding him. Feeling like he's at the end of his rope, he conjures up a crazy solution. By irony, while he is supervising a facility that specializes in cloning techniques, he decides that this might actually work out the kinks of multi-tasking work and family life. Once the doctor gives him the green light to start cloning, a duplicate emerges. However, the clones were not as equal in intelligence as Doug had hoped for. So he kept making more duplicates of himself and now, Doug finds himself in a more deeper predicament than he was before. The comical notion emerges on how Doug is going to fix the messes he got himself.in. Within each clone, they eventually start to pick up on his mental characteristics and it in a way exhibits our ways of the trials and tribulations in dealing with work and family life and we realize that there will never be any shortcuts and that we must take everything one day at a time. Many reviews put this movie down because it mainly lacks in anything remotely logical. I have no reason to argue about that analogy at all. But you have to understand that this is just a comedy that doesn't have to be plausible in any way. But the overall concept of this comedy has a very deep effect about life itself and the subtle dramatic undertones does indeed garner much for the audience to think about when you're in a similar situation that Doug is facing in his life. However, Keaton's silly humor will likely keep you entertained at the same time. And this is where we see the improvements that Ramis has accomplished as a director and writer. He doesn't have to depend on having lazy jerks screwing with every woman they lay eyes on, or people doing disgusting bodily functions like farting and burping just get the viewers attention. And though there is very little in terms of content. Your kids won't have to worry about stuff like nudity or gratuitous course language. If there were changes made, it wouldn't be for the better. It might come come off as too goofy or too dramatic or maybe even a little bit of both. Sometimes things are left best just the way it is, and "Multiplicity" is one of those movies.

    Michael Keaton can never be doubted. Here's an actor who's done great work throughout his career. Right from the 1980's to the 1990's & to the 2000's, Keaton's range & confidence as a performer has only raised above. And 'Multiplicity' very correctly reaffirms that fact right. 'Multiplicity' Synopsis: A man who never has enough time for the things he wants to do is offered the opportunity to have himself duplicated. 'Multiplicity' is an entertaining film. It runs smoothly & culminates way before it could have doomed. The interesting concept, gets it's due, as it's transferred on-screen efficiently. Harold Ramis's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Keaton's performance is truly fantastic in here. He plays 4 characters with great variety & confidence. He is the backbone of this film. Among other performances, Andie MacDowell does well, while Eugene Levy & Harris Yulin lend support. On the whole, If You're A Keaton Fan, well then 'Multiplicity' is your best bet.

    This is not the best comedy ever made, but in all fairness I have to say that I've sat through more than a few comedies and never even cracked a smile. This one on a handful of occasions actually had me laughing out loud, so for that reason alone I have to say it's pretty solid. Michael Keaton is what makes this work so well. It's not just because he's the star - it's that he stars in four roles. It's not a costume comedy, though, which makes his performance all the better. He essentially plays the same character with tweaks and variations to differentiate between them, and he pulls it off brilliantly. Each character is a character of his own, and even the interactions between the characters he plays are pulled off flawlessly so that everything is very natural. The story is tailor made for a comedy revolving around mistaken identity. Keaton's basic character is Doug Kinney, an overworked contractor who's finding that he doesn't have time to keep everything in his life in balance. Hoping for a miracle to help keep his life together he finds himself doing some work for a geneticist who's discovered the secret of "cloning" humans. It's not scientific - the "clones" come out as exact physical replicas rather than as newborn babies with identical genetic material to the original - but this is a comedy, so who cares! It works! Starting with one clone (named, simply, "2") Doug finds that even one copy isn't enough, so he makes another (named, appropriately, "3.") 2 and 3 are completely different from Doug and polar opposites from each other. 2 is a macho, take charge type who happily takes over the contracting business but chafes about having to stay out of sight when he'd much rather be picking up women, while 3 is an effeminate, stay at home type who loves cooking and cleaning. Eventually, 2 and 3 find themselves over-burdened, and they create another clone (named - guess what - "4.") except that 4 is a copy of copy and so, therefore, imperfect, for lack of a better way to put it. Intended to make Doug's life easier, all these 3 clones do is introduce increasing chaos, and at times it is hilarious. Really the only other cast member of note is Andie MacDowell (who teams again with director Harold Ramis as she did in "Groundhog Day") as Doug's increasingly confused wife Laura. Unfortunately, the movie revolves so completely around Doug and the clones that MacDowell, while she was good enough and as always quite lovely, seemed to fade into the background more often than not, so that her talents were generally underused. She's more impressive opposite Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day" than she is here, but that's more a result of the type of movie and the role that it asked of her rather than any deficiency in her performance. This is almost two hours long - which might be a little bit too much for this type of silly comedy. It gets to that length perhaps by trying to introduce too much "drama" (if you will) in the last while about Doug and Laura's faltering marriage. Still, it's a funny movie, and Keaton's performance is worth watching. (7/10)

    A very funny movie. The parts Keaton plays are all different from each other and the movie gets funnier as it goes along unlike other comedies that are played out towards the end. The final clone is a work of art, and how the other "characters" react to it is also hilarious. I watch this movie any time it is on television. There isn't really another movie like it and Keaton's deviation away form harder movies like Pacific Heights shows he's a good actor. There has been a lot of negative reviews here for the film but I can't personally see the problem that a lot of people have with it, it's not meant to be serious and provides great entertainment. Worth a watch.

    This movie is not the best of it's genre, but is definitely a good movie if you are not expecting a great movie.This movie is enjoyable and have some very funny moments.It worth to be seen. Doug Kinney is a man who has many problems.He is very busy with his job and doesn't have much time for his family.In one day at work he meets a man who "saves" him.He is multiplied by this man and now he has much time for his family.His clones replace him at work and now he can stay with his kids, but this is not what he thought to be an easy thing.His clones has the same appearance but different personalities.One is shy, one is serious and one is retarded.It's message is that we all are different.

    One person sells MULTIPLICITY: Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. Keaton is Doug Kinney, so swamped in career and family life that in order to find felicity for himself, he creates a clone to share the burden of domesticity. But one clone turns into two clones turns into three clones the complicity confusing his workmates, his wife (Andie MacDowell), and especially himself. Keaton displays his magnificent multifaceted elasticity by playing every clone with a distinct personality - and never lapses or loses conviction in the four different archetypes. Keaton's performances are so subtle, and work so well against each of himself, that we never notice how stunning his portrayals are; how much blood, sweat and CGI must have gone into learning his lines in a certain character and then playing off three other actors who would eventually be replaced by him - and playing off them four different times as four different types! It is a jaw-dropping performance. Clone Number 1 (whom Doug calls "2") is The Bruce Willis - the masculine side of Doug predominant; "3" is Doug's feminine side predominant; when "2" clones himself to make "4," it's a monkey boy, because "you know how copies of a copy are not as good as the original..." Don't bring analyticity  or it gets disturbing. So the movie never dwells on the cloning process or its moral implications. The only moral authority is Doug's Rule Number One: "No one sleeps with my wife except me!" Of course, one rainy night when Doug "1" is away, that specificity is not simplicity when Doug's wife wants fluidity Keaton is in every single scene, yet because he plays the four personalities so convincingly, when Doug "1" spends so much time offscreen trying to stay on eternal vacation we feel like we're watching three other guys playing Keaton playing Doug! We kick ourselves to remind us it's Keaton on screen IN PERPETUITY. The visual acuity - lighting and sightlines - is 95-percent on target, and as Doug's clones build in their multiplexity, Keaton's synchronicity with his multiplicity is ingenuity incongruity. Directed by Harold Ramis, MULTIPLICITY is bound to be good gratuity from the get-go. Keaton takes it into orbital superfluity. Ably supported by Andie McDowell and her strange accent, reliably confused in all the right places, as is the rest of the cast (Richard Masur, Eugene Levy, Ann Cusack), who feature minimally because Keaton is hogging all the screen time. Message comes through loud and clear - having more of yourself doesn't make life easier, but actually harder; multiplicity breeds instability. There are metaphors on top of metaphors: Doug had to go outside of himself to see himself; in discontinuity, Doug learns continuity; in promiscuity, Doug learns monogamy; in ambiguity, I've lost myself in trying to rhyme everything After "2" clones himself, the real Doug yells without irony, "You can't just go around cloning people!" Doubt anyone else could have pulled off these roles with as much electricity in their authenticity and eccentricity. After all, there's only one Michael Keaton! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    If you are a fan of Michael Keaton, this is a movie you don't want to miss. The plot revolves around Doug Kinney who has a good life but he is always stressed out at work. That is until a doctor confronts him and tells him that he can clone him. He thinks it's a good idea at first. That is until the clone starts interfering in his relationship with his wife. The movie is very funny. You find yourself laughing from beginning to end like I did. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. It's a very funny movie!

So he kept making more duplicates of himself and now, Doug finds himself in a more deeper predicament than he was before. The comical notion emerges on how Doug is going to fix the messes he got himself.in. Within each clone, they eventually start to pick up on his mental characteristics and it in a way exhibits our ways of the trials and tribulations in dealing with work and family life and we realize that there will never be any shortcuts and that we must take everything one day at a time. Many reviews put this movie down because it mainly lacks in anything remotely logical. I have no reason to argue about that analogy at all. But you have to understand that this is just a comedy that doesn't have to be plausible in any way. But the overall concept of this comedy has a very deep effect about life itself and the subtle dramatic undertones does indeed garner much for the audience to think about when you're in a similar situation that Doug is facing in his life. However, Keaton's silly humor will likely keep you entertained at the same time. And this is where we see the improvements that Ramis has accomplished as a director and writer. He doesn't have to depend on having lazy jerks screwing with every woman they lay eyes on, or people doing disgusting bodily functions like farting and burping just get the viewers attention. And though there is very little in terms of content. Your kids won't have to worry about stuff like nudity or gratuitous course language. If there were changes made, it wouldn't be for the better. It might come come off as too goofy or too dramatic or maybe even a little bit of both. Sometimes things are left best just the way it is, and "Multiplicity" is one of those movies.

    Michael Keaton can never be doubted. Here's an actor who's done great work throughout his career. Right from the 1980's to the 1990's & to the 2000's, Keaton's range & confidence as a performer has only raised above. And 'Multiplicity' very correctly reaffirms that fact right. 'Multiplicity' Synopsis: A man who never has enough time for the things he wants to do is offered the opportunity to have himself duplicated. 'Multiplicity' is an entertaining film. It runs smoothly & culminates way before it could have doomed. The interesting concept, gets it's due, as it's transferred on-screen efficiently. Harold Ramis's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Keaton's performance is truly fantastic in here. He plays 4 characters with great variety & confidence. He is the backbone of this film. Among other performances, Andie MacDowell does well, while Eugene Levy & Harris Yulin lend support. On the whole, If You're A Keaton Fan, well then 'Multiplicity' is your best bet.

    This is not the best comedy ever made, but in all fairness I have to say that I've sat through more than a few comedies and never even cracked a smile. This one on a handful of occasions actually had me laughing out loud, so for that reason alone I have to say it's pretty solid. Michael Keaton is what makes this work so well. It's not just because he's the star - it's that he stars in four roles. It's not a costume comedy, though, which makes his performance all the better. He essentially plays the same character with tweaks and variations to differentiate between them, and he pulls it off brilliantly. Each character is a character of his own, and even the interactions between the characters he plays are pulled off flawlessly so that everything is very natural. The story is tailor made for a comedy revolving around mistaken identity. Keaton's basic character is Doug Kinney, an overworked contractor who's finding that he doesn't have time to keep everything in his life in balance. Hoping for a miracle to help keep his life together he finds himself doing some work for a geneticist who's discovered the secret of "cloning" humans. It's not scientific - the "clones" come out as exact physical replicas rather than as newborn babies with identical genetic material to the original - but this is a comedy, so who cares! It works! Starting with one clone (named, simply, "2") Doug finds that even one copy isn't enough, so he makes another (named, appropriately, "3.") 2 and 3 are completely different from Doug and polar opposites from each other. 2 is a macho, take charge type who happily takes over the contracting business but chafes about having to stay out of sight when he'd much rather be picking up women, while 3 is an effeminate, stay at home type who loves cooking and cleaning. Eventually, 2 and 3 find themselves over-burdened, and they create another clone (named - guess what - "4.") except that 4 is a copy of copy and so, therefore, imperfect, for lack of a better way to put it. Intended to make Doug's life easier, all these 3 clones do is introduce increasing chaos, and at times it is hilarious. Really the only other cast member of note is Andie MacDowell (who teams again with director Harold Ramis as she did in "Groundhog Day") as Doug's increasingly confused wife Laura. Unfortunately, the movie revolves so completely around Doug and the clones that MacDowell, while she was good enough and as always quite lovely, seemed to fade into the background more often than not, so that her talents were generally underused. She's more impressive opposite Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day" than she is here, but that's more a result of the type of movie and the role that it asked of her rather than any deficiency in her performance. This is almost two hours long - which might be a little bit too much for this type of silly comedy. It gets to that length perhaps by trying to introduce too much "drama" (if you will) in the last while about Doug and Laura's faltering marriage. Still, it's a funny movie, and Keaton's performance is worth watching. (7/10)

    A very funny movie. The parts Keaton plays are all different from each other and the movie gets funnier as it goes along unlike other comedies that are played out towards the end. The final clone is a work of art, and how the other "characters" react to it is also hilarious. I watch this movie any time it is on television. There isn't really another movie like it and Keaton's deviation away form harder movies like Pacific Heights shows he's a good actor. There has been a lot of negative reviews here for the film but I can't personally see the problem that a lot of people have with it, it's not meant to be serious and provides great entertainment. Worth a watch.

    One person sells MULTIPLICITY: Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. Keaton is Doug Kinney, so swamped in career and family life that in order to find felicity for himself, he creates a clone to share the burden of domesticity. But one clone turns into two clones turns into three clones the complicity confusing his workmates, his wife (Andie MacDowell), and especially himself. Keaton displays his magnificent multifaceted elasticity by playing every clone with a distinct personality - and never lapses or loses conviction in the four different archetypes. Keaton's performances are so subtle, and work so well against each of himself, that we never notice how stunning his portrayals are; how much blood, sweat and CGI must have gone into learning his lines in a certain character and then playing off three other actors who would eventually be replaced by him - and playing off them four different times as four different types! It is a jaw-dropping performance. Clone Number 1 (whom Doug calls "2") is The Bruce Willis - the masculine side of Doug predominant; "3" is Doug's feminine side predominant; when "2" clones himself to make "4," it's a monkey boy, because "you know how copies of a copy are not as good as the original..." Don't bring analyticity  or it gets disturbing. So the movie never dwells on the cloning process or its moral implications. The only moral authority is Doug's Rule Number One: "No one sleeps with my wife except me!" Of course, one rainy night when Doug "1" is away, that specificity is not simplicity when Doug's wife wants fluidity Keaton is in every single scene, yet because he plays the four personalities so convincingly, when Doug "1" spends so much time offscreen trying to stay on eternal vacation we feel like we're watching three other guys playing Keaton playing Doug! We kick ourselves to remind us it's Keaton on screen IN PERPETUITY. The visual acuity - lighting and sightlines - is 95-percent on target, and as Doug's clones build in their multiplexity, Keaton's synchronicity with his multiplicity is ingenuity incongruity. Directed by Harold Ramis, MULTIPLICITY is bound to be good gratuity from the get-go. Keaton takes it into orbital superfluity. Ably supported by Andie McDowell and her strange accent, reliably confused in all the right places, as is the rest of the cast (Richard Masur, Eugene Levy, Ann Cusack), who feature minimally because Keaton is hogging all the screen time. Message comes through loud and clear - having more of yourself doesn't make life easier, but actually harder; multiplicity breeds instability. There are metaphors on top of metaphors: Doug had to go outside of himself to see himself; in discontinuity, Doug learns continuity; in promiscuity, Doug learns monogamy; in ambiguity, I've lost myself in trying to rhyme everything After "2" clones himself, the real Doug yells without irony, "You can't just go around cloning people!" Doubt anyone else could have pulled off these roles with as much electricity in their authenticity and eccentricity. After all, there's only one Michael Keaton! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    If you are a fan of Michael Keaton, this is a movie you don't want to miss. The plot revolves around Doug Kinney who has a good life but he is always stressed out at work. That is until a doctor confronts him and tells him that he can clone him. He thinks it's a good idea at first. That is until the clone starts interfering in his relationship with his wife. The movie is very funny. You find yourself laughing from beginning to end like I did. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. It's a very funny movie!

    Doug is having a hard time getting everything done. He is being pressured to do more at the construction business he works for, as well as by his wife Laura who wants him to spend time with children Zack and Jennifer. Laura wants to return to her career, as a woman she started out with has been promoted and wants Laura to replace her. But he may have the solution: one of the residents of a development he is supervising has perfected cloning. In fact, it was his clone who signed a deal with Doug's company. So Doug decides to go for it. A second Doug is created, with all his memories. Problem solved! He just has to hide the second Doug in the guest house. The second Doug will go to work while original Doug spends time with the family and takes time for himself--playing golf, for example. You know where this is going. One clone can't do it all. So another one is needed. And possibly another. And each one creates its own kind of chaos. For example, one Doug can make Laura happy (no, not that way, although ...) at home better than original Doug can. And, unfortunately, it's not all funny. That's fine, because there are lessons to be learned and the lead actors are so good I'm willing to see them do anything. Michael Keaton does a very good job playing four distinct characters: Steve (original Doug), Lance (the first clone, a macho pig), Rico (the sensitive and effeminate second clone), and Lenny (because he is a copy of a copy, he is "special"). Andie MacDowell is very funny in a series of scenes that begins with her in a sexy nightie and ends with her in just a pajama top. When more than one Doug is on screen, it really looks as if both or all are there. I wasn't distracted by trying to figure out how they did it. I have a small TV, though. It's a hilarious and rewarding effort.

    O.K. It's not Keaton's best, but it's by Harold Ramis and his films are always fun and unique. A man has himself cloned to simplify his life and, of course, it becomes quite a mess. It sort of plays like a sequel to "Mr. Mom", as Michael (or his clone) eventually ends up playing a "Mr. Mom" so his wife can return to work, this time, as a "Realtor". Michael does a great job portraying 4 different personalities, including a macho-man, a metro-sexual, a "goofy" copy, and himself, Doug One. The funniest scene in the movie involves Laura's rampant sexuality, right after Doug warns all the clones "not to sleep with my wife". Andie Mcdowell, as Laura, is quite good as his long-suffering wife, but she isn't Terri Garr, so she pretty much plays the "straight-man" to Doug and 3 clones. Many plot-holes, as it is quite unbelievable that absolutely no one would notice "triplets" living in the guest room over the garage. Great special effects. It looks real, not matted in. Like Mr. Mom, the film starts to lose its luster and drags towards the end, but wraps up smartly with Laura looking out the car window and, not believing her eyes, sees all 3 clones drive by on their "road trip" South. The cloning process looks about as real as any sci-fi "techno-babel" ever seen on "Star Trek". I just saw this on "This TV" and have yet to see it uncut. It's a 117 minute film and they ran it in 120 minutes with many commercials. Besides speeding up the film, what did they cut out to fit the time slot? Lots of fun, and it's worth at least one viewing. More if you like Michael Keaton at his funniest. And always remember this: "When you make a copy of a copy it's never as sharp as the original!"

    From the director of "Groundhog Day", "Multiplictity" starring Michael Keaton and Andie MacDowell is somewhat underrated in the sense that it's rarely ever heard of nowadays and it was bashed by many critics upon it's release. I've watched it twice now, and I can tell you that it's a very entertaining movie and is quirky, goofy and inane in it's portrayal of what would happen if a man were to clone himself. It's original in it's concept, the story being based on a short story by a man named Chris Miller. Michael Keaton is Doug Kinney, a Los Angeles construction worker who finds that home is just a place he goes to in between chaotic situations at work; one of his employees (Played by Eugene Levy) for example has just gone and dug up the wrong driveway in suburbia. His hectic situation has his stay-at-home wife Laura (Andie Macdowel) frustrated as she would like to get back to work, and not have to take care of their two young children all day. In a fit of rage one day, Doug, who is frustrated as he finds that his work comes first, then his family, and then time for himself tagging along in third place, attracts the attention of a scientist who believes that he may have a solution to Doug's problems; cloning. So Doug agrees to the procedure, and an exact copy of him is created. However, physically the clone is an exact copy, but their personalities will differ in certain ways, as this clone is more macho and hard working than Doug. So Doug lets his wife go back to work, while he fills in at home, and the clone works at the construction sites. However, it isn't long before Doug clones himself again, and a more camp, sensitive and domesticated version of him is produced. The clones are made live in the garage, and eventually, they clone themselves, producing a degenerate form of Doug (Something to do with clone genes being bad). It's predictable from here on in, but it's very entertaining as the clones and Doug attempt to elude Laura's suspicions that her Doug hasn't been the same man lately. The special effects are superb in this film as they allow Michael Keaton to portray three to four different characters on the screen at the one time. Keaton provides a brilliant performance, displaying a wide range of acting skills as he portrays completely different personalities of the same character. It's an interesting concept - this cloning thing - and while the screenplay could have had had the clones doing crazier things or getting into more trouble, increasing the possibility of detection, then this could have been a completely different movie. Whether it would have been better of not, I'm not sure, but as it is, "Multiplicity" is a fun movie that I really enjoyed more upon a second viewing and really made me laugh.

    Ever since the box office success of "Groundhog Day", director Harold Ramis has never looked better and even went further when he paired Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in the 1999 classic "Analyze This". In his early film career, he started out at mid-range, even as an actor (though he was excellent in "Ghostbusters"). Before then Ramis depended on getting approval with his audience with slapstick comedies to please the Hollywood masses. "Caddyshack" sort of stood out above the rest, but it was still an overrated film considering the more fresher work he's done later in his career. "Multiplicity" stars Michael Keaton as a construction foreman named Doug Kinney who feels overloaded in his work with very little appreciation from the people surrounding him. Feeling like he's at the end of his rope, he conjures up a crazy solution. By irony, while he is supervising a facility that specializes in cloning techniques, he decides that this might actually work out the kinks of multi-tasking work and family life. Once the doctor gives him the green light to start cloning, a duplicate emerges. However, the clones were not as equal in intelligence as Doug had hoped for. So he kept making more duplicates of himself and now, Doug finds himself in a more deeper predicament than he was before. The comical notion emerges on how Doug is going to fix the messes he got himself.in. Within each clone, they eventually start to pick up on his mental characteristics and it in a way exhibits our ways of the trials and tribulations in dealing with work and family life and we realize that there will never be any shortcuts and that we must take everything one day at a time. Many reviews put this movie down because it mainly lacks in anything remotely logical. I have no reason to argue about that analogy at all. But you have to understand that this is just a comedy that doesn't have to be plausible in any way.

The visual acuity - lighting and sightlines - is 95-percent on target, and as Doug's clones build in their multiplexity, Keaton's synchronicity with his multiplicity is ingenuity incongruity. Directed by Harold Ramis, MULTIPLICITY is bound to be good gratuity from the get-go. Keaton takes it into orbital superfluity. Ably supported by Andie McDowell and her strange accent, reliably confused in all the right places, as is the rest of the cast (Richard Masur, Eugene Levy, Ann Cusack), who feature minimally because Keaton is hogging all the screen time. Message comes through loud and clear - having more of yourself doesn't make life easier, but actually harder; multiplicity breeds instability. There are metaphors on top of metaphors: Doug had to go outside of himself to see himself; in discontinuity, Doug learns continuity; in promiscuity, Doug learns monogamy; in ambiguity, I've lost myself in trying to rhyme everything After "2" clones himself, the real Doug yells without irony, "You can't just go around cloning people!" Doubt anyone else could have pulled off these roles with as much electricity in their authenticity and eccentricity. After all, there's only one Michael Keaton! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    If you are a fan of Michael Keaton, this is a movie you don't want to miss. The plot revolves around Doug Kinney who has a good life but he is always stressed out at work. That is until a doctor confronts him and tells him that he can clone him. He thinks it's a good idea at first. That is until the clone starts interfering in his relationship with his wife. The movie is very funny. You find yourself laughing from beginning to end like I did. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. It's a very funny movie!

    Doug is having a hard time getting everything done. He is being pressured to do more at the construction business he works for, as well as by his wife Laura who wants him to spend time with children Zack and Jennifer. Laura wants to return to her career, as a woman she started out with has been promoted and wants Laura to replace her. But he may have the solution: one of the residents of a development he is supervising has perfected cloning. In fact, it was his clone who signed a deal with Doug's company. So Doug decides to go for it. A second Doug is created, with all his memories. Problem solved! He just has to hide the second Doug in the guest house. The second Doug will go to work while original Doug spends time with the family and takes time for himself--playing golf, for example. You know where this is going. One clone can't do it all. So another one is needed. And possibly another. And each one creates its own kind of chaos. For example, one Doug can make Laura happy (no, not that way, although ...) at home better than original Doug can. And, unfortunately, it's not all funny. That's fine, because there are lessons to be learned and the lead actors are so good I'm willing to see them do anything. Michael Keaton does a very good job playing four distinct characters: Steve (original Doug), Lance (the first clone, a macho pig), Rico (the sensitive and effeminate second clone), and Lenny (because he is a copy of a copy, he is "special"). Andie MacDowell is very funny in a series of scenes that begins with her in a sexy nightie and ends with her in just a pajama top. When more than one Doug is on screen, it really looks as if both or all are there. I wasn't distracted by trying to figure out how they did it. I have a small TV, though. It's a hilarious and rewarding effort.

    O.K. It's not Keaton's best, but it's by Harold Ramis and his films are always fun and unique. A man has himself cloned to simplify his life and, of course, it becomes quite a mess. It sort of plays like a sequel to "Mr. Mom", as Michael (or his clone) eventually ends up playing a "Mr. Mom" so his wife can return to work, this time, as a "Realtor". Michael does a great job portraying 4 different personalities, including a macho-man, a metro-sexual, a "goofy" copy, and himself, Doug One. The funniest scene in the movie involves Laura's rampant sexuality, right after Doug warns all the clones "not to sleep with my wife". Andie Mcdowell, as Laura, is quite good as his long-suffering wife, but she isn't Terri Garr, so she pretty much plays the "straight-man" to Doug and 3 clones. Many plot-holes, as it is quite unbelievable that absolutely no one would notice "triplets" living in the guest room over the garage. Great special effects. It looks real, not matted in. Like Mr. Mom, the film starts to lose its luster and drags towards the end, but wraps up smartly with Laura looking out the car window and, not believing her eyes, sees all 3 clones drive by on their "road trip" South. The cloning process looks about as real as any sci-fi "techno-babel" ever seen on "Star Trek". I just saw this on "This TV" and have yet to see it uncut. It's a 117 minute film and they ran it in 120 minutes with many commercials. Besides speeding up the film, what did they cut out to fit the time slot? Lots of fun, and it's worth at least one viewing. More if you like Michael Keaton at his funniest. And always remember this: "When you make a copy of a copy it's never as sharp as the original!"

    From the director of "Groundhog Day", "Multiplictity" starring Michael Keaton and Andie MacDowell is somewhat underrated in the sense that it's rarely ever heard of nowadays and it was bashed by many critics upon it's release. I've watched it twice now, and I can tell you that it's a very entertaining movie and is quirky, goofy and inane in it's portrayal of what would happen if a man were to clone himself. It's original in it's concept, the story being based on a short story by a man named Chris Miller. Michael Keaton is Doug Kinney, a Los Angeles construction worker who finds that home is just a place he goes to in between chaotic situations at work; one of his employees (Played by Eugene Levy) for example has just gone and dug up the wrong driveway in suburbia. His hectic situation has his stay-at-home wife Laura (Andie Macdowel) frustrated as she would like to get back to work, and not have to take care of their two young children all day. In a fit of rage one day, Doug, who is frustrated as he finds that his work comes first, then his family, and then time for himself tagging along in third place, attracts the attention of a scientist who believes that he may have a solution to Doug's problems; cloning. So Doug agrees to the procedure, and an exact copy of him is created. However, physically the clone is an exact copy, but their personalities will differ in certain ways, as this clone is more macho and hard working than Doug. So Doug lets his wife go back to work, while he fills in at home, and the clone works at the construction sites. However, it isn't long before Doug clones himself again, and a more camp, sensitive and domesticated version of him is produced. The clones are made live in the garage, and eventually, they clone themselves, producing a degenerate form of Doug (Something to do with clone genes being bad). It's predictable from here on in, but it's very entertaining as the clones and Doug attempt to elude Laura's suspicions that her Doug hasn't been the same man lately. The special effects are superb in this film as they allow Michael Keaton to portray three to four different characters on the screen at the one time. Keaton provides a brilliant performance, displaying a wide range of acting skills as he portrays completely different personalities of the same character. It's an interesting concept - this cloning thing - and while the screenplay could have had had the clones doing crazier things or getting into more trouble, increasing the possibility of detection, then this could have been a completely different movie. Whether it would have been better of not, I'm not sure, but as it is, "Multiplicity" is a fun movie that I really enjoyed more upon a second viewing and really made me laugh.

    Ever since the box office success of "Groundhog Day", director Harold Ramis has never looked better and even went further when he paired Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in the 1999 classic "Analyze This". In his early film career, he started out at mid-range, even as an actor (though he was excellent in "Ghostbusters"). Before then Ramis depended on getting approval with his audience with slapstick comedies to please the Hollywood masses. "Caddyshack" sort of stood out above the rest, but it was still an overrated film considering the more fresher work he's done later in his career. "Multiplicity" stars Michael Keaton as a construction foreman named Doug Kinney who feels overloaded in his work with very little appreciation from the people surrounding him. Feeling like he's at the end of his rope, he conjures up a crazy solution. By irony, while he is supervising a facility that specializes in cloning techniques, he decides that this might actually work out the kinks of multi-tasking work and family life. Once the doctor gives him the green light to start cloning, a duplicate emerges. However, the clones were not as equal in intelligence as Doug had hoped for. So he kept making more duplicates of himself and now, Doug finds himself in a more deeper predicament than he was before. The comical notion emerges on how Doug is going to fix the messes he got himself.in. Within each clone, they eventually start to pick up on his mental characteristics and it in a way exhibits our ways of the trials and tribulations in dealing with work and family life and we realize that there will never be any shortcuts and that we must take everything one day at a time. Many reviews put this movie down because it mainly lacks in anything remotely logical. I have no reason to argue about that analogy at all. But you have to understand that this is just a comedy that doesn't have to be plausible in any way. But the overall concept of this comedy has a very deep effect about life itself and the subtle dramatic undertones does indeed garner much for the audience to think about when you're in a similar situation that Doug is facing in his life. However, Keaton's silly humor will likely keep you entertained at the same time. And this is where we see the improvements that Ramis has accomplished as a director and writer. He doesn't have to depend on having lazy jerks screwing with every woman they lay eyes on, or people doing disgusting bodily functions like farting and burping just get the viewers attention. And though there is very little in terms of content. Your kids won't have to worry about stuff like nudity or gratuitous course language. If there were changes made, it wouldn't be for the better. It might come come off as too goofy or too dramatic or maybe even a little bit of both. Sometimes things are left best just the way it is, and "Multiplicity" is one of those movies.

    Michael Keaton can never be doubted. Here's an actor who's done great work throughout his career. Right from the 1980's to the 1990's & to the 2000's, Keaton's range & confidence as a performer has only raised above. And 'Multiplicity' very correctly reaffirms that fact right. 'Multiplicity' Synopsis: A man who never has enough time for the things he wants to do is offered the opportunity to have himself duplicated. 'Multiplicity' is an entertaining film. It runs smoothly & culminates way before it could have doomed. The interesting concept, gets it's due, as it's transferred on-screen efficiently. Harold Ramis's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Keaton's performance is truly fantastic in here. He plays 4 characters with great variety & confidence. He is the backbone of this film. Among other performances, Andie MacDowell does well, while Eugene Levy & Harris Yulin lend support. On the whole, If You're A Keaton Fan, well then 'Multiplicity' is your best bet.

    This is not the best comedy ever made, but in all fairness I have to say that I've sat through more than a few comedies and never even cracked a smile. This one on a handful of occasions actually had me laughing out loud, so for that reason alone I have to say it's pretty solid. Michael Keaton is what makes this work so well. It's not just because he's the star - it's that he stars in four roles. It's not a costume comedy, though, which makes his performance all the better. He essentially plays the same character with tweaks and variations to differentiate between them, and he pulls it off brilliantly. Each character is a character of his own, and even the interactions between the characters he plays are pulled off flawlessly so that everything is very natural. The story is tailor made for a comedy revolving around mistaken identity. Keaton's basic character is Doug Kinney, an overworked contractor who's finding that he doesn't have time to keep everything in his life in balance. Hoping for a miracle to help keep his life together he finds himself doing some work for a geneticist who's discovered the secret of "cloning" humans. It's not scientific - the "clones" come out as exact physical replicas rather than as newborn babies with identical genetic material to the original - but this is a comedy, so who cares! It works! Starting with one clone (named, simply, "2") Doug finds that even one copy isn't enough, so he makes another (named, appropriately, "3.") 2 and 3 are completely different from Doug and polar opposites from each other. 2 is a macho, take charge type who happily takes over the contracting business but chafes about having to stay out of sight when he'd much rather be picking up women, while 3 is an effeminate, stay at home type who loves cooking and cleaning. Eventually, 2 and 3 find themselves over-burdened, and they create another clone (named - guess what - "4.") except that 4 is a copy of copy and so, therefore, imperfect, for lack of a better way to put it. Intended to make Doug's life easier, all these 3 clones do is introduce increasing chaos, and at times it is hilarious. Really the only other cast member of note is Andie MacDowell (who teams again with director Harold Ramis as she did in "Groundhog Day") as Doug's increasingly confused wife Laura. Unfortunately, the movie revolves so completely around Doug and the clones that MacDowell, while she was good enough and as always quite lovely, seemed to fade into the background more often than not, so that her talents were generally underused. She's more impressive opposite Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day" than she is here, but that's more a result of the type of movie and the role that it asked of her rather than any deficiency in her performance. This is almost two hours long - which might be a little bit too much for this type of silly comedy. It gets to that length perhaps by trying to introduce too much "drama" (if you will) in the last while about Doug and Laura's faltering marriage. Still, it's a funny movie, and Keaton's performance is worth watching. (7/10)

    A very funny movie. The parts Keaton plays are all different from each other and the movie gets funnier as it goes along unlike other comedies that are played out towards the end. The final clone is a work of art, and how the other "characters" react to it is also hilarious. I watch this movie any time it is on television. There isn't really another movie like it and Keaton's deviation away form harder movies like Pacific Heights shows he's a good actor. There has been a lot of negative reviews here for the film but I can't personally see the problem that a lot of people have with it, it's not meant to be serious and provides great entertainment. Worth a watch.

    This movie is not the best of it's genre, but is definitely a good movie if you are not expecting a great movie.This movie is enjoyable and have some very funny moments.It worth to be seen. Doug Kinney is a man who has many problems.He is very busy with his job and doesn't have much time for his family.In one day at work he meets a man who "saves" him.He is multiplied by this man and now he has much time for his family.His clones replace him at work and now he can stay with his kids, but this is not what he thought to be an easy thing.His clones has the same appearance but different personalities.One is shy, one is serious and one is retarded.It's message is that we all are different.

    One person sells MULTIPLICITY: Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. Keaton is Doug Kinney, so swamped in career and family life that in order to find felicity for himself, he creates a clone to share the burden of domesticity. But one clone turns into two clones turns into three clones the complicity confusing his workmates, his wife (Andie MacDowell), and especially himself. Keaton displays his magnificent multifaceted elasticity by playing every clone with a distinct personality - and never lapses or loses conviction in the four different archetypes. Keaton's performances are so subtle, and work so well against each of himself, that we never notice how stunning his portrayals are; how much blood, sweat and CGI must have gone into learning his lines in a certain character and then playing off three other actors who would eventually be replaced by him - and playing off them four different times as four different types! It is a jaw-dropping performance. Clone Number 1 (whom Doug calls "2") is The Bruce Willis - the masculine side of Doug predominant; "3" is Doug's feminine side predominant; when "2" clones himself to make "4," it's a monkey boy, because "you know how copies of a copy are not as good as the original..." Don't bring analyticity  or it gets disturbing. So the movie never dwells on the cloning process or its moral implications. The only moral authority is Doug's Rule Number One: "No one sleeps with my wife except me!" Of course, one rainy night when Doug "1" is away, that specificity is not simplicity when Doug's wife wants fluidity Keaton is in every single scene, yet because he plays the four personalities so convincingly, when Doug "1" spends so much time offscreen trying to stay on eternal vacation we feel like we're watching three other guys playing Keaton playing Doug! We kick ourselves to remind us it's Keaton on screen IN PERPETUITY. The visual acuity - lighting and sightlines - is 95-percent on target, and as Doug's clones build in their multiplexity, Keaton's synchronicity with his multiplicity is ingenuity incongruity. Directed by Harold Ramis, MULTIPLICITY is bound to be good gratuity from the get-go. Keaton takes it into orbital superfluity. Ably supported by Andie McDowell and her strange accent, reliably confused in all the right places, as is the rest of the cast (Richard Masur, Eugene Levy, Ann Cusack), who feature minimally because Keaton is hogging all the screen time.

There are metaphors on top of metaphors: Doug had to go outside of himself to see himself; in discontinuity, Doug learns continuity; in promiscuity, Doug learns monogamy; in ambiguity, I've lost myself in trying to rhyme everything After "2" clones himself, the real Doug yells without irony, "You can't just go around cloning people!" Doubt anyone else could have pulled off these roles with as much electricity in their authenticity and eccentricity. After all, there's only one Michael Keaton! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

Feeling like he's at the end of his rope, he conjures up a crazy solution. By irony, while he is supervising a facility that specializes in cloning techniques, he decides that this might actually work out the kinks of multi-tasking work and family life. Once the doctor gives him the green light to start cloning, a duplicate emerges. However, the clones were not as equal in intelligence as Doug had hoped for. So he kept making more duplicates of himself and now, Doug finds himself in a more deeper predicament than he was before. The comical notion emerges on how Doug is going to fix the messes he got himself.in. Within each clone, they eventually start to pick up on his mental characteristics and it in a way exhibits our ways of the trials and tribulations in dealing with work and family life and we realize that there will never be any shortcuts and that we must take everything one day at a time. Many reviews put this movie down because it mainly lacks in anything remotely logical. I have no reason to argue about that analogy at all. But you have to understand that this is just a comedy that doesn't have to be plausible in any way. But the overall concept of this comedy has a very deep effect about life itself and the subtle dramatic undertones does indeed garner much for the audience to think about when you're in a similar situation that Doug is facing in his life. However, Keaton's silly humor will likely keep you entertained at the same time. And this is where we see the improvements that Ramis has accomplished as a director and writer. He doesn't have to depend on having lazy jerks screwing with every woman they lay eyes on, or people doing disgusting bodily functions like farting and burping just get the viewers attention. And though there is very little in terms of content. Your kids won't have to worry about stuff like nudity or gratuitous course language. If there were changes made, it wouldn't be for the better. It might come come off as too goofy or too dramatic or maybe even a little bit of both. Sometimes things are left best just the way it is, and "Multiplicity" is one of those movies.

    Michael Keaton can never be doubted. Here's an actor who's done great work throughout his career. Right from the 1980's to the 1990's & to the 2000's, Keaton's range & confidence as a performer has only raised above. And 'Multiplicity' very correctly reaffirms that fact right. 'Multiplicity' Synopsis: A man who never has enough time for the things he wants to do is offered the opportunity to have himself duplicated. 'Multiplicity' is an entertaining film. It runs smoothly & culminates way before it could have doomed. The interesting concept, gets it's due, as it's transferred on-screen efficiently. Harold Ramis's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Keaton's performance is truly fantastic in here. He plays 4 characters with great variety & confidence. He is the backbone of this film. Among other performances, Andie MacDowell does well, while Eugene Levy & Harris Yulin lend support. On the whole, If You're A Keaton Fan, well then 'Multiplicity' is your best bet.

    This is not the best comedy ever made, but in all fairness I have to say that I've sat through more than a few comedies and never even cracked a smile. This one on a handful of occasions actually had me laughing out loud, so for that reason alone I have to say it's pretty solid. Michael Keaton is what makes this work so well. It's not just because he's the star - it's that he stars in four roles. It's not a costume comedy, though, which makes his performance all the better. He essentially plays the same character with tweaks and variations to differentiate between them, and he pulls it off brilliantly. Each character is a character of his own, and even the interactions between the characters he plays are pulled off flawlessly so that everything is very natural. The story is tailor made for a comedy revolving around mistaken identity. Keaton's basic character is Doug Kinney, an overworked contractor who's finding that he doesn't have time to keep everything in his life in balance. Hoping for a miracle to help keep his life together he finds himself doing some work for a geneticist who's discovered the secret of "cloning" humans. It's not scientific - the "clones" come out as exact physical replicas rather than as newborn babies with identical genetic material to the original - but this is a comedy, so who cares! It works! Starting with one clone (named, simply, "2") Doug finds that even one copy isn't enough, so he makes another (named, appropriately, "3.") 2 and 3 are completely different from Doug and polar opposites from each other. 2 is a macho, take charge type who happily takes over the contracting business but chafes about having to stay out of sight when he'd much rather be picking up women, while 3 is an effeminate, stay at home type who loves cooking and cleaning. Eventually, 2 and 3 find themselves over-burdened, and they create another clone (named - guess what - "4.") except that 4 is a copy of copy and so, therefore, imperfect, for lack of a better way to put it. Intended to make Doug's life easier, all these 3 clones do is introduce increasing chaos, and at times it is hilarious. Really the only other cast member of note is Andie MacDowell (who teams again with director Harold Ramis as she did in "Groundhog Day") as Doug's increasingly confused wife Laura. Unfortunately, the movie revolves so completely around Doug and the clones that MacDowell, while she was good enough and as always quite lovely, seemed to fade into the background more often than not, so that her talents were generally underused. She's more impressive opposite Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day" than she is here, but that's more a result of the type of movie and the role that it asked of her rather than any deficiency in her performance. This is almost two hours long - which might be a little bit too much for this type of silly comedy. It gets to that length perhaps by trying to introduce too much "drama" (if you will) in the last while about Doug and Laura's faltering marriage. Still, it's a funny movie, and Keaton's performance is worth watching. (7/10)

    A very funny movie. The parts Keaton plays are all different from each other and the movie gets funnier as it goes along unlike other comedies that are played out towards the end. The final clone is a work of art, and how the other "characters" react to it is also hilarious. I watch this movie any time it is on television. There isn't really another movie like it and Keaton's deviation away form harder movies like Pacific Heights shows he's a good actor. There has been a lot of negative reviews here for the film but I can't personally see the problem that a lot of people have with it, it's not meant to be serious and provides great entertainment. Worth a watch.

    One person sells MULTIPLICITY: Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. Keaton is Doug Kinney, so swamped in career and family life that in order to find felicity for himself, he creates a clone to share the burden of domesticity. But one clone turns into two clones turns into three clones the complicity confusing his workmates, his wife (Andie MacDowell), and especially himself. Keaton displays his magnificent multifaceted elasticity by playing every clone with a distinct personality - and never lapses or loses conviction in the four different archetypes. Keaton's performances are so subtle, and work so well against each of himself, that we never notice how stunning his portrayals are; how much blood, sweat and CGI must have gone into learning his lines in a certain character and then playing off three other actors who would eventually be replaced by him - and playing off them four different times as four different types! It is a jaw-dropping performance. Clone Number 1 (whom Doug calls "2") is The Bruce Willis - the masculine side of Doug predominant; "3" is Doug's feminine side predominant; when "2" clones himself to make "4," it's a monkey boy, because "you know how copies of a copy are not as good as the original..." Don't bring analyticity  or it gets disturbing. So the movie never dwells on the cloning process or its moral implications. The only moral authority is Doug's Rule Number One: "No one sleeps with my wife except me!" Of course, one rainy night when Doug "1" is away, that specificity is not simplicity when Doug's wife wants fluidity Keaton is in every single scene, yet because he plays the four personalities so convincingly, when Doug "1" spends so much time offscreen trying to stay on eternal vacation we feel like we're watching three other guys playing Keaton playing Doug! We kick ourselves to remind us it's Keaton on screen IN PERPETUITY. The visual acuity - lighting and sightlines - is 95-percent on target, and as Doug's clones build in their multiplexity, Keaton's synchronicity with his multiplicity is ingenuity incongruity. Directed by Harold Ramis, MULTIPLICITY is bound to be good gratuity from the get-go. Keaton takes it into orbital superfluity. Ably supported by Andie McDowell and her strange accent, reliably confused in all the right places, as is the rest of the cast (Richard Masur, Eugene Levy, Ann Cusack), who feature minimally because Keaton is hogging all the screen time. Message comes through loud and clear - having more of yourself doesn't make life easier, but actually harder; multiplicity breeds instability. There are metaphors on top of metaphors: Doug had to go outside of himself to see himself; in discontinuity, Doug learns continuity; in promiscuity, Doug learns monogamy; in ambiguity, I've lost myself in trying to rhyme everything After "2" clones himself, the real Doug yells without irony, "You can't just go around cloning people!" Doubt anyone else could have pulled off these roles with as much electricity in their authenticity and eccentricity. After all, there's only one Michael Keaton! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    If you are a fan of Michael Keaton, this is a movie you don't want to miss. The plot revolves around Doug Kinney who has a good life but he is always stressed out at work. That is until a doctor confronts him and tells him that he can clone him. He thinks it's a good idea at first. That is until the clone starts interfering in his relationship with his wife. The movie is very funny. You find yourself laughing from beginning to end like I did. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. It's a very funny movie!

    Doug is having a hard time getting everything done. He is being pressured to do more at the construction business he works for, as well as by his wife Laura who wants him to spend time with children Zack and Jennifer. Laura wants to return to her career, as a woman she started out with has been promoted and wants Laura to replace her. But he may have the solution: one of the residents of a development he is supervising has perfected cloning. In fact, it was his clone who signed a deal with Doug's company. So Doug decides to go for it. A second Doug is created, with all his memories. Problem solved! He just has to hide the second Doug in the guest house. The second Doug will go to work while original Doug spends time with the family and takes time for himself--playing golf, for example. You know where this is going. One clone can't do it all. So another one is needed. And possibly another. And each one creates its own kind of chaos. For example, one Doug can make Laura happy (no, not that way, although ...) at home better than original Doug can. And, unfortunately, it's not all funny. That's fine, because there are lessons to be learned and the lead actors are so good I'm willing to see them do anything. Michael Keaton does a very good job playing four distinct characters: Steve (original Doug), Lance (the first clone, a macho pig), Rico (the sensitive and effeminate second clone), and Lenny (because he is a copy of a copy, he is "special"). Andie MacDowell is very funny in a series of scenes that begins with her in a sexy nightie and ends with her in just a pajama top. When more than one Doug is on screen, it really looks as if both or all are there. I wasn't distracted by trying to figure out how they did it. I have a small TV, though. It's a hilarious and rewarding effort.

    O.K. It's not Keaton's best, but it's by Harold Ramis and his films are always fun and unique. A man has himself cloned to simplify his life and, of course, it becomes quite a mess. It sort of plays like a sequel to "Mr. Mom", as Michael (or his clone) eventually ends up playing a "Mr. Mom" so his wife can return to work, this time, as a "Realtor". Michael does a great job portraying 4 different personalities, including a macho-man, a metro-sexual, a "goofy" copy, and himself, Doug One. The funniest scene in the movie involves Laura's rampant sexuality, right after Doug warns all the clones "not to sleep with my wife". Andie Mcdowell, as Laura, is quite good as his long-suffering wife, but she isn't Terri Garr, so she pretty much plays the "straight-man" to Doug and 3 clones. Many plot-holes, as it is quite unbelievable that absolutely no one would notice "triplets" living in the guest room over the garage. Great special effects. It looks real, not matted in. Like Mr. Mom, the film starts to lose its luster and drags towards the end, but wraps up smartly with Laura looking out the car window and, not believing her eyes, sees all 3 clones drive by on their "road trip" South. The cloning process looks about as real as any sci-fi "techno-babel" ever seen on "Star Trek". I just saw this on "This TV" and have yet to see it uncut. It's a 117 minute film and they ran it in 120 minutes with many commercials. Besides speeding up the film, what did they cut out to fit the time slot? Lots of fun, and it's worth at least one viewing. More if you like Michael Keaton at his funniest. And always remember this: "When you make a copy of a copy it's never as sharp as the original!"

    From the director of "Groundhog Day", "Multiplictity" starring Michael Keaton and Andie MacDowell is somewhat underrated in the sense that it's rarely ever heard of nowadays and it was bashed by many critics upon it's release. I've watched it twice now, and I can tell you that it's a very entertaining movie and is quirky, goofy and inane in it's portrayal of what would happen if a man were to clone himself. It's original in it's concept, the story being based on a short story by a man named Chris Miller. Michael Keaton is Doug Kinney, a Los Angeles construction worker who finds that home is just a place he goes to in between chaotic situations at work; one of his employees (Played by Eugene Levy) for example has just gone and dug up the wrong driveway in suburbia. His hectic situation has his stay-at-home wife Laura (Andie Macdowel) frustrated as she would like to get back to work, and not have to take care of their two young children all day. In a fit of rage one day, Doug, who is frustrated as he finds that his work comes first, then his family, and then time for himself tagging along in third place, attracts the attention of a scientist who believes that he may have a solution to Doug's problems; cloning. So Doug agrees to the procedure, and an exact copy of him is created. However, physically the clone is an exact copy, but their personalities will differ in certain ways, as this clone is more macho and hard working than Doug. So Doug lets his wife go back to work, while he fills in at home, and the clone works at the construction sites. However, it isn't long before Doug clones himself again, and a more camp, sensitive and domesticated version of him is produced. The clones are made live in the garage, and eventually, they clone themselves, producing a degenerate form of Doug (Something to do with clone genes being bad). It's predictable from here on in, but it's very entertaining as the clones and Doug attempt to elude Laura's suspicions that her Doug hasn't been the same man lately. The special effects are superb in this film as they allow Michael Keaton to portray three to four different characters on the screen at the one time. Keaton provides a brilliant performance, displaying a wide range of acting skills as he portrays completely different personalities of the same character. It's an interesting concept - this cloning thing - and while the screenplay could have had had the clones doing crazier things or getting into more trouble, increasing the possibility of detection, then this could have been a completely different movie. Whether it would have been better of not, I'm not sure, but as it is, "Multiplicity" is a fun movie that I really enjoyed more upon a second viewing and really made me laugh.

    Ever since the box office success of "Groundhog Day", director Harold Ramis has never looked better and even went further when he paired Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in the 1999 classic "Analyze This". In his early film career, he started out at mid-range, even as an actor (though he was excellent in "Ghostbusters"). Before then Ramis depended on getting approval with his audience with slapstick comedies to please the Hollywood masses. "Caddyshack" sort of stood out above the rest, but it was still an overrated film considering the more fresher work he's done later in his career. "Multiplicity" stars Michael Keaton as a construction foreman named Doug Kinney who feels overloaded in his work with very little appreciation from the people surrounding him. Feeling like he's at the end of his rope, he conjures up a crazy solution. By irony, while he is supervising a facility that specializes in cloning techniques, he decides that this might actually work out the kinks of multi-tasking work and family life.

Of course, one rainy night when Doug "1" is away, that specificity is not simplicity when Doug's wife wants fluidity Keaton is in every single scene, yet because he plays the four personalities so convincingly, when Doug "1" spends so much time offscreen trying to stay on eternal vacation we feel like we're watching three other guys playing Keaton playing Doug! We kick ourselves to remind us it's Keaton on screen IN PERPETUITY. The visual acuity - lighting and sightlines - is 95-percent on target, and as Doug's clones build in their multiplexity, Keaton's synchronicity with his multiplicity is ingenuity incongruity. Directed by Harold Ramis, MULTIPLICITY is bound to be good gratuity from the get-go. Keaton takes it into orbital superfluity. Ably supported by Andie McDowell and her strange accent, reliably confused in all the right places, as is the rest of the cast (Richard Masur, Eugene Levy, Ann Cusack), who feature minimally because Keaton is hogging all the screen time. Message comes through loud and clear - having more of yourself doesn't make life easier, but actually harder; multiplicity breeds instability. There are metaphors on top of metaphors: Doug had to go outside of himself to see himself; in discontinuity, Doug learns continuity; in promiscuity, Doug learns monogamy; in ambiguity, I've lost myself in trying to rhyme everything After "2" clones himself, the real Doug yells without irony, "You can't just go around cloning people!" Doubt anyone else could have pulled off these roles with as much electricity in their authenticity and eccentricity. After all, there's only one Michael Keaton! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    If you are a fan of Michael Keaton, this is a movie you don't want to miss. The plot revolves around Doug Kinney who has a good life but he is always stressed out at work. That is until a doctor confronts him and tells him that he can clone him. He thinks it's a good idea at first. That is until the clone starts interfering in his relationship with his wife. The movie is very funny. You find yourself laughing from beginning to end like I did. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. It's a very funny movie!

    Doug is having a hard time getting everything done. He is being pressured to do more at the construction business he works for, as well as by his wife Laura who wants him to spend time with children Zack and Jennifer. Laura wants to return to her career, as a woman she started out with has been promoted and wants Laura to replace her. But he may have the solution: one of the residents of a development he is supervising has perfected cloning. In fact, it was his clone who signed a deal with Doug's company. So Doug decides to go for it. A second Doug is created, with all his memories. Problem solved! He just has to hide the second Doug in the guest house. The second Doug will go to work while original Doug spends time with the family and takes time for himself--playing golf, for example. You know where this is going. One clone can't do it all. So another one is needed. And possibly another. And each one creates its own kind of chaos. For example, one Doug can make Laura happy (no, not that way, although ...) at home better than original Doug can. And, unfortunately, it's not all funny. That's fine, because there are lessons to be learned and the lead actors are so good I'm willing to see them do anything. Michael Keaton does a very good job playing four distinct characters: Steve (original Doug), Lance (the first clone, a macho pig), Rico (the sensitive and effeminate second clone), and Lenny (because he is a copy of a copy, he is "special"). Andie MacDowell is very funny in a series of scenes that begins with her in a sexy nightie and ends with her in just a pajama top. When more than one Doug is on screen, it really looks as if both or all are there. I wasn't distracted by trying to figure out how they did it. I have a small TV, though. It's a hilarious and rewarding effort.

    O.K. It's not Keaton's best, but it's by Harold Ramis and his films are always fun and unique. A man has himself cloned to simplify his life and, of course, it becomes quite a mess. It sort of plays like a sequel to "Mr. Mom", as Michael (or his clone) eventually ends up playing a "Mr. Mom" so his wife can return to work, this time, as a "Realtor". Michael does a great job portraying 4 different personalities, including a macho-man, a metro-sexual, a "goofy" copy, and himself, Doug One. The funniest scene in the movie involves Laura's rampant sexuality, right after Doug warns all the clones "not to sleep with my wife". Andie Mcdowell, as Laura, is quite good as his long-suffering wife, but she isn't Terri Garr, so she pretty much plays the "straight-man" to Doug and 3 clones. Many plot-holes, as it is quite unbelievable that absolutely no one would notice "triplets" living in the guest room over the garage. Great special effects. It looks real, not matted in. Like Mr. Mom, the film starts to lose its luster and drags towards the end, but wraps up smartly with Laura looking out the car window and, not believing her eyes, sees all 3 clones drive by on their "road trip" South. The cloning process looks about as real as any sci-fi "techno-babel" ever seen on "Star Trek". I just saw this on "This TV" and have yet to see it uncut. It's a 117 minute film and they ran it in 120 minutes with many commercials. Besides speeding up the film, what did they cut out to fit the time slot? Lots of fun, and it's worth at least one viewing. More if you like Michael Keaton at his funniest. And always remember this: "When you make a copy of a copy it's never as sharp as the original!"

    From the director of "Groundhog Day", "Multiplictity" starring Michael Keaton and Andie MacDowell is somewhat underrated in the sense that it's rarely ever heard of nowadays and it was bashed by many critics upon it's release. I've watched it twice now, and I can tell you that it's a very entertaining movie and is quirky, goofy and inane in it's portrayal of what would happen if a man were to clone himself. It's original in it's concept, the story being based on a short story by a man named Chris Miller. Michael Keaton is Doug Kinney, a Los Angeles construction worker who finds that home is just a place he goes to in between chaotic situations at work; one of his employees (Played by Eugene Levy) for example has just gone and dug up the wrong driveway in suburbia. His hectic situation has his stay-at-home wife Laura (Andie Macdowel) frustrated as she would like to get back to work, and not have to take care of their two young children all day. In a fit of rage one day, Doug, who is frustrated as he finds that his work comes first, then his family, and then time for himself tagging along in third place, attracts the attention of a scientist who believes that he may have a solution to Doug's problems; cloning. So Doug agrees to the procedure, and an exact copy of him is created. However, physically the clone is an exact copy, but their personalities will differ in certain ways, as this clone is more macho and hard working than Doug. So Doug lets his wife go back to work, while he fills in at home, and the clone works at the construction sites. However, it isn't long before Doug clones himself again, and a more camp, sensitive and domesticated version of him is produced. The clones are made live in the garage, and eventually, they clone themselves, producing a degenerate form of Doug (Something to do with clone genes being bad). It's predictable from here on in, but it's very entertaining as the clones and Doug attempt to elude Laura's suspicions that her Doug hasn't been the same man lately. The special effects are superb in this film as they allow Michael Keaton to portray three to four different characters on the screen at the one time. Keaton provides a brilliant performance, displaying a wide range of acting skills as he portrays completely different personalities of the same character. It's an interesting concept - this cloning thing - and while the screenplay could have had had the clones doing crazier things or getting into more trouble, increasing the possibility of detection, then this could have been a completely different movie. Whether it would have been better of not, I'm not sure, but as it is, "Multiplicity" is a fun movie that I really enjoyed more upon a second viewing and really made me laugh.

    Ever since the box office success of "Groundhog Day", director Harold Ramis has never looked better and even went further when he paired Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in the 1999 classic "Analyze This". In his early film career, he started out at mid-range, even as an actor (though he was excellent in "Ghostbusters"). Before then Ramis depended on getting approval with his audience with slapstick comedies to please the Hollywood masses. "Caddyshack" sort of stood out above the rest, but it was still an overrated film considering the more fresher work he's done later in his career. "Multiplicity" stars Michael Keaton as a construction foreman named Doug Kinney who feels overloaded in his work with very little appreciation from the people surrounding him. Feeling like he's at the end of his rope, he conjures up a crazy solution. By irony, while he is supervising a facility that specializes in cloning techniques, he decides that this might actually work out the kinks of multi-tasking work and family life. Once the doctor gives him the green light to start cloning, a duplicate emerges. However, the clones were not as equal in intelligence as Doug had hoped for. So he kept making more duplicates of himself and now, Doug finds himself in a more deeper predicament than he was before. The comical notion emerges on how Doug is going to fix the messes he got himself.in. Within each clone, they eventually start to pick up on his mental characteristics and it in a way exhibits our ways of the trials and tribulations in dealing with work and family life and we realize that there will never be any shortcuts and that we must take everything one day at a time. Many reviews put this movie down because it mainly lacks in anything remotely logical. I have no reason to argue about that analogy at all. But you have to understand that this is just a comedy that doesn't have to be plausible in any way. But the overall concept of this comedy has a very deep effect about life itself and the subtle dramatic undertones does indeed garner much for the audience to think about when you're in a similar situation that Doug is facing in his life. However, Keaton's silly humor will likely keep you entertained at the same time. And this is where we see the improvements that Ramis has accomplished as a director and writer. He doesn't have to depend on having lazy jerks screwing with every woman they lay eyes on, or people doing disgusting bodily functions like farting and burping just get the viewers attention. And though there is very little in terms of content. Your kids won't have to worry about stuff like nudity or gratuitous course language. If there were changes made, it wouldn't be for the better. It might come come off as too goofy or too dramatic or maybe even a little bit of both. Sometimes things are left best just the way it is, and "Multiplicity" is one of those movies.

    Michael Keaton can never be doubted. Here's an actor who's done great work throughout his career. Right from the 1980's to the 1990's & to the 2000's, Keaton's range & confidence as a performer has only raised above. And 'Multiplicity' very correctly reaffirms that fact right. 'Multiplicity' Synopsis: A man who never has enough time for the things he wants to do is offered the opportunity to have himself duplicated. 'Multiplicity' is an entertaining film. It runs smoothly & culminates way before it could have doomed. The interesting concept, gets it's due, as it's transferred on-screen efficiently. Harold Ramis's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Keaton's performance is truly fantastic in here. He plays 4 characters with great variety & confidence. He is the backbone of this film. Among other performances, Andie MacDowell does well, while Eugene Levy & Harris Yulin lend support. On the whole, If You're A Keaton Fan, well then 'Multiplicity' is your best bet.

    This is not the best comedy ever made, but in all fairness I have to say that I've sat through more than a few comedies and never even cracked a smile. This one on a handful of occasions actually had me laughing out loud, so for that reason alone I have to say it's pretty solid. Michael Keaton is what makes this work so well. It's not just because he's the star - it's that he stars in four roles. It's not a costume comedy, though, which makes his performance all the better. He essentially plays the same character with tweaks and variations to differentiate between them, and he pulls it off brilliantly. Each character is a character of his own, and even the interactions between the characters he plays are pulled off flawlessly so that everything is very natural. The story is tailor made for a comedy revolving around mistaken identity. Keaton's basic character is Doug Kinney, an overworked contractor who's finding that he doesn't have time to keep everything in his life in balance. Hoping for a miracle to help keep his life together he finds himself doing some work for a geneticist who's discovered the secret of "cloning" humans. It's not scientific - the "clones" come out as exact physical replicas rather than as newborn babies with identical genetic material to the original - but this is a comedy, so who cares! It works! Starting with one clone (named, simply, "2") Doug finds that even one copy isn't enough, so he makes another (named, appropriately, "3.") 2 and 3 are completely different from Doug and polar opposites from each other. 2 is a macho, take charge type who happily takes over the contracting business but chafes about having to stay out of sight when he'd much rather be picking up women, while 3 is an effeminate, stay at home type who loves cooking and cleaning. Eventually, 2 and 3 find themselves over-burdened, and they create another clone (named - guess what - "4.") except that 4 is a copy of copy and so, therefore, imperfect, for lack of a better way to put it. Intended to make Doug's life easier, all these 3 clones do is introduce increasing chaos, and at times it is hilarious. Really the only other cast member of note is Andie MacDowell (who teams again with director Harold Ramis as she did in "Groundhog Day") as Doug's increasingly confused wife Laura. Unfortunately, the movie revolves so completely around Doug and the clones that MacDowell, while she was good enough and as always quite lovely, seemed to fade into the background more often than not, so that her talents were generally underused. She's more impressive opposite Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day" than she is here, but that's more a result of the type of movie and the role that it asked of her rather than any deficiency in her performance. This is almost two hours long - which might be a little bit too much for this type of silly comedy. It gets to that length perhaps by trying to introduce too much "drama" (if you will) in the last while about Doug and Laura's faltering marriage. Still, it's a funny movie, and Keaton's performance is worth watching. (7/10)

    A very funny movie. The parts Keaton plays are all different from each other and the movie gets funnier as it goes along unlike other comedies that are played out towards the end. The final clone is a work of art, and how the other "characters" react to it is also hilarious. I watch this movie any time it is on television. There isn't really another movie like it and Keaton's deviation away form harder movies like Pacific Heights shows he's a good actor. There has been a lot of negative reviews here for the film but I can't personally see the problem that a lot of people have with it, it's not meant to be serious and provides great entertainment. Worth a watch.

Doug Kinney is a man who has many problems.He is very busy with his job and doesn't have much time for his family.In one day at work he meets a man who "saves" him.He is multiplied by this man and now he has much time for his family.His clones replace him at work and now he can stay with his kids, but this is not what he thought to be an easy thing.His clones has the same appearance but different personalities.One is shy, one is serious and one is retarded.It's message is that we all are different.

    One person sells MULTIPLICITY: Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. Keaton is Doug Kinney, so swamped in career and family life that in order to find felicity for himself, he creates a clone to share the burden of domesticity. But one clone turns into two clones turns into three clones the complicity confusing his workmates, his wife (Andie MacDowell), and especially himself. Keaton displays his magnificent multifaceted elasticity by playing every clone with a distinct personality - and never lapses or loses conviction in the four different archetypes. Keaton's performances are so subtle, and work so well against each of himself, that we never notice how stunning his portrayals are; how much blood, sweat and CGI must have gone into learning his lines in a certain character and then playing off three other actors who would eventually be replaced by him - and playing off them four different times as four different types! It is a jaw-dropping performance. Clone Number 1 (whom Doug calls "2") is The Bruce Willis - the masculine side of Doug predominant; "3" is Doug's feminine side predominant; when "2" clones himself to make "4," it's a monkey boy, because "you know how copies of a copy are not as good as the original..." Don't bring analyticity  or it gets disturbing. So the movie never dwells on the cloning process or its moral implications. The only moral authority is Doug's Rule Number One: "No one sleeps with my wife except me!" Of course, one rainy night when Doug "1" is away, that specificity is not simplicity when Doug's wife wants fluidity Keaton is in every single scene, yet because he plays the four personalities so convincingly, when Doug "1" spends so much time offscreen trying to stay on eternal vacation we feel like we're watching three other guys playing Keaton playing Doug! We kick ourselves to remind us it's Keaton on screen IN PERPETUITY. The visual acuity - lighting and sightlines - is 95-percent on target, and as Doug's clones build in their multiplexity, Keaton's synchronicity with his multiplicity is ingenuity incongruity. Directed by Harold Ramis, MULTIPLICITY is bound to be good gratuity from the get-go. Keaton takes it into orbital superfluity. Ably supported by Andie McDowell and her strange accent, reliably confused in all the right places, as is the rest of the cast (Richard Masur, Eugene Levy, Ann Cusack), who feature minimally because Keaton is hogging all the screen time.

There are metaphors on top of metaphors: Doug had to go outside of himself to see himself; in discontinuity, Doug learns continuity; in promiscuity, Doug learns monogamy; in ambiguity, I've lost myself in trying to rhyme everything After "2" clones himself, the real Doug yells without irony, "You can't just go around cloning people!" Doubt anyone else could have pulled off these roles with as much electricity in their authenticity and eccentricity. After all, there's only one Michael Keaton! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

"Caddyshack" sort of stood out above the rest, but it was still an overrated film considering the more fresher work he's done later in his career. "Multiplicity" stars Michael Keaton as a construction foreman named Doug Kinney who feels overloaded in his work with very little appreciation from the people surrounding him. Feeling like he's at the end of his rope, he conjures up a crazy solution. By irony, while he is supervising a facility that specializes in cloning techniques, he decides that this might actually work out the kinks of multi-tasking work and family life. Once the doctor gives him the green light to start cloning, a duplicate emerges. However, the clones were not as equal in intelligence as Doug had hoped for. So he kept making more duplicates of himself and now, Doug finds himself in a more deeper predicament than he was before. The comical notion emerges on how Doug is going to fix the messes he got himself.in. Within each clone, they eventually start to pick up on his mental characteristics and it in a way exhibits our ways of the trials and tribulations in dealing with work and family life and we realize that there will never be any shortcuts and that we must take everything one day at a time. Many reviews put this movie down because it mainly lacks in anything remotely logical. I have no reason to argue about that analogy at all. But you have to understand that this is just a comedy that doesn't have to be plausible in any way. But the overall concept of this comedy has a very deep effect about life itself and the subtle dramatic undertones does indeed garner much for the audience to think about when you're in a similar situation that Doug is facing in his life. However, Keaton's silly humor will likely keep you entertained at the same time. And this is where we see the improvements that Ramis has accomplished as a director and writer. He doesn't have to depend on having lazy jerks screwing with every woman they lay eyes on, or people doing disgusting bodily functions like farting and burping just get the viewers attention. And though there is very little in terms of content. Your kids won't have to worry about stuff like nudity or gratuitous course language. If there were changes made, it wouldn't be for the better. It might come come off as too goofy or too dramatic or maybe even a little bit of both. Sometimes things are left best just the way it is, and "Multiplicity" is one of those movies.

    Michael Keaton can never be doubted. Here's an actor who's done great work throughout his career. Right from the 1980's to the 1990's & to the 2000's, Keaton's range & confidence as a performer has only raised above. And 'Multiplicity' very correctly reaffirms that fact right. 'Multiplicity' Synopsis: A man who never has enough time for the things he wants to do is offered the opportunity to have himself duplicated. 'Multiplicity' is an entertaining film. It runs smoothly & culminates way before it could have doomed. The interesting concept, gets it's due, as it's transferred on-screen efficiently. Harold Ramis's Direction, is fair. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Keaton's performance is truly fantastic in here. He plays 4 characters with great variety & confidence. He is the backbone of this film. Among other performances, Andie MacDowell does well, while Eugene Levy & Harris Yulin lend support. On the whole, If You're A Keaton Fan, well then 'Multiplicity' is your best bet.

    This is not the best comedy ever made, but in all fairness I have to say that I've sat through more than a few comedies and never even cracked a smile. This one on a handful of occasions actually had me laughing out loud, so for that reason alone I have to say it's pretty solid. Michael Keaton is what makes this work so well. It's not just because he's the star - it's that he stars in four roles. It's not a costume comedy, though, which makes his performance all the better. He essentially plays the same character with tweaks and variations to differentiate between them, and he pulls it off brilliantly. Each character is a character of his own, and even the interactions between the characters he plays are pulled off flawlessly so that everything is very natural. The story is tailor made for a comedy revolving around mistaken identity. Keaton's basic character is Doug Kinney, an overworked contractor who's finding that he doesn't have time to keep everything in his life in balance. Hoping for a miracle to help keep his life together he finds himself doing some work for a geneticist who's discovered the secret of "cloning" humans. It's not scientific - the "clones" come out as exact physical replicas rather than as newborn babies with identical genetic material to the original - but this is a comedy, so who cares! It works! Starting with one clone (named, simply, "2") Doug finds that even one copy isn't enough, so he makes another (named, appropriately, "3.") 2 and 3 are completely different from Doug and polar opposites from each other. 2 is a macho, take charge type who happily takes over the contracting business but chafes about having to stay out of sight when he'd much rather be picking up women, while 3 is an effeminate, stay at home type who loves cooking and cleaning. Eventually, 2 and 3 find themselves over-burdened, and they create another clone (named - guess what - "4.") except that 4 is a copy of copy and so, therefore, imperfect, for lack of a better way to put it. Intended to make Doug's life easier, all these 3 clones do is introduce increasing chaos, and at times it is hilarious. Really the only other cast member of note is Andie MacDowell (who teams again with director Harold Ramis as she did in "Groundhog Day") as Doug's increasingly confused wife Laura. Unfortunately, the movie revolves so completely around Doug and the clones that MacDowell, while she was good enough and as always quite lovely, seemed to fade into the background more often than not, so that her talents were generally underused. She's more impressive opposite Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day" than she is here, but that's more a result of the type of movie and the role that it asked of her rather than any deficiency in her performance. This is almost two hours long - which might be a little bit too much for this type of silly comedy. It gets to that length perhaps by trying to introduce too much "drama" (if you will) in the last while about Doug and Laura's faltering marriage. Still, it's a funny movie, and Keaton's performance is worth watching. (7/10)

    A very funny movie. The parts Keaton plays are all different from each other and the movie gets funnier as it goes along unlike other comedies that are played out towards the end. The final clone is a work of art, and how the other "characters" react to it is also hilarious. I watch this movie any time it is on television. There isn't really another movie like it and Keaton's deviation away form harder movies like Pacific Heights shows he's a good actor. There has been a lot of negative reviews here for the film but I can't personally see the problem that a lot of people have with it, it's not meant to be serious and provides great entertainment. Worth a watch.

    This movie is not the best of it's genre, but is definitely a good movie if you are not expecting a great movie.This movie is enjoyable and have some very funny moments.It worth to be seen. Doug Kinney is a man who has many problems.He is very busy with his job and doesn't have much time for his family.In one day at work he meets a man who "saves" him.He is multiplied by this man and now he has much time for his family.His clones replace him at work and now he can stay with his kids, but this is not what he thought to be an easy thing.His clones has the same appearance but different personalities.One is shy, one is serious and one is retarded.It's message is that we all are different.

    One person sells MULTIPLICITY: Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. And Michael Keaton. Keaton is Doug Kinney, so swamped in career and family life that in order to find felicity for himself, he creates a clone to share the burden of domesticity. But one clone turns into two clones turns into three clones the complicity confusing his workmates, his wife (Andie MacDowell), and especially himself. Keaton displays his magnificent multifaceted elasticity by playing every clone with a distinct personality - and never lapses or loses conviction in the four different archetypes. Keaton's performances are so subtle, and work so well against each of himself, that we never notice how stunning his portrayals are; how much blood, sweat and CGI must have gone into learning his lines in a certain character and then playing off three other actors who would eventually be replaced by him - and playing off them four different times as four different types! It is a jaw-dropping performance. Clone Number 1 (whom Doug calls "2") is The Bruce Willis - the masculine side of Doug predominant; "3" is Doug's feminine side predominant; when "2" clones himself to make "4," it's a monkey boy, because "you know how copies of a copy are not as good as the original..." Don't bring analyticity  or it gets disturbing. So the movie never dwells on the cloning process or its moral implications. The only moral authority is Doug's Rule Number One: "No one sleeps with my wife except me!" Of course, one rainy night when Doug "1" is away, that specificity is not simplicity when Doug's wife wants fluidity Keaton is in every single scene, yet because he plays the four personalities so convincingly, when Doug "1" spends so much time offscreen trying to stay on eternal vacation we feel like we're watching three other guys playing Keaton playing Doug! We kick ourselves to remind us it's Keaton on screen IN PERPETUITY. The visual acuity - lighting and sightlines - is 95-percent on target, and as Doug's clones build in their multiplexity, Keaton's synchronicity with his multiplicity is ingenuity incongruity. Directed by Harold Ramis, MULTIPLICITY is bound to be good gratuity from the get-go. Keaton takes it into orbital superfluity. Ably supported by Andie McDowell and her strange accent, reliably confused in all the right places, as is the rest of the cast (Richard Masur, Eugene Levy, Ann Cusack), who feature minimally because Keaton is hogging all the screen time. Message comes through loud and clear - having more of yourself doesn't make life easier, but actually harder; multiplicity breeds instability. There are metaphors on top of metaphors: Doug had to go outside of himself to see himself; in discontinuity, Doug learns continuity; in promiscuity, Doug learns monogamy; in ambiguity, I've lost myself in trying to rhyme everything After "2" clones himself, the real Doug yells without irony, "You can't just go around cloning people!" Doubt anyone else could have pulled off these roles with as much electricity in their authenticity and eccentricity. After all, there's only one Michael Keaton! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

    If you are a fan of Michael Keaton, this is a movie you don't want to miss. The plot revolves around Doug Kinney who has a good life but he is always stressed out at work. That is until a doctor confronts him and tells him that he can clone him. He thinks it's a good idea at first. That is until the clone starts interfering in his relationship with his wife. The movie is very funny. You find yourself laughing from beginning to end like I did. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. It's a very funny movie!
