    it does not matter whether you are a child or an adult, this movie was abysmal! painful for both audiences. if you are over the age of 5 and still enjoying brian levant's movies, then you need help, in fact even if you are 5 years old you still shouldn't watch any movie that is directed by brian levant, he continued his mission to destroy children's cinema, and people seem to like this moron for some bad reason or another. arnold Schwarzenegger is a good actor, but he needs to keep away from films like this, because if he carries on, then he is destroying his own career, in fact every actor (except for the crappy ones) shouldn't say yes to being involved in any brian levant film. overall if you have money if your wallet, and if the only thing to do with that money is to spend it on this terrible film, then throw your money in the rubbish bin, it is better than wasting it on this movie.

    Jingle All the Way is a series of slapstick set pieces melded together around this contorted message that reads something along the lines of: it's better to put others before yourself. Rigid, nostalgic defenders of the film will try to tell you how it's additionally a fantastic comment (indeed, protest) on the materialism and commercialism that surrounds Christmas time as two fathers, along with dozens of others via extras, vie with one another over an action figure toy that's sold out everywhere. Problem is, it isn't about this at all: it's about fully grown men falling over on the snow and ice and hurting themselves; it's about someone as well built as Arnold Schwarzenegger looking silly whilst doing silly things for silly causes. It's a film feeding off the transgressive qualities someone like Schwarzenegger has and the comedic carnage than can ensue when the two binaries inherent with his body and the scenario are meshed together. If the film thinks it has any sort of message at all, then it has such little confidence in its ability to convey that message that it requires one of its characters to, quite literally, shout as loudly as they can the required exposition at the precise moment hosts of screen writing seminars will tell you the setup has ended and the actual meat of it is about to begin. The film actually begins with a production within the production, a mock-action movie set up akin to a Power Rangers episode whereby heroes and villains duel to the end and the heroes triumph. It's all very self-aware, "save the day" stuff as cheesy bad guys are vanquished and good wins, but it resonates in a way that I don't think the makers were perhaps anticipating when the finale of Jingle All the Way itself arrives so as to descend precisely into the very things sent up here. The show is being watched by a certain Jaime Langston (Lloyd), and he observes in awe the might of its lead character: Turbo Man, a red armour with a gold trim-clad super hero whose merchandise in the form of an action figure is the toy every kid wants for the imminent Christmas. Enter his father, Schwarzenegger's Howard  a ruthless business executive whose falsity extends to his telling of every customer with whom he deals down the phone that they're his "number one". At his place of work is the Christmas party, but he chooses to plough on with business suggesting enthusiasm as well as his tendency to shun integration with those he sees every day. Disaster strikes when he stays too long at the office and is bogged down in motorway traffic, thus missing Jaime's karate graduation and has it outlined to him BY his son that on top of everything he's cocked up in the past, this is the final straw. It is amusing to watch the kid sit there, in a bedroom decked out in all this fantastic stuff with toys everywhere, reiterating this to his father through an almighty sulk. He's got everything, but wants more. Hark, for Howard's opportunity at redemption arrives in the form of being able to provide Jaime with a Turbo Man doll on Christmas morning  only, he forgot to buy it the months ago when he should have. Thus, the gauntlet has been laid down and now begins a mad dash around the stores for an edition of it. There is additionally some unpleasant ambiguity involving the Langston's next door neighbour, Ted (Hartman), who is practically everything Howard isn't, and whether Howard is actually out to get the toy for the sake of saving the bond with his son or just to get back at Ted whose already got the toy for HIS kids. It's established Ted has a bit of a way with women, but middle aged widower has eyes only for Howard's wife and with her as angry at Howard as Jaime is, there is a sense that he is at risk of losing her on top of his son's love. The film gets to unleash its funnier content when the two of them are at loggerheads with one another. There exists a sort of unspoken hatred between Howard and Ted; a happy, smiling exterior as they live next door to one another in a pleasant street that gives way to a mean, spiteful rivalry often feeding off the fact Ted is fond of Howard's wife and is domestically superior. The film is mostly just annoying, the set pieces might as well unfold in any order; there are worse things upon which to rely on driving your comedy than farce and slapstick, but the majority of it fails. The "plot" ultimately consists of Schwarzenegger duking it out with a postman who's after one of these dolls for his own son. Black to white; thin and nimble to large and clumsy; white collar to blue, the double act doesn't quite rank amongst the great cinematic comedic pairings. There is a dumb, clumsy energy to the film; something that pulls you along with it during its ridiculous, madcap 90-or-so minute runtime - but there exists nothing to get anybody excited; no scathing statement, no piece of comedy we haven't already seen and nothing really above and beyond the spectacle of a big guy like Schwarzenegger lumped with this big task only to right-royally screw it up.

    Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) is a well meaning but forgetful father. This film follows him as he tries to buy his son a toy for Christmas. The problem is, this toy is a very popular toy, so by the time he gets around to shopping for it (Christmas Eve), he finds it extremely difficult to find a store that has any left in stock. Like me, you may be a fan of the first two Terminator films, The Simpsons and Star Wars. However, don't let the cast fool you. This film certainly isn't either Bill Hartman or Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest hour, but nevertheless, some moments in it are genuinely funny. I found myself watching some scenes, and in my opinion, certain jokes that weren't funny could have been if they were written a bit differently. The really big let down for this film was the ending, as I feel it sort of began to trail off and took us out of the moment we were in. The way it ends does make you feel like the kid had been a bit ungrateful, as he gives the toy (his father at last having found one) that Howard went through quite a lot to get Jamie to the other father. The other father (played by Sinbad) does also go through quite a lot to not only get the Turbo Man toy, but also to snatch it from Jamie (the son), to the point of also endangering both of their lives. The film also includes a little extra after the credits, in which Howard's wife wonders what he has gotten her for Christmas, leaving us with an open ending, and a potential for a sequel (although one doesn't seem to have been made). Overall, I think this was an OK film, but I doubt it will be viewed as a favourite film of all time by anyone, or even best Christmas film ever, particularly if you have seen films such as Elf or It's A Wonderful Life. Don't expect a great film if you decide to watch this. My Rating: See the top of the review.

    Completely brainless fluff with neither a sentiment nor a care in the world. All the pieces are there to revisit the Charlie Brown Christmas Special's message about materialism overpowering the true spirit of the season, but for whatever reason it never even threatens to get to the point. Arnold, in one of his cheesiest roles, (and that's really saying something) breaks laws of more than just a criminal nature in his search for an elusive limited-supply action figure on Christmas Eve. Without exception, every single character in the film is a disdainful, greedy, self-centered jerk with little, if any, redeeming value. Even the matriarch of Arnold's family, long the voice of reason in such pictures, is a judgmental, misguided wasp who graces the screen with perhaps the worst closing line I've heard in years. A pointless exercise that, astonishingly, seems to come to the conclusion that consumerism is good - so long as you buy early.

    Jingle All the Way is one of the most underrated Christmas comedy of all times. Yes, it has a lot of cheesy cartoony scenes, but it's one of the movies that people tend to watch every Christmas. The movie starts Arnold Schwarzenegger as Howard Langston who tends to be late for every family event and struggling really hard to keep all his promises. Trying to make right to his wrongs, he promise his son Jamie (Jake Lloyd) to get a Turbo Man action figure. Jake Lloyd comes out in the movie as little more than reading lines and yelling. The kid actor that will end up to be Anakin Skywalker in future roles, was yelling and promoting materialism in a Christmas movie. Most of his scenes were getting off, or demanding things. It felt that Jamie might have angry problem in the future. Howard Langston thinks this doll will get him in his good side. Only problem is that the Turbo Man action figure is one of the highest top selling toys that year. Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs panics such as Tickle Me Elmo, Power Rangers, Star Wars and Cabbage Patch Kids. Howard goes on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve on search for this doll. He's not alone, as Myron Larabee (Sinbad) a postal worker is also trying to retrieve an action figure for his son. Sinbad gives it his own, as he brings life into Myron. Myron is less than a villain, and more as a good man going to the extreme for his son. Sinbad is a Myron and Howard bumps heads along the way, and getting terrorize by knowing that goody good shoes Ted Maltin (Phil Hartman) is spending more and more time with his wife Liz (Rita Wilson) and child. Phil Hartman is just brilligant in the annoyingly perfect family role. Superdad Ted puts Howard in a bad light. On the way, Howard repeatedly runs into Police Officer Alexander Hummell (Robert Conrad), it's a gag that kinda get old in the end of the film. I know this movie got so much criticism and yeah some of the scenes are just plain silly like a band of counterfeit toy makers lead by Santa (James Belushi) and KQRS Bomb Scare, but also fun and entertaining at the same time making it a blast to watch. This movie came out during the madness of the toy chases of the 1990's. Of course this movie is an example of how crazy black Friday can be, and every parent can related it to. Plus there are plenty of silly scenes for the children to make them laugh as well. Jingle All the Way is sooo stupid, it's brilliant! Hahaha, it's amazing how this film has been hated by so many and loved by many more.﻿It's so silly and memorable, you can't deny that. I can't even eat cookies without thinking of that famous Arnold line. If you going to watch the movie, don't get the Un-Cut version, as the scenes that was cut from the film should have stay on the cutting room floor. They don't really give anything new to the movie. Also the movie soundtrack are mixed up in older DVD and newer DVD versions. So buy a older DVD. After all, if you do like Jingle All The Way and purchase the DVD, Arnold would definitely be happy and would most definitely say "You're my number one customer!".

    It seems to me that a really, really good movie could be made about the holiday shopping rush. So far, though, that really, really good movie hasn't been made. "Jingle All The Way" didn't fill the void. It's Christmas Eve, and Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - who has a habit of letting his family down with broken promises - is suddenly reminded that he was supposed to buy the hottest new toy for his son for Christmas: a Turbo-Man doll; Turbo-Man being the new super-hero craze. Of course, Howard forgot, and now (on the day before Christmas) he has to desperately search for the doll, along with hundreds of others who want the same doll, and especially a mailman (played by Sinbad) who becomes his biggest rival in the quest. This works for a little while. I personally thought that it went way overboard, though. That feeling probably started with the group of black market Santas at the warehouse who hoard cheap versions of hot toys to sell at exorbitant prices. It just seems to go crazy after that. It has some laughs. There's no doubt about that. But it's just too much. Everything seems too forced; too extreme. It's not a bad caricature of the madness of the shopping craze (which I usually associate with Black Friday rather than Christmas Eve) and so it's a reasonable critique of the more negative aspects of the holiday season, and it does make a point at the end that it's family and not the "stuff" that really counts. So it's not a disaster, but I think the whole concept could have been better used. (4/10)

    I'd say 'Jingle all the Way' would be ONLY watchable for children under 4, but even then its incredibly bad messages sent and shameless product placements means it shouldn't be viewed by anyone. And to boot, the actions portrayed mirrors life a little too closely, unfortunately, such as someone macing someone for a Christmas item. Sound familiar? What started off as a family-friendly and touching turned nasty to the core. Or bore. This fits in about when Arnold Schwarzenegger went south and fast. Much like what happened to his state, and eventual life, I suspect. Nevertheless, this should be avoided as is its messages.

    Howard Langston, a salesman for a mattress company is constantly at his job, and also constantly disappoints his son. After he misses his son's karate exposition, he tries hard to come up with a way to make it up to him. His son tells him that what he wants for Christmas is an action figure of Turbo Man. Unfortunately for Howard, it's Christmas Eve, and every store is sold out of Turbo Man. Howard must travel all over town and compete with everybody else including a mail man to find Turbo Man, and to make it to parade... Another one of those movies that was really badly received on initial release, but has gained a little following. I for one think the movie is great, and while it does have some really silly scenes, it keeps the spirit of Christmas going. Schwarzeneggar is having a ball with his movie, and really shows the comic chops he was missing from Junior. But this was released at a time when the star was faltering a little from the A-list, and apart from True Lies and Eraser, he never really recovered. But this movie is a family favourite now, and like several other Christmas movies, it gets viewed every year. It's a fun packed movie for the kids, and it has a great running time, so no one gets bored. Go on, admit you like it, it's Christmas....

    To be blunt, Jingle All The Way is nothing more than it is intended to be: a fun, warm, Christmas-y movie with a good message about being the best father you can be (it also includes a not-so-subtle message about commercialism and fads). And I must say I was pleasantly surprised with Arnie's acting here. As Howard he is actually funny and you do root for him to find a doll. I do agree with some reviewers and posters that the wife and the kid were a bit too harsh with him, but he proves to be the best character by doing what was humanly possible to please his son. Now that the Christmas season is approaching, you can have an excuse to indulge and watch this film. You might just have a lot of fun, just as I did.

    If Arnold Schwarzenegger had not been the lead actor in Jingle All The Way, maybe I would've liked it more. He portrays his character in an awkward, out of place matter and sounds like he inspired Tommy Wiseau's voice in The Room. When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state. Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases. Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his "work is more important than family" attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure. The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House. You follow? Like Stephanie wants this gotta-have-it stuffed bear for Christmas, Jesse, Danny, and Joey try to obtain it on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth when it's out all across town. So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll. The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions. This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless. Maybe next year, Arnold might try his luck with Black Friday. Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, and Sinbad. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    Completely brainless fluff with neither a sentiment nor a care in the world. All the pieces are there to revisit the Charlie Brown Christmas Special's message about materialism overpowering the true spirit of the season, but for whatever reason it never even threatens to get to the point. Arnold, in one of his cheesiest roles, (and that's really saying something) breaks laws of more than just a criminal nature in his search for an elusive limited-supply action figure on Christmas Eve. Without exception, every single character in the film is a disdainful, greedy, self-centered jerk with little, if any, redeeming value. Even the matriarch of Arnold's family, long the voice of reason in such pictures, is a judgmental, misguided wasp who graces the screen with perhaps the worst closing line I've heard in years. A pointless exercise that, astonishingly, seems to come to the conclusion that consumerism is good - so long as you buy early.

    Jingle All the Way is one of the most underrated Christmas comedy of all times. Yes, it has a lot of cheesy cartoony scenes, but it's one of the movies that people tend to watch every Christmas. The movie starts Arnold Schwarzenegger as Howard Langston who tends to be late for every family event and struggling really hard to keep all his promises. Trying to make right to his wrongs, he promise his son Jamie (Jake Lloyd) to get a Turbo Man action figure. Jake Lloyd comes out in the movie as little more than reading lines and yelling. The kid actor that will end up to be Anakin Skywalker in future roles, was yelling and promoting materialism in a Christmas movie. Most of his scenes were getting off, or demanding things. It felt that Jamie might have angry problem in the future. Howard Langston thinks this doll will get him in his good side. Only problem is that the Turbo Man action figure is one of the highest top selling toys that year. Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs panics such as Tickle Me Elmo, Power Rangers, Star Wars and Cabbage Patch Kids. Howard goes on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve on search for this doll. He's not alone, as Myron Larabee (Sinbad) a postal worker is also trying to retrieve an action figure for his son. Sinbad gives it his own, as he brings life into Myron. Myron is less than a villain, and more as a good man going to the extreme for his son. Sinbad is a Myron and Howard bumps heads along the way, and getting terrorize by knowing that goody good shoes Ted Maltin (Phil Hartman) is spending more and more time with his wife Liz (Rita Wilson) and child. Phil Hartman is just brilligant in the annoyingly perfect family role. Superdad Ted puts Howard in a bad light. On the way, Howard repeatedly runs into Police Officer Alexander Hummell (Robert Conrad), it's a gag that kinda get old in the end of the film. I know this movie got so much criticism and yeah some of the scenes are just plain silly like a band of counterfeit toy makers lead by Santa (James Belushi) and KQRS Bomb Scare, but also fun and entertaining at the same time making it a blast to watch. This movie came out during the madness of the toy chases of the 1990's. Of course this movie is an example of how crazy black Friday can be, and every parent can related it to. Plus there are plenty of silly scenes for the children to make them laugh as well. Jingle All the Way is sooo stupid, it's brilliant! Hahaha, it's amazing how this film has been hated by so many and loved by many more.﻿It's so silly and memorable, you can't deny that. I can't even eat cookies without thinking of that famous Arnold line. If you going to watch the movie, don't get the Un-Cut version, as the scenes that was cut from the film should have stay on the cutting room floor. They don't really give anything new to the movie. Also the movie soundtrack are mixed up in older DVD and newer DVD versions. So buy a older DVD. After all, if you do like Jingle All The Way and purchase the DVD, Arnold would definitely be happy and would most definitely say "You're my number one customer!".

    It seems to me that a really, really good movie could be made about the holiday shopping rush. So far, though, that really, really good movie hasn't been made. "Jingle All The Way" didn't fill the void. It's Christmas Eve, and Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - who has a habit of letting his family down with broken promises - is suddenly reminded that he was supposed to buy the hottest new toy for his son for Christmas: a Turbo-Man doll; Turbo-Man being the new super-hero craze. Of course, Howard forgot, and now (on the day before Christmas) he has to desperately search for the doll, along with hundreds of others who want the same doll, and especially a mailman (played by Sinbad) who becomes his biggest rival in the quest. This works for a little while. I personally thought that it went way overboard, though. That feeling probably started with the group of black market Santas at the warehouse who hoard cheap versions of hot toys to sell at exorbitant prices. It just seems to go crazy after that. It has some laughs. There's no doubt about that. But it's just too much. Everything seems too forced; too extreme. It's not a bad caricature of the madness of the shopping craze (which I usually associate with Black Friday rather than Christmas Eve) and so it's a reasonable critique of the more negative aspects of the holiday season, and it does make a point at the end that it's family and not the "stuff" that really counts. So it's not a disaster, but I think the whole concept could have been better used. (4/10)

    I'd say 'Jingle all the Way' would be ONLY watchable for children under 4, but even then its incredibly bad messages sent and shameless product placements means it shouldn't be viewed by anyone. And to boot, the actions portrayed mirrors life a little too closely, unfortunately, such as someone macing someone for a Christmas item. Sound familiar? What started off as a family-friendly and touching turned nasty to the core. Or bore. This fits in about when Arnold Schwarzenegger went south and fast. Much like what happened to his state, and eventual life, I suspect. Nevertheless, this should be avoided as is its messages.

    Howard Langston, a salesman for a mattress company is constantly at his job, and also constantly disappoints his son. After he misses his son's karate exposition, he tries hard to come up with a way to make it up to him. His son tells him that what he wants for Christmas is an action figure of Turbo Man. Unfortunately for Howard, it's Christmas Eve, and every store is sold out of Turbo Man. Howard must travel all over town and compete with everybody else including a mail man to find Turbo Man, and to make it to parade... Another one of those movies that was really badly received on initial release, but has gained a little following. I for one think the movie is great, and while it does have some really silly scenes, it keeps the spirit of Christmas going. Schwarzeneggar is having a ball with his movie, and really shows the comic chops he was missing from Junior. But this was released at a time when the star was faltering a little from the A-list, and apart from True Lies and Eraser, he never really recovered. But this movie is a family favourite now, and like several other Christmas movies, it gets viewed every year. It's a fun packed movie for the kids, and it has a great running time, so no one gets bored. Go on, admit you like it, it's Christmas....

    To be blunt, Jingle All The Way is nothing more than it is intended to be: a fun, warm, Christmas-y movie with a good message about being the best father you can be (it also includes a not-so-subtle message about commercialism and fads). And I must say I was pleasantly surprised with Arnie's acting here. As Howard he is actually funny and you do root for him to find a doll. I do agree with some reviewers and posters that the wife and the kid were a bit too harsh with him, but he proves to be the best character by doing what was humanly possible to please his son. Now that the Christmas season is approaching, you can have an excuse to indulge and watch this film. You might just have a lot of fun, just as I did.

    If Arnold Schwarzenegger had not been the lead actor in Jingle All The Way, maybe I would've liked it more. He portrays his character in an awkward, out of place matter and sounds like he inspired Tommy Wiseau's voice in The Room. When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state. Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases. Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his "work is more important than family" attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure. The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House. You follow? Like Stephanie wants this gotta-have-it stuffed bear for Christmas, Jesse, Danny, and Joey try to obtain it on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth when it's out all across town. So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll. The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions. This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless. Maybe next year, Arnold might try his luck with Black Friday. Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, and Sinbad. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    it does not matter whether you are a child or an adult, this movie was abysmal! painful for both audiences. if you are over the age of 5 and still enjoying brian levant's movies, then you need help, in fact even if you are 5 years old you still shouldn't watch any movie that is directed by brian levant, he continued his mission to destroy children's cinema, and people seem to like this moron for some bad reason or another. arnold Schwarzenegger is a good actor, but he needs to keep away from films like this, because if he carries on, then he is destroying his own career, in fact every actor (except for the crappy ones) shouldn't say yes to being involved in any brian levant film. overall if you have money if your wallet, and if the only thing to do with that money is to spend it on this terrible film, then throw your money in the rubbish bin, it is better than wasting it on this movie.

    Jingle All the Way is a series of slapstick set pieces melded together around this contorted message that reads something along the lines of: it's better to put others before yourself. Rigid, nostalgic defenders of the film will try to tell you how it's additionally a fantastic comment (indeed, protest) on the materialism and commercialism that surrounds Christmas time as two fathers, along with dozens of others via extras, vie with one another over an action figure toy that's sold out everywhere. Problem is, it isn't about this at all: it's about fully grown men falling over on the snow and ice and hurting themselves; it's about someone as well built as Arnold Schwarzenegger looking silly whilst doing silly things for silly causes. It's a film feeding off the transgressive qualities someone like Schwarzenegger has and the comedic carnage than can ensue when the two binaries inherent with his body and the scenario are meshed together. If the film thinks it has any sort of message at all, then it has such little confidence in its ability to convey that message that it requires one of its characters to, quite literally, shout as loudly as they can the required exposition at the precise moment hosts of screen writing seminars will tell you the setup has ended and the actual meat of it is about to begin. The film actually begins with a production within the production, a mock-action movie set up akin to a Power Rangers episode whereby heroes and villains duel to the end and the heroes triumph. It's all very self-aware, "save the day" stuff as cheesy bad guys are vanquished and good wins, but it resonates in a way that I don't think the makers were perhaps anticipating when the finale of Jingle All the Way itself arrives so as to descend precisely into the very things sent up here. The show is being watched by a certain Jaime Langston (Lloyd), and he observes in awe the might of its lead character: Turbo Man, a red armour with a gold trim-clad super hero whose merchandise in the form of an action figure is the toy every kid wants for the imminent Christmas. Enter his father, Schwarzenegger's Howard  a ruthless business executive whose falsity extends to his telling of every customer with whom he deals down the phone that they're his "number one". At his place of work is the Christmas party, but he chooses to plough on with business suggesting enthusiasm as well as his tendency to shun integration with those he sees every day. Disaster strikes when he stays too long at the office and is bogged down in motorway traffic, thus missing Jaime's karate graduation and has it outlined to him BY his son that on top of everything he's cocked up in the past, this is the final straw. It is amusing to watch the kid sit there, in a bedroom decked out in all this fantastic stuff with toys everywhere, reiterating this to his father through an almighty sulk. He's got everything, but wants more. Hark, for Howard's opportunity at redemption arrives in the form of being able to provide Jaime with a Turbo Man doll on Christmas morning  only, he forgot to buy it the months ago when he should have. Thus, the gauntlet has been laid down and now begins a mad dash around the stores for an edition of it. There is additionally some unpleasant ambiguity involving the Langston's next door neighbour, Ted (Hartman), who is practically everything Howard isn't, and whether Howard is actually out to get the toy for the sake of saving the bond with his son or just to get back at Ted whose already got the toy for HIS kids. It's established Ted has a bit of a way with women, but middle aged widower has eyes only for Howard's wife and with her as angry at Howard as Jaime is, there is a sense that he is at risk of losing her on top of his son's love. The film gets to unleash its funnier content when the two of them are at loggerheads with one another. There exists a sort of unspoken hatred between Howard and Ted; a happy, smiling exterior as they live next door to one another in a pleasant street that gives way to a mean, spiteful rivalry often feeding off the fact Ted is fond of Howard's wife and is domestically superior. The film is mostly just annoying, the set pieces might as well unfold in any order; there are worse things upon which to rely on driving your comedy than farce and slapstick, but the majority of it fails. The "plot" ultimately consists of Schwarzenegger duking it out with a postman who's after one of these dolls for his own son. Black to white; thin and nimble to large and clumsy; white collar to blue, the double act doesn't quite rank amongst the great cinematic comedic pairings. There is a dumb, clumsy energy to the film; something that pulls you along with it during its ridiculous, madcap 90-or-so minute runtime - but there exists nothing to get anybody excited; no scathing statement, no piece of comedy we haven't already seen and nothing really above and beyond the spectacle of a big guy like Schwarzenegger lumped with this big task only to right-royally screw it up.

    Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) is a well meaning but forgetful father. This film follows him as he tries to buy his son a toy for Christmas. The problem is, this toy is a very popular toy, so by the time he gets around to shopping for it (Christmas Eve), he finds it extremely difficult to find a store that has any left in stock. Like me, you may be a fan of the first two Terminator films, The Simpsons and Star Wars. However, don't let the cast fool you. This film certainly isn't either Bill Hartman or Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest hour, but nevertheless, some moments in it are genuinely funny. I found myself watching some scenes, and in my opinion, certain jokes that weren't funny could have been if they were written a bit differently. The really big let down for this film was the ending, as I feel it sort of began to trail off and took us out of the moment we were in. The way it ends does make you feel like the kid had been a bit ungrateful, as he gives the toy (his father at last having found one) that Howard went through quite a lot to get Jamie to the other father. The other father (played by Sinbad) does also go through quite a lot to not only get the Turbo Man toy, but also to snatch it from Jamie (the son), to the point of also endangering both of their lives. The film also includes a little extra after the credits, in which Howard's wife wonders what he has gotten her for Christmas, leaving us with an open ending, and a potential for a sequel (although one doesn't seem to have been made). Overall, I think this was an OK film, but I doubt it will be viewed as a favourite film of all time by anyone, or even best Christmas film ever, particularly if you have seen films such as Elf or It's A Wonderful Life. Don't expect a great film if you decide to watch this. My Rating: See the top of the review.

    If Arnold Schwarzenegger had not been the lead actor in Jingle All The Way, maybe I would've liked it more. He portrays his character in an awkward, out of place matter and sounds like he inspired Tommy Wiseau's voice in The Room. When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state. Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases. Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his "work is more important than family" attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure. The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House. You follow? Like Stephanie wants this gotta-have-it stuffed bear for Christmas, Jesse, Danny, and Joey try to obtain it on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth when it's out all across town. So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll. The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions. This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless. Maybe next year, Arnold might try his luck with Black Friday. Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, and Sinbad. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    it does not matter whether you are a child or an adult, this movie was abysmal! painful for both audiences. if you are over the age of 5 and still enjoying brian levant's movies, then you need help, in fact even if you are 5 years old you still shouldn't watch any movie that is directed by brian levant, he continued his mission to destroy children's cinema, and people seem to like this moron for some bad reason or another. arnold Schwarzenegger is a good actor, but he needs to keep away from films like this, because if he carries on, then he is destroying his own career, in fact every actor (except for the crappy ones) shouldn't say yes to being involved in any brian levant film. overall if you have money if your wallet, and if the only thing to do with that money is to spend it on this terrible film, then throw your money in the rubbish bin, it is better than wasting it on this movie.

    Jingle All the Way is a series of slapstick set pieces melded together around this contorted message that reads something along the lines of: it's better to put others before yourself. Rigid, nostalgic defenders of the film will try to tell you how it's additionally a fantastic comment (indeed, protest) on the materialism and commercialism that surrounds Christmas time as two fathers, along with dozens of others via extras, vie with one another over an action figure toy that's sold out everywhere. Problem is, it isn't about this at all: it's about fully grown men falling over on the snow and ice and hurting themselves; it's about someone as well built as Arnold Schwarzenegger looking silly whilst doing silly things for silly causes. It's a film feeding off the transgressive qualities someone like Schwarzenegger has and the comedic carnage than can ensue when the two binaries inherent with his body and the scenario are meshed together. If the film thinks it has any sort of message at all, then it has such little confidence in its ability to convey that message that it requires one of its characters to, quite literally, shout as loudly as they can the required exposition at the precise moment hosts of screen writing seminars will tell you the setup has ended and the actual meat of it is about to begin. The film actually begins with a production within the production, a mock-action movie set up akin to a Power Rangers episode whereby heroes and villains duel to the end and the heroes triumph. It's all very self-aware, "save the day" stuff as cheesy bad guys are vanquished and good wins, but it resonates in a way that I don't think the makers were perhaps anticipating when the finale of Jingle All the Way itself arrives so as to descend precisely into the very things sent up here. The show is being watched by a certain Jaime Langston (Lloyd), and he observes in awe the might of its lead character: Turbo Man, a red armour with a gold trim-clad super hero whose merchandise in the form of an action figure is the toy every kid wants for the imminent Christmas. Enter his father, Schwarzenegger's Howard  a ruthless business executive whose falsity extends to his telling of every customer with whom he deals down the phone that they're his "number one". At his place of work is the Christmas party, but he chooses to plough on with business suggesting enthusiasm as well as his tendency to shun integration with those he sees every day. Disaster strikes when he stays too long at the office and is bogged down in motorway traffic, thus missing Jaime's karate graduation and has it outlined to him BY his son that on top of everything he's cocked up in the past, this is the final straw. It is amusing to watch the kid sit there, in a bedroom decked out in all this fantastic stuff with toys everywhere, reiterating this to his father through an almighty sulk. He's got everything, but wants more. Hark, for Howard's opportunity at redemption arrives in the form of being able to provide Jaime with a Turbo Man doll on Christmas morning  only, he forgot to buy it the months ago when he should have. Thus, the gauntlet has been laid down and now begins a mad dash around the stores for an edition of it. There is additionally some unpleasant ambiguity involving the Langston's next door neighbour, Ted (Hartman), who is practically everything Howard isn't, and whether Howard is actually out to get the toy for the sake of saving the bond with his son or just to get back at Ted whose already got the toy for HIS kids. It's established Ted has a bit of a way with women, but middle aged widower has eyes only for Howard's wife and with her as angry at Howard as Jaime is, there is a sense that he is at risk of losing her on top of his son's love. The film gets to unleash its funnier content when the two of them are at loggerheads with one another. There exists a sort of unspoken hatred between Howard and Ted; a happy, smiling exterior as they live next door to one another in a pleasant street that gives way to a mean, spiteful rivalry often feeding off the fact Ted is fond of Howard's wife and is domestically superior. The film is mostly just annoying, the set pieces might as well unfold in any order; there are worse things upon which to rely on driving your comedy than farce and slapstick, but the majority of it fails. The "plot" ultimately consists of Schwarzenegger duking it out with a postman who's after one of these dolls for his own son. Black to white; thin and nimble to large and clumsy; white collar to blue, the double act doesn't quite rank amongst the great cinematic comedic pairings. There is a dumb, clumsy energy to the film; something that pulls you along with it during its ridiculous, madcap 90-or-so minute runtime - but there exists nothing to get anybody excited; no scathing statement, no piece of comedy we haven't already seen and nothing really above and beyond the spectacle of a big guy like Schwarzenegger lumped with this big task only to right-royally screw it up.

    Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) is a well meaning but forgetful father. This film follows him as he tries to buy his son a toy for Christmas. The problem is, this toy is a very popular toy, so by the time he gets around to shopping for it (Christmas Eve), he finds it extremely difficult to find a store that has any left in stock. Like me, you may be a fan of the first two Terminator films, The Simpsons and Star Wars. However, don't let the cast fool you. This film certainly isn't either Bill Hartman or Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest hour, but nevertheless, some moments in it are genuinely funny. I found myself watching some scenes, and in my opinion, certain jokes that weren't funny could have been if they were written a bit differently. The really big let down for this film was the ending, as I feel it sort of began to trail off and took us out of the moment we were in. The way it ends does make you feel like the kid had been a bit ungrateful, as he gives the toy (his father at last having found one) that Howard went through quite a lot to get Jamie to the other father. The other father (played by Sinbad) does also go through quite a lot to not only get the Turbo Man toy, but also to snatch it from Jamie (the son), to the point of also endangering both of their lives. The film also includes a little extra after the credits, in which Howard's wife wonders what he has gotten her for Christmas, leaving us with an open ending, and a potential for a sequel (although one doesn't seem to have been made). Overall, I think this was an OK film, but I doubt it will be viewed as a favourite film of all time by anyone, or even best Christmas film ever, particularly if you have seen films such as Elf or It's A Wonderful Life. Don't expect a great film if you decide to watch this. My Rating: See the top of the review.

    Completely brainless fluff with neither a sentiment nor a care in the world. All the pieces are there to revisit the Charlie Brown Christmas Special's message about materialism overpowering the true spirit of the season, but for whatever reason it never even threatens to get to the point. Arnold, in one of his cheesiest roles, (and that's really saying something) breaks laws of more than just a criminal nature in his search for an elusive limited-supply action figure on Christmas Eve. Without exception, every single character in the film is a disdainful, greedy, self-centered jerk with little, if any, redeeming value. Even the matriarch of Arnold's family, long the voice of reason in such pictures, is a judgmental, misguided wasp who graces the screen with perhaps the worst closing line I've heard in years. A pointless exercise that, astonishingly, seems to come to the conclusion that consumerism is good - so long as you buy early.

    Jingle All the Way is one of the most underrated Christmas comedy of all times. Yes, it has a lot of cheesy cartoony scenes, but it's one of the movies that people tend to watch every Christmas. The movie starts Arnold Schwarzenegger as Howard Langston who tends to be late for every family event and struggling really hard to keep all his promises. Trying to make right to his wrongs, he promise his son Jamie (Jake Lloyd) to get a Turbo Man action figure. Jake Lloyd comes out in the movie as little more than reading lines and yelling. The kid actor that will end up to be Anakin Skywalker in future roles, was yelling and promoting materialism in a Christmas movie. Most of his scenes were getting off, or demanding things. It felt that Jamie might have angry problem in the future. Howard Langston thinks this doll will get him in his good side. Only problem is that the Turbo Man action figure is one of the highest top selling toys that year. Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs panics such as Tickle Me Elmo, Power Rangers, Star Wars and Cabbage Patch Kids. Howard goes on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve on search for this doll. He's not alone, as Myron Larabee (Sinbad) a postal worker is also trying to retrieve an action figure for his son. Sinbad gives it his own, as he brings life into Myron. Myron is less than a villain, and more as a good man going to the extreme for his son. Sinbad is a Myron and Howard bumps heads along the way, and getting terrorize by knowing that goody good shoes Ted Maltin (Phil Hartman) is spending more and more time with his wife Liz (Rita Wilson) and child. Phil Hartman is just brilligant in the annoyingly perfect family role. Superdad Ted puts Howard in a bad light. On the way, Howard repeatedly runs into Police Officer Alexander Hummell (Robert Conrad), it's a gag that kinda get old in the end of the film. I know this movie got so much criticism and yeah some of the scenes are just plain silly like a band of counterfeit toy makers lead by Santa (James Belushi) and KQRS Bomb Scare, but also fun and entertaining at the same time making it a blast to watch. This movie came out during the madness of the toy chases of the 1990's. Of course this movie is an example of how crazy black Friday can be, and every parent can related it to. Plus there are plenty of silly scenes for the children to make them laugh as well. Jingle All the Way is sooo stupid, it's brilliant! Hahaha, it's amazing how this film has been hated by so many and loved by many more.﻿It's so silly and memorable, you can't deny that. I can't even eat cookies without thinking of that famous Arnold line. If you going to watch the movie, don't get the Un-Cut version, as the scenes that was cut from the film should have stay on the cutting room floor. They don't really give anything new to the movie. Also the movie soundtrack are mixed up in older DVD and newer DVD versions. So buy a older DVD. After all, if you do like Jingle All The Way and purchase the DVD, Arnold would definitely be happy and would most definitely say "You're my number one customer!".

    It seems to me that a really, really good movie could be made about the holiday shopping rush. So far, though, that really, really good movie hasn't been made. "Jingle All The Way" didn't fill the void. It's Christmas Eve, and Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - who has a habit of letting his family down with broken promises - is suddenly reminded that he was supposed to buy the hottest new toy for his son for Christmas: a Turbo-Man doll; Turbo-Man being the new super-hero craze. Of course, Howard forgot, and now (on the day before Christmas) he has to desperately search for the doll, along with hundreds of others who want the same doll, and especially a mailman (played by Sinbad) who becomes his biggest rival in the quest. This works for a little while. I personally thought that it went way overboard, though. That feeling probably started with the group of black market Santas at the warehouse who hoard cheap versions of hot toys to sell at exorbitant prices. It just seems to go crazy after that. It has some laughs. There's no doubt about that. But it's just too much. Everything seems too forced; too extreme. It's not a bad caricature of the madness of the shopping craze (which I usually associate with Black Friday rather than Christmas Eve) and so it's a reasonable critique of the more negative aspects of the holiday season, and it does make a point at the end that it's family and not the "stuff" that really counts. So it's not a disaster, but I think the whole concept could have been better used. (4/10)

    I'd say 'Jingle all the Way' would be ONLY watchable for children under 4, but even then its incredibly bad messages sent and shameless product placements means it shouldn't be viewed by anyone. And to boot, the actions portrayed mirrors life a little too closely, unfortunately, such as someone macing someone for a Christmas item. Sound familiar? What started off as a family-friendly and touching turned nasty to the core. Or bore. This fits in about when Arnold Schwarzenegger went south and fast. Much like what happened to his state, and eventual life, I suspect. Nevertheless, this should be avoided as is its messages.

    Howard Langston, a salesman for a mattress company is constantly at his job, and also constantly disappoints his son. After he misses his son's karate exposition, he tries hard to come up with a way to make it up to him. His son tells him that what he wants for Christmas is an action figure of Turbo Man. Unfortunately for Howard, it's Christmas Eve, and every store is sold out of Turbo Man. Howard must travel all over town and compete with everybody else including a mail man to find Turbo Man, and to make it to parade... Another one of those movies that was really badly received on initial release, but has gained a little following. I for one think the movie is great, and while it does have some really silly scenes, it keeps the spirit of Christmas going. Schwarzeneggar is having a ball with his movie, and really shows the comic chops he was missing from Junior. But this was released at a time when the star was faltering a little from the A-list, and apart from True Lies and Eraser, he never really recovered. But this movie is a family favourite now, and like several other Christmas movies, it gets viewed every year. It's a fun packed movie for the kids, and it has a great running time, so no one gets bored. Go on, admit you like it, it's Christmas....

    To be blunt, Jingle All The Way is nothing more than it is intended to be: a fun, warm, Christmas-y movie with a good message about being the best father you can be (it also includes a not-so-subtle message about commercialism and fads). And I must say I was pleasantly surprised with Arnie's acting here. As Howard he is actually funny and you do root for him to find a doll. I do agree with some reviewers and posters that the wife and the kid were a bit too harsh with him, but he proves to be the best character by doing what was humanly possible to please his son. Now that the Christmas season is approaching, you can have an excuse to indulge and watch this film. You might just have a lot of fun, just as I did.

The film also includes a little extra after the credits, in which Howard's wife wonders what he has gotten her for Christmas, leaving us with an open ending, and a potential for a sequel (although one doesn't seem to have been made). Overall, I think this was an OK film, but I doubt it will be viewed as a favourite film of all time by anyone, or even best Christmas film ever, particularly if you have seen films such as Elf or It's A Wonderful Life. Don't expect a great film if you decide to watch this. My Rating: See the top of the review.

    Completely brainless fluff with neither a sentiment nor a care in the world. All the pieces are there to revisit the Charlie Brown Christmas Special's message about materialism overpowering the true spirit of the season, but for whatever reason it never even threatens to get to the point. Arnold, in one of his cheesiest roles, (and that's really saying something) breaks laws of more than just a criminal nature in his search for an elusive limited-supply action figure on Christmas Eve. Without exception, every single character in the film is a disdainful, greedy, self-centered jerk with little, if any, redeeming value. Even the matriarch of Arnold's family, long the voice of reason in such pictures, is a judgmental, misguided wasp who graces the screen with perhaps the worst closing line I've heard in years. A pointless exercise that, astonishingly, seems to come to the conclusion that consumerism is good - so long as you buy early.

    Jingle All the Way is one of the most underrated Christmas comedy of all times. Yes, it has a lot of cheesy cartoony scenes, but it's one of the movies that people tend to watch every Christmas. The movie starts Arnold Schwarzenegger as Howard Langston who tends to be late for every family event and struggling really hard to keep all his promises. Trying to make right to his wrongs, he promise his son Jamie (Jake Lloyd) to get a Turbo Man action figure. Jake Lloyd comes out in the movie as little more than reading lines and yelling. The kid actor that will end up to be Anakin Skywalker in future roles, was yelling and promoting materialism in a Christmas movie. Most of his scenes were getting off, or demanding things. It felt that Jamie might have angry problem in the future. Howard Langston thinks this doll will get him in his good side. Only problem is that the Turbo Man action figure is one of the highest top selling toys that year. Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs panics such as Tickle Me Elmo, Power Rangers, Star Wars and Cabbage Patch Kids. Howard goes on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve on search for this doll. He's not alone, as Myron Larabee (Sinbad) a postal worker is also trying to retrieve an action figure for his son. Sinbad gives it his own, as he brings life into Myron. Myron is less than a villain, and more as a good man going to the extreme for his son. Sinbad is a Myron and Howard bumps heads along the way, and getting terrorize by knowing that goody good shoes Ted Maltin (Phil Hartman) is spending more and more time with his wife Liz (Rita Wilson) and child. Phil Hartman is just brilligant in the annoyingly perfect family role. Superdad Ted puts Howard in a bad light. On the way, Howard repeatedly runs into Police Officer Alexander Hummell (Robert Conrad), it's a gag that kinda get old in the end of the film. I know this movie got so much criticism and yeah some of the scenes are just plain silly like a band of counterfeit toy makers lead by Santa (James Belushi) and KQRS Bomb Scare, but also fun and entertaining at the same time making it a blast to watch. This movie came out during the madness of the toy chases of the 1990's. Of course this movie is an example of how crazy black Friday can be, and every parent can related it to. Plus there are plenty of silly scenes for the children to make them laugh as well. Jingle All the Way is sooo stupid, it's brilliant! Hahaha, it's amazing how this film has been hated by so many and loved by many more.﻿It's so silly and memorable, you can't deny that. I can't even eat cookies without thinking of that famous Arnold line. If you going to watch the movie, don't get the Un-Cut version, as the scenes that was cut from the film should have stay on the cutting room floor. They don't really give anything new to the movie. Also the movie soundtrack are mixed up in older DVD and newer DVD versions. So buy a older DVD. After all, if you do like Jingle All The Way and purchase the DVD, Arnold would definitely be happy and would most definitely say "You're my number one customer!".

    It seems to me that a really, really good movie could be made about the holiday shopping rush. So far, though, that really, really good movie hasn't been made. "Jingle All The Way" didn't fill the void. It's Christmas Eve, and Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - who has a habit of letting his family down with broken promises - is suddenly reminded that he was supposed to buy the hottest new toy for his son for Christmas: a Turbo-Man doll; Turbo-Man being the new super-hero craze. Of course, Howard forgot, and now (on the day before Christmas) he has to desperately search for the doll, along with hundreds of others who want the same doll, and especially a mailman (played by Sinbad) who becomes his biggest rival in the quest. This works for a little while. I personally thought that it went way overboard, though. That feeling probably started with the group of black market Santas at the warehouse who hoard cheap versions of hot toys to sell at exorbitant prices. It just seems to go crazy after that. It has some laughs. There's no doubt about that. But it's just too much. Everything seems too forced; too extreme. It's not a bad caricature of the madness of the shopping craze (which I usually associate with Black Friday rather than Christmas Eve) and so it's a reasonable critique of the more negative aspects of the holiday season, and it does make a point at the end that it's family and not the "stuff" that really counts. So it's not a disaster, but I think the whole concept could have been better used. (4/10)

    I'd say 'Jingle all the Way' would be ONLY watchable for children under 4, but even then its incredibly bad messages sent and shameless product placements means it shouldn't be viewed by anyone. And to boot, the actions portrayed mirrors life a little too closely, unfortunately, such as someone macing someone for a Christmas item. Sound familiar? What started off as a family-friendly and touching turned nasty to the core. Or bore. This fits in about when Arnold Schwarzenegger went south and fast. Much like what happened to his state, and eventual life, I suspect. Nevertheless, this should be avoided as is its messages.

    Howard Langston, a salesman for a mattress company is constantly at his job, and also constantly disappoints his son. After he misses his son's karate exposition, he tries hard to come up with a way to make it up to him. His son tells him that what he wants for Christmas is an action figure of Turbo Man. Unfortunately for Howard, it's Christmas Eve, and every store is sold out of Turbo Man. Howard must travel all over town and compete with everybody else including a mail man to find Turbo Man, and to make it to parade... Another one of those movies that was really badly received on initial release, but has gained a little following. I for one think the movie is great, and while it does have some really silly scenes, it keeps the spirit of Christmas going. Schwarzeneggar is having a ball with his movie, and really shows the comic chops he was missing from Junior. But this was released at a time when the star was faltering a little from the A-list, and apart from True Lies and Eraser, he never really recovered. But this movie is a family favourite now, and like several other Christmas movies, it gets viewed every year. It's a fun packed movie for the kids, and it has a great running time, so no one gets bored. Go on, admit you like it, it's Christmas....

    To be blunt, Jingle All The Way is nothing more than it is intended to be: a fun, warm, Christmas-y movie with a good message about being the best father you can be (it also includes a not-so-subtle message about commercialism and fads). And I must say I was pleasantly surprised with Arnie's acting here. As Howard he is actually funny and you do root for him to find a doll. I do agree with some reviewers and posters that the wife and the kid were a bit too harsh with him, but he proves to be the best character by doing what was humanly possible to please his son. Now that the Christmas season is approaching, you can have an excuse to indulge and watch this film. You might just have a lot of fun, just as I did.

    If Arnold Schwarzenegger had not been the lead actor in Jingle All The Way, maybe I would've liked it more. He portrays his character in an awkward, out of place matter and sounds like he inspired Tommy Wiseau's voice in The Room. When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state. Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases. Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his "work is more important than family" attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure. The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House. You follow? Like Stephanie wants this gotta-have-it stuffed bear for Christmas, Jesse, Danny, and Joey try to obtain it on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth when it's out all across town. So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll. The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions. This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless. Maybe next year, Arnold might try his luck with Black Friday. Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, and Sinbad. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    it does not matter whether you are a child or an adult, this movie was abysmal! painful for both audiences. if you are over the age of 5 and still enjoying brian levant's movies, then you need help, in fact even if you are 5 years old you still shouldn't watch any movie that is directed by brian levant, he continued his mission to destroy children's cinema, and people seem to like this moron for some bad reason or another. arnold Schwarzenegger is a good actor, but he needs to keep away from films like this, because if he carries on, then he is destroying his own career, in fact every actor (except for the crappy ones) shouldn't say yes to being involved in any brian levant film. overall if you have money if your wallet, and if the only thing to do with that money is to spend it on this terrible film, then throw your money in the rubbish bin, it is better than wasting it on this movie.

    Jingle All the Way is a series of slapstick set pieces melded together around this contorted message that reads something along the lines of: it's better to put others before yourself. Rigid, nostalgic defenders of the film will try to tell you how it's additionally a fantastic comment (indeed, protest) on the materialism and commercialism that surrounds Christmas time as two fathers, along with dozens of others via extras, vie with one another over an action figure toy that's sold out everywhere. Problem is, it isn't about this at all: it's about fully grown men falling over on the snow and ice and hurting themselves; it's about someone as well built as Arnold Schwarzenegger looking silly whilst doing silly things for silly causes. It's a film feeding off the transgressive qualities someone like Schwarzenegger has and the comedic carnage than can ensue when the two binaries inherent with his body and the scenario are meshed together. If the film thinks it has any sort of message at all, then it has such little confidence in its ability to convey that message that it requires one of its characters to, quite literally, shout as loudly as they can the required exposition at the precise moment hosts of screen writing seminars will tell you the setup has ended and the actual meat of it is about to begin. The film actually begins with a production within the production, a mock-action movie set up akin to a Power Rangers episode whereby heroes and villains duel to the end and the heroes triumph. It's all very self-aware, "save the day" stuff as cheesy bad guys are vanquished and good wins, but it resonates in a way that I don't think the makers were perhaps anticipating when the finale of Jingle All the Way itself arrives so as to descend precisely into the very things sent up here. The show is being watched by a certain Jaime Langston (Lloyd), and he observes in awe the might of its lead character: Turbo Man, a red armour with a gold trim-clad super hero whose merchandise in the form of an action figure is the toy every kid wants for the imminent Christmas. Enter his father, Schwarzenegger's Howard  a ruthless business executive whose falsity extends to his telling of every customer with whom he deals down the phone that they're his "number one". At his place of work is the Christmas party, but he chooses to plough on with business suggesting enthusiasm as well as his tendency to shun integration with those he sees every day. Disaster strikes when he stays too long at the office and is bogged down in motorway traffic, thus missing Jaime's karate graduation and has it outlined to him BY his son that on top of everything he's cocked up in the past, this is the final straw. It is amusing to watch the kid sit there, in a bedroom decked out in all this fantastic stuff with toys everywhere, reiterating this to his father through an almighty sulk. He's got everything, but wants more. Hark, for Howard's opportunity at redemption arrives in the form of being able to provide Jaime with a Turbo Man doll on Christmas morning  only, he forgot to buy it the months ago when he should have. Thus, the gauntlet has been laid down and now begins a mad dash around the stores for an edition of it. There is additionally some unpleasant ambiguity involving the Langston's next door neighbour, Ted (Hartman), who is practically everything Howard isn't, and whether Howard is actually out to get the toy for the sake of saving the bond with his son or just to get back at Ted whose already got the toy for HIS kids. It's established Ted has a bit of a way with women, but middle aged widower has eyes only for Howard's wife and with her as angry at Howard as Jaime is, there is a sense that he is at risk of losing her on top of his son's love. The film gets to unleash its funnier content when the two of them are at loggerheads with one another. There exists a sort of unspoken hatred between Howard and Ted; a happy, smiling exterior as they live next door to one another in a pleasant street that gives way to a mean, spiteful rivalry often feeding off the fact Ted is fond of Howard's wife and is domestically superior. The film is mostly just annoying, the set pieces might as well unfold in any order; there are worse things upon which to rely on driving your comedy than farce and slapstick, but the majority of it fails. The "plot" ultimately consists of Schwarzenegger duking it out with a postman who's after one of these dolls for his own son. Black to white; thin and nimble to large and clumsy; white collar to blue, the double act doesn't quite rank amongst the great cinematic comedic pairings. There is a dumb, clumsy energy to the film; something that pulls you along with it during its ridiculous, madcap 90-or-so minute runtime - but there exists nothing to get anybody excited; no scathing statement, no piece of comedy we haven't already seen and nothing really above and beyond the spectacle of a big guy like Schwarzenegger lumped with this big task only to right-royally screw it up.

    Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) is a well meaning but forgetful father. This film follows him as he tries to buy his son a toy for Christmas. The problem is, this toy is a very popular toy, so by the time he gets around to shopping for it (Christmas Eve), he finds it extremely difficult to find a store that has any left in stock. Like me, you may be a fan of the first two Terminator films, The Simpsons and Star Wars. However, don't let the cast fool you. This film certainly isn't either Bill Hartman or Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest hour, but nevertheless, some moments in it are genuinely funny. I found myself watching some scenes, and in my opinion, certain jokes that weren't funny could have been if they were written a bit differently. The really big let down for this film was the ending, as I feel it sort of began to trail off and took us out of the moment we were in. The way it ends does make you feel like the kid had been a bit ungrateful, as he gives the toy (his father at last having found one) that Howard went through quite a lot to get Jamie to the other father. The other father (played by Sinbad) does also go through quite a lot to not only get the Turbo Man toy, but also to snatch it from Jamie (the son), to the point of also endangering both of their lives. The film also includes a little extra after the credits, in which Howard's wife wonders what he has gotten her for Christmas, leaving us with an open ending, and a potential for a sequel (although one doesn't seem to have been made). Overall, I think this was an OK film, but I doubt it will be viewed as a favourite film of all time by anyone, or even best Christmas film ever, particularly if you have seen films such as Elf or It's A Wonderful Life. Don't expect a great film if you decide to watch this. My Rating: See the top of the review.

    To be blunt, Jingle All The Way is nothing more than it is intended to be: a fun, warm, Christmas-y movie with a good message about being the best father you can be (it also includes a not-so-subtle message about commercialism and fads). And I must say I was pleasantly surprised with Arnie's acting here. As Howard he is actually funny and you do root for him to find a doll. I do agree with some reviewers and posters that the wife and the kid were a bit too harsh with him, but he proves to be the best character by doing what was humanly possible to please his son. Now that the Christmas season is approaching, you can have an excuse to indulge and watch this film. You might just have a lot of fun, just as I did.

    If Arnold Schwarzenegger had not been the lead actor in Jingle All The Way, maybe I would've liked it more. He portrays his character in an awkward, out of place matter and sounds like he inspired Tommy Wiseau's voice in The Room. When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state. Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases. Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his "work is more important than family" attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure. The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House. You follow? Like Stephanie wants this gotta-have-it stuffed bear for Christmas, Jesse, Danny, and Joey try to obtain it on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth when it's out all across town. So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll. The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions. This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless. Maybe next year, Arnold might try his luck with Black Friday. Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, and Sinbad. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    it does not matter whether you are a child or an adult, this movie was abysmal! painful for both audiences. if you are over the age of 5 and still enjoying brian levant's movies, then you need help, in fact even if you are 5 years old you still shouldn't watch any movie that is directed by brian levant, he continued his mission to destroy children's cinema, and people seem to like this moron for some bad reason or another. arnold Schwarzenegger is a good actor, but he needs to keep away from films like this, because if he carries on, then he is destroying his own career, in fact every actor (except for the crappy ones) shouldn't say yes to being involved in any brian levant film. overall if you have money if your wallet, and if the only thing to do with that money is to spend it on this terrible film, then throw your money in the rubbish bin, it is better than wasting it on this movie.

    Jingle All the Way is a series of slapstick set pieces melded together around this contorted message that reads something along the lines of: it's better to put others before yourself. Rigid, nostalgic defenders of the film will try to tell you how it's additionally a fantastic comment (indeed, protest) on the materialism and commercialism that surrounds Christmas time as two fathers, along with dozens of others via extras, vie with one another over an action figure toy that's sold out everywhere. Problem is, it isn't about this at all: it's about fully grown men falling over on the snow and ice and hurting themselves; it's about someone as well built as Arnold Schwarzenegger looking silly whilst doing silly things for silly causes. It's a film feeding off the transgressive qualities someone like Schwarzenegger has and the comedic carnage than can ensue when the two binaries inherent with his body and the scenario are meshed together. If the film thinks it has any sort of message at all, then it has such little confidence in its ability to convey that message that it requires one of its characters to, quite literally, shout as loudly as they can the required exposition at the precise moment hosts of screen writing seminars will tell you the setup has ended and the actual meat of it is about to begin. The film actually begins with a production within the production, a mock-action movie set up akin to a Power Rangers episode whereby heroes and villains duel to the end and the heroes triumph. It's all very self-aware, "save the day" stuff as cheesy bad guys are vanquished and good wins, but it resonates in a way that I don't think the makers were perhaps anticipating when the finale of Jingle All the Way itself arrives so as to descend precisely into the very things sent up here. The show is being watched by a certain Jaime Langston (Lloyd), and he observes in awe the might of its lead character: Turbo Man, a red armour with a gold trim-clad super hero whose merchandise in the form of an action figure is the toy every kid wants for the imminent Christmas. Enter his father, Schwarzenegger's Howard  a ruthless business executive whose falsity extends to his telling of every customer with whom he deals down the phone that they're his "number one". At his place of work is the Christmas party, but he chooses to plough on with business suggesting enthusiasm as well as his tendency to shun integration with those he sees every day. Disaster strikes when he stays too long at the office and is bogged down in motorway traffic, thus missing Jaime's karate graduation and has it outlined to him BY his son that on top of everything he's cocked up in the past, this is the final straw. It is amusing to watch the kid sit there, in a bedroom decked out in all this fantastic stuff with toys everywhere, reiterating this to his father through an almighty sulk. He's got everything, but wants more. Hark, for Howard's opportunity at redemption arrives in the form of being able to provide Jaime with a Turbo Man doll on Christmas morning  only, he forgot to buy it the months ago when he should have. Thus, the gauntlet has been laid down and now begins a mad dash around the stores for an edition of it. There is additionally some unpleasant ambiguity involving the Langston's next door neighbour, Ted (Hartman), who is practically everything Howard isn't, and whether Howard is actually out to get the toy for the sake of saving the bond with his son or just to get back at Ted whose already got the toy for HIS kids. It's established Ted has a bit of a way with women, but middle aged widower has eyes only for Howard's wife and with her as angry at Howard as Jaime is, there is a sense that he is at risk of losing her on top of his son's love. The film gets to unleash its funnier content when the two of them are at loggerheads with one another. There exists a sort of unspoken hatred between Howard and Ted; a happy, smiling exterior as they live next door to one another in a pleasant street that gives way to a mean, spiteful rivalry often feeding off the fact Ted is fond of Howard's wife and is domestically superior. The film is mostly just annoying, the set pieces might as well unfold in any order; there are worse things upon which to rely on driving your comedy than farce and slapstick, but the majority of it fails. The "plot" ultimately consists of Schwarzenegger duking it out with a postman who's after one of these dolls for his own son. Black to white; thin and nimble to large and clumsy; white collar to blue, the double act doesn't quite rank amongst the great cinematic comedic pairings. There is a dumb, clumsy energy to the film; something that pulls you along with it during its ridiculous, madcap 90-or-so minute runtime - but there exists nothing to get anybody excited; no scathing statement, no piece of comedy we haven't already seen and nothing really above and beyond the spectacle of a big guy like Schwarzenegger lumped with this big task only to right-royally screw it up.

    Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) is a well meaning but forgetful father. This film follows him as he tries to buy his son a toy for Christmas. The problem is, this toy is a very popular toy, so by the time he gets around to shopping for it (Christmas Eve), he finds it extremely difficult to find a store that has any left in stock. Like me, you may be a fan of the first two Terminator films, The Simpsons and Star Wars. However, don't let the cast fool you. This film certainly isn't either Bill Hartman or Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest hour, but nevertheless, some moments in it are genuinely funny. I found myself watching some scenes, and in my opinion, certain jokes that weren't funny could have been if they were written a bit differently. The really big let down for this film was the ending, as I feel it sort of began to trail off and took us out of the moment we were in. The way it ends does make you feel like the kid had been a bit ungrateful, as he gives the toy (his father at last having found one) that Howard went through quite a lot to get Jamie to the other father. The other father (played by Sinbad) does also go through quite a lot to not only get the Turbo Man toy, but also to snatch it from Jamie (the son), to the point of also endangering both of their lives. The film also includes a little extra after the credits, in which Howard's wife wonders what he has gotten her for Christmas, leaving us with an open ending, and a potential for a sequel (although one doesn't seem to have been made). Overall, I think this was an OK film, but I doubt it will be viewed as a favourite film of all time by anyone, or even best Christmas film ever, particularly if you have seen films such as Elf or It's A Wonderful Life. Don't expect a great film if you decide to watch this. My Rating: See the top of the review.

    Completely brainless fluff with neither a sentiment nor a care in the world. All the pieces are there to revisit the Charlie Brown Christmas Special's message about materialism overpowering the true spirit of the season, but for whatever reason it never even threatens to get to the point. Arnold, in one of his cheesiest roles, (and that's really saying something) breaks laws of more than just a criminal nature in his search for an elusive limited-supply action figure on Christmas Eve. Without exception, every single character in the film is a disdainful, greedy, self-centered jerk with little, if any, redeeming value. Even the matriarch of Arnold's family, long the voice of reason in such pictures, is a judgmental, misguided wasp who graces the screen with perhaps the worst closing line I've heard in years. A pointless exercise that, astonishingly, seems to come to the conclusion that consumerism is good - so long as you buy early.

    Jingle All the Way is one of the most underrated Christmas comedy of all times. Yes, it has a lot of cheesy cartoony scenes, but it's one of the movies that people tend to watch every Christmas. The movie starts Arnold Schwarzenegger as Howard Langston who tends to be late for every family event and struggling really hard to keep all his promises. Trying to make right to his wrongs, he promise his son Jamie (Jake Lloyd) to get a Turbo Man action figure. Jake Lloyd comes out in the movie as little more than reading lines and yelling. The kid actor that will end up to be Anakin Skywalker in future roles, was yelling and promoting materialism in a Christmas movie. Most of his scenes were getting off, or demanding things. It felt that Jamie might have angry problem in the future. Howard Langston thinks this doll will get him in his good side. Only problem is that the Turbo Man action figure is one of the highest top selling toys that year. Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs panics such as Tickle Me Elmo, Power Rangers, Star Wars and Cabbage Patch Kids. Howard goes on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve on search for this doll. He's not alone, as Myron Larabee (Sinbad) a postal worker is also trying to retrieve an action figure for his son. Sinbad gives it his own, as he brings life into Myron. Myron is less than a villain, and more as a good man going to the extreme for his son. Sinbad is a Myron and Howard bumps heads along the way, and getting terrorize by knowing that goody good shoes Ted Maltin (Phil Hartman) is spending more and more time with his wife Liz (Rita Wilson) and child. Phil Hartman is just brilligant in the annoyingly perfect family role. Superdad Ted puts Howard in a bad light. On the way, Howard repeatedly runs into Police Officer Alexander Hummell (Robert Conrad), it's a gag that kinda get old in the end of the film. I know this movie got so much criticism and yeah some of the scenes are just plain silly like a band of counterfeit toy makers lead by Santa (James Belushi) and KQRS Bomb Scare, but also fun and entertaining at the same time making it a blast to watch. This movie came out during the madness of the toy chases of the 1990's. Of course this movie is an example of how crazy black Friday can be, and every parent can related it to. Plus there are plenty of silly scenes for the children to make them laugh as well. Jingle All the Way is sooo stupid, it's brilliant! Hahaha, it's amazing how this film has been hated by so many and loved by many more.﻿It's so silly and memorable, you can't deny that. I can't even eat cookies without thinking of that famous Arnold line. If you going to watch the movie, don't get the Un-Cut version, as the scenes that was cut from the film should have stay on the cutting room floor. They don't really give anything new to the movie. Also the movie soundtrack are mixed up in older DVD and newer DVD versions. So buy a older DVD. After all, if you do like Jingle All The Way and purchase the DVD, Arnold would definitely be happy and would most definitely say "You're my number one customer!".

    It seems to me that a really, really good movie could be made about the holiday shopping rush. So far, though, that really, really good movie hasn't been made. "Jingle All The Way" didn't fill the void. It's Christmas Eve, and Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - who has a habit of letting his family down with broken promises - is suddenly reminded that he was supposed to buy the hottest new toy for his son for Christmas: a Turbo-Man doll; Turbo-Man being the new super-hero craze. Of course, Howard forgot, and now (on the day before Christmas) he has to desperately search for the doll, along with hundreds of others who want the same doll, and especially a mailman (played by Sinbad) who becomes his biggest rival in the quest. This works for a little while. I personally thought that it went way overboard, though. That feeling probably started with the group of black market Santas at the warehouse who hoard cheap versions of hot toys to sell at exorbitant prices. It just seems to go crazy after that. It has some laughs. There's no doubt about that. But it's just too much. Everything seems too forced; too extreme. It's not a bad caricature of the madness of the shopping craze (which I usually associate with Black Friday rather than Christmas Eve) and so it's a reasonable critique of the more negative aspects of the holiday season, and it does make a point at the end that it's family and not the "stuff" that really counts. So it's not a disaster, but I think the whole concept could have been better used. (4/10)

    I'd say 'Jingle all the Way' would be ONLY watchable for children under 4, but even then its incredibly bad messages sent and shameless product placements means it shouldn't be viewed by anyone. And to boot, the actions portrayed mirrors life a little too closely, unfortunately, such as someone macing someone for a Christmas item. Sound familiar? What started off as a family-friendly and touching turned nasty to the core. Or bore. This fits in about when Arnold Schwarzenegger went south and fast. Much like what happened to his state, and eventual life, I suspect. Nevertheless, this should be avoided as is its messages.

    Howard Langston, a salesman for a mattress company is constantly at his job, and also constantly disappoints his son. After he misses his son's karate exposition, he tries hard to come up with a way to make it up to him. His son tells him that what he wants for Christmas is an action figure of Turbo Man. Unfortunately for Howard, it's Christmas Eve, and every store is sold out of Turbo Man. Howard must travel all over town and compete with everybody else including a mail man to find Turbo Man, and to make it to parade... Another one of those movies that was really badly received on initial release, but has gained a little following. I for one think the movie is great, and while it does have some really silly scenes, it keeps the spirit of Christmas going. Schwarzeneggar is having a ball with his movie, and really shows the comic chops he was missing from Junior. But this was released at a time when the star was faltering a little from the A-list, and apart from True Lies and Eraser, he never really recovered. But this movie is a family favourite now, and like several other Christmas movies, it gets viewed every year. It's a fun packed movie for the kids, and it has a great running time, so no one gets bored. Go on, admit you like it, it's Christmas....

The problem is, this toy is a very popular toy, so by the time he gets around to shopping for it (Christmas Eve), he finds it extremely difficult to find a store that has any left in stock. Like me, you may be a fan of the first two Terminator films, The Simpsons and Star Wars. However, don't let the cast fool you. This film certainly isn't either Bill Hartman or Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest hour, but nevertheless, some moments in it are genuinely funny. I found myself watching some scenes, and in my opinion, certain jokes that weren't funny could have been if they were written a bit differently. The really big let down for this film was the ending, as I feel it sort of began to trail off and took us out of the moment we were in. The way it ends does make you feel like the kid had been a bit ungrateful, as he gives the toy (his father at last having found one) that Howard went through quite a lot to get Jamie to the other father. The other father (played by Sinbad) does also go through quite a lot to not only get the Turbo Man toy, but also to snatch it from Jamie (the son), to the point of also endangering both of their lives. The film also includes a little extra after the credits, in which Howard's wife wonders what he has gotten her for Christmas, leaving us with an open ending, and a potential for a sequel (although one doesn't seem to have been made). Overall, I think this was an OK film, but I doubt it will be viewed as a favourite film of all time by anyone, or even best Christmas film ever, particularly if you have seen films such as Elf or It's A Wonderful Life. Don't expect a great film if you decide to watch this. My Rating: See the top of the review.

    Completely brainless fluff with neither a sentiment nor a care in the world. All the pieces are there to revisit the Charlie Brown Christmas Special's message about materialism overpowering the true spirit of the season, but for whatever reason it never even threatens to get to the point. Arnold, in one of his cheesiest roles, (and that's really saying something) breaks laws of more than just a criminal nature in his search for an elusive limited-supply action figure on Christmas Eve. Without exception, every single character in the film is a disdainful, greedy, self-centered jerk with little, if any, redeeming value. Even the matriarch of Arnold's family, long the voice of reason in such pictures, is a judgmental, misguided wasp who graces the screen with perhaps the worst closing line I've heard in years. A pointless exercise that, astonishingly, seems to come to the conclusion that consumerism is good - so long as you buy early.

    Jingle All the Way is one of the most underrated Christmas comedy of all times. Yes, it has a lot of cheesy cartoony scenes, but it's one of the movies that people tend to watch every Christmas. The movie starts Arnold Schwarzenegger as Howard Langston who tends to be late for every family event and struggling really hard to keep all his promises. Trying to make right to his wrongs, he promise his son Jamie (Jake Lloyd) to get a Turbo Man action figure. Jake Lloyd comes out in the movie as little more than reading lines and yelling. The kid actor that will end up to be Anakin Skywalker in future roles, was yelling and promoting materialism in a Christmas movie. Most of his scenes were getting off, or demanding things. It felt that Jamie might have angry problem in the future. Howard Langston thinks this doll will get him in his good side. Only problem is that the Turbo Man action figure is one of the highest top selling toys that year. Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs panics such as Tickle Me Elmo, Power Rangers, Star Wars and Cabbage Patch Kids. Howard goes on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve on search for this doll. He's not alone, as Myron Larabee (Sinbad) a postal worker is also trying to retrieve an action figure for his son. Sinbad gives it his own, as he brings life into Myron. Myron is less than a villain, and more as a good man going to the extreme for his son. Sinbad is a Myron and Howard bumps heads along the way, and getting terrorize by knowing that goody good shoes Ted Maltin (Phil Hartman) is spending more and more time with his wife Liz (Rita Wilson) and child. Phil Hartman is just brilligant in the annoyingly perfect family role. Superdad Ted puts Howard in a bad light. On the way, Howard repeatedly runs into Police Officer Alexander Hummell (Robert Conrad), it's a gag that kinda get old in the end of the film. I know this movie got so much criticism and yeah some of the scenes are just plain silly like a band of counterfeit toy makers lead by Santa (James Belushi) and KQRS Bomb Scare, but also fun and entertaining at the same time making it a blast to watch. This movie came out during the madness of the toy chases of the 1990's. Of course this movie is an example of how crazy black Friday can be, and every parent can related it to. Plus there are plenty of silly scenes for the children to make them laugh as well. Jingle All the Way is sooo stupid, it's brilliant! Hahaha, it's amazing how this film has been hated by so many and loved by many more.﻿It's so silly and memorable, you can't deny that. I can't even eat cookies without thinking of that famous Arnold line. If you going to watch the movie, don't get the Un-Cut version, as the scenes that was cut from the film should have stay on the cutting room floor. They don't really give anything new to the movie. Also the movie soundtrack are mixed up in older DVD and newer DVD versions. So buy a older DVD. After all, if you do like Jingle All The Way and purchase the DVD, Arnold would definitely be happy and would most definitely say "You're my number one customer!".

    It seems to me that a really, really good movie could be made about the holiday shopping rush. So far, though, that really, really good movie hasn't been made. "Jingle All The Way" didn't fill the void. It's Christmas Eve, and Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - who has a habit of letting his family down with broken promises - is suddenly reminded that he was supposed to buy the hottest new toy for his son for Christmas: a Turbo-Man doll; Turbo-Man being the new super-hero craze. Of course, Howard forgot, and now (on the day before Christmas) he has to desperately search for the doll, along with hundreds of others who want the same doll, and especially a mailman (played by Sinbad) who becomes his biggest rival in the quest. This works for a little while. I personally thought that it went way overboard, though. That feeling probably started with the group of black market Santas at the warehouse who hoard cheap versions of hot toys to sell at exorbitant prices. It just seems to go crazy after that. It has some laughs. There's no doubt about that. But it's just too much. Everything seems too forced; too extreme. It's not a bad caricature of the madness of the shopping craze (which I usually associate with Black Friday rather than Christmas Eve) and so it's a reasonable critique of the more negative aspects of the holiday season, and it does make a point at the end that it's family and not the "stuff" that really counts. So it's not a disaster, but I think the whole concept could have been better used. (4/10)

    I'd say 'Jingle all the Way' would be ONLY watchable for children under 4, but even then its incredibly bad messages sent and shameless product placements means it shouldn't be viewed by anyone. And to boot, the actions portrayed mirrors life a little too closely, unfortunately, such as someone macing someone for a Christmas item. Sound familiar? What started off as a family-friendly and touching turned nasty to the core. Or bore. This fits in about when Arnold Schwarzenegger went south and fast. Much like what happened to his state, and eventual life, I suspect. Nevertheless, this should be avoided as is its messages.

    Howard Langston, a salesman for a mattress company is constantly at his job, and also constantly disappoints his son. After he misses his son's karate exposition, he tries hard to come up with a way to make it up to him. His son tells him that what he wants for Christmas is an action figure of Turbo Man. Unfortunately for Howard, it's Christmas Eve, and every store is sold out of Turbo Man. Howard must travel all over town and compete with everybody else including a mail man to find Turbo Man, and to make it to parade... Another one of those movies that was really badly received on initial release, but has gained a little following. I for one think the movie is great, and while it does have some really silly scenes, it keeps the spirit of Christmas going. Schwarzeneggar is having a ball with his movie, and really shows the comic chops he was missing from Junior. But this was released at a time when the star was faltering a little from the A-list, and apart from True Lies and Eraser, he never really recovered. But this movie is a family favourite now, and like several other Christmas movies, it gets viewed every year. It's a fun packed movie for the kids, and it has a great running time, so no one gets bored. Go on, admit you like it, it's Christmas....

    To be blunt, Jingle All The Way is nothing more than it is intended to be: a fun, warm, Christmas-y movie with a good message about being the best father you can be (it also includes a not-so-subtle message about commercialism and fads). And I must say I was pleasantly surprised with Arnie's acting here. As Howard he is actually funny and you do root for him to find a doll. I do agree with some reviewers and posters that the wife and the kid were a bit too harsh with him, but he proves to be the best character by doing what was humanly possible to please his son. Now that the Christmas season is approaching, you can have an excuse to indulge and watch this film. You might just have a lot of fun, just as I did.

    If Arnold Schwarzenegger had not been the lead actor in Jingle All The Way, maybe I would've liked it more. He portrays his character in an awkward, out of place matter and sounds like he inspired Tommy Wiseau's voice in The Room. When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state. Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases. Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his "work is more important than family" attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure. The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House. You follow? Like Stephanie wants this gotta-have-it stuffed bear for Christmas, Jesse, Danny, and Joey try to obtain it on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth when it's out all across town. So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll. The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions. This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless. Maybe next year, Arnold might try his luck with Black Friday. Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, and Sinbad. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    it does not matter whether you are a child or an adult, this movie was abysmal! painful for both audiences. if you are over the age of 5 and still enjoying brian levant's movies, then you need help, in fact even if you are 5 years old you still shouldn't watch any movie that is directed by brian levant, he continued his mission to destroy children's cinema, and people seem to like this moron for some bad reason or another. arnold Schwarzenegger is a good actor, but he needs to keep away from films like this, because if he carries on, then he is destroying his own career, in fact every actor (except for the crappy ones) shouldn't say yes to being involved in any brian levant film. overall if you have money if your wallet, and if the only thing to do with that money is to spend it on this terrible film, then throw your money in the rubbish bin, it is better than wasting it on this movie.

    Jingle All the Way is a series of slapstick set pieces melded together around this contorted message that reads something along the lines of: it's better to put others before yourself. Rigid, nostalgic defenders of the film will try to tell you how it's additionally a fantastic comment (indeed, protest) on the materialism and commercialism that surrounds Christmas time as two fathers, along with dozens of others via extras, vie with one another over an action figure toy that's sold out everywhere. Problem is, it isn't about this at all: it's about fully grown men falling over on the snow and ice and hurting themselves; it's about someone as well built as Arnold Schwarzenegger looking silly whilst doing silly things for silly causes. It's a film feeding off the transgressive qualities someone like Schwarzenegger has and the comedic carnage than can ensue when the two binaries inherent with his body and the scenario are meshed together. If the film thinks it has any sort of message at all, then it has such little confidence in its ability to convey that message that it requires one of its characters to, quite literally, shout as loudly as they can the required exposition at the precise moment hosts of screen writing seminars will tell you the setup has ended and the actual meat of it is about to begin. The film actually begins with a production within the production, a mock-action movie set up akin to a Power Rangers episode whereby heroes and villains duel to the end and the heroes triumph. It's all very self-aware, "save the day" stuff as cheesy bad guys are vanquished and good wins, but it resonates in a way that I don't think the makers were perhaps anticipating when the finale of Jingle All the Way itself arrives so as to descend precisely into the very things sent up here. The show is being watched by a certain Jaime Langston (Lloyd), and he observes in awe the might of its lead character: Turbo Man, a red armour with a gold trim-clad super hero whose merchandise in the form of an action figure is the toy every kid wants for the imminent Christmas. Enter his father, Schwarzenegger's Howard  a ruthless business executive whose falsity extends to his telling of every customer with whom he deals down the phone that they're his "number one". At his place of work is the Christmas party, but he chooses to plough on with business suggesting enthusiasm as well as his tendency to shun integration with those he sees every day. Disaster strikes when he stays too long at the office and is bogged down in motorway traffic, thus missing Jaime's karate graduation and has it outlined to him BY his son that on top of everything he's cocked up in the past, this is the final straw. It is amusing to watch the kid sit there, in a bedroom decked out in all this fantastic stuff with toys everywhere, reiterating this to his father through an almighty sulk. He's got everything, but wants more. Hark, for Howard's opportunity at redemption arrives in the form of being able to provide Jaime with a Turbo Man doll on Christmas morning  only, he forgot to buy it the months ago when he should have. Thus, the gauntlet has been laid down and now begins a mad dash around the stores for an edition of it. There is additionally some unpleasant ambiguity involving the Langston's next door neighbour, Ted (Hartman), who is practically everything Howard isn't, and whether Howard is actually out to get the toy for the sake of saving the bond with his son or just to get back at Ted whose already got the toy for HIS kids. It's established Ted has a bit of a way with women, but middle aged widower has eyes only for Howard's wife and with her as angry at Howard as Jaime is, there is a sense that he is at risk of losing her on top of his son's love. The film gets to unleash its funnier content when the two of them are at loggerheads with one another. There exists a sort of unspoken hatred between Howard and Ted; a happy, smiling exterior as they live next door to one another in a pleasant street that gives way to a mean, spiteful rivalry often feeding off the fact Ted is fond of Howard's wife and is domestically superior. The film is mostly just annoying, the set pieces might as well unfold in any order; there are worse things upon which to rely on driving your comedy than farce and slapstick, but the majority of it fails. The "plot" ultimately consists of Schwarzenegger duking it out with a postman who's after one of these dolls for his own son. Black to white; thin and nimble to large and clumsy; white collar to blue, the double act doesn't quite rank amongst the great cinematic comedic pairings. There is a dumb, clumsy energy to the film; something that pulls you along with it during its ridiculous, madcap 90-or-so minute runtime - but there exists nothing to get anybody excited; no scathing statement, no piece of comedy we haven't already seen and nothing really above and beyond the spectacle of a big guy like Schwarzenegger lumped with this big task only to right-royally screw it up.

But this movie is a family favourite now, and like several other Christmas movies, it gets viewed every year. It's a fun packed movie for the kids, and it has a great running time, so no one gets bored. Go on, admit you like it, it's Christmas....

    To be blunt, Jingle All The Way is nothing more than it is intended to be: a fun, warm, Christmas-y movie with a good message about being the best father you can be (it also includes a not-so-subtle message about commercialism and fads). And I must say I was pleasantly surprised with Arnie's acting here. As Howard he is actually funny and you do root for him to find a doll. I do agree with some reviewers and posters that the wife and the kid were a bit too harsh with him, but he proves to be the best character by doing what was humanly possible to please his son. Now that the Christmas season is approaching, you can have an excuse to indulge and watch this film. You might just have a lot of fun, just as I did.

    If Arnold Schwarzenegger had not been the lead actor in Jingle All The Way, maybe I would've liked it more. He portrays his character in an awkward, out of place matter and sounds like he inspired Tommy Wiseau's voice in The Room. When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state. Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases. Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his "work is more important than family" attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure. The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House. You follow? Like Stephanie wants this gotta-have-it stuffed bear for Christmas, Jesse, Danny, and Joey try to obtain it on the twenty-third or twenty-fourth when it's out all across town. So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll. The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions. This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless. Maybe next year, Arnold might try his luck with Black Friday. Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, and Sinbad. Directed by: Brian Levant.

    it does not matter whether you are a child or an adult, this movie was abysmal! painful for both audiences. if you are over the age of 5 and still enjoying brian levant's movies, then you need help, in fact even if you are 5 years old you still shouldn't watch any movie that is directed by brian levant, he continued his mission to destroy children's cinema, and people seem to like this moron for some bad reason or another. arnold Schwarzenegger is a good actor, but he needs to keep away from films like this, because if he carries on, then he is destroying his own career, in fact every actor (except for the crappy ones) shouldn't say yes to being involved in any brian levant film. overall if you have money if your wallet, and if the only thing to do with that money is to spend it on this terrible film, then throw your money in the rubbish bin, it is better than wasting it on this movie.

    Jingle All the Way is a series of slapstick set pieces melded together around this contorted message that reads something along the lines of: it's better to put others before yourself. Rigid, nostalgic defenders of the film will try to tell you how it's additionally a fantastic comment (indeed, protest) on the materialism and commercialism that surrounds Christmas time as two fathers, along with dozens of others via extras, vie with one another over an action figure toy that's sold out everywhere. Problem is, it isn't about this at all: it's about fully grown men falling over on the snow and ice and hurting themselves; it's about someone as well built as Arnold Schwarzenegger looking silly whilst doing silly things for silly causes. It's a film feeding off the transgressive qualities someone like Schwarzenegger has and the comedic carnage than can ensue when the two binaries inherent with his body and the scenario are meshed together. If the film thinks it has any sort of message at all, then it has such little confidence in its ability to convey that message that it requires one of its characters to, quite literally, shout as loudly as they can the required exposition at the precise moment hosts of screen writing seminars will tell you the setup has ended and the actual meat of it is about to begin. The film actually begins with a production within the production, a mock-action movie set up akin to a Power Rangers episode whereby heroes and villains duel to the end and the heroes triumph. It's all very self-aware, "save the day" stuff as cheesy bad guys are vanquished and good wins, but it resonates in a way that I don't think the makers were perhaps anticipating when the finale of Jingle All the Way itself arrives so as to descend precisely into the very things sent up here. The show is being watched by a certain Jaime Langston (Lloyd), and he observes in awe the might of its lead character: Turbo Man, a red armour with a gold trim-clad super hero whose merchandise in the form of an action figure is the toy every kid wants for the imminent Christmas. Enter his father, Schwarzenegger's Howard  a ruthless business executive whose falsity extends to his telling of every customer with whom he deals down the phone that they're his "number one". At his place of work is the Christmas party, but he chooses to plough on with business suggesting enthusiasm as well as his tendency to shun integration with those he sees every day. Disaster strikes when he stays too long at the office and is bogged down in motorway traffic, thus missing Jaime's karate graduation and has it outlined to him BY his son that on top of everything he's cocked up in the past, this is the final straw. It is amusing to watch the kid sit there, in a bedroom decked out in all this fantastic stuff with toys everywhere, reiterating this to his father through an almighty sulk. He's got everything, but wants more. Hark, for Howard's opportunity at redemption arrives in the form of being able to provide Jaime with a Turbo Man doll on Christmas morning  only, he forgot to buy it the months ago when he should have. Thus, the gauntlet has been laid down and now begins a mad dash around the stores for an edition of it. There is additionally some unpleasant ambiguity involving the Langston's next door neighbour, Ted (Hartman), who is practically everything Howard isn't, and whether Howard is actually out to get the toy for the sake of saving the bond with his son or just to get back at Ted whose already got the toy for HIS kids. It's established Ted has a bit of a way with women, but middle aged widower has eyes only for Howard's wife and with her as angry at Howard as Jaime is, there is a sense that he is at risk of losing her on top of his son's love. The film gets to unleash its funnier content when the two of them are at loggerheads with one another. There exists a sort of unspoken hatred between Howard and Ted; a happy, smiling exterior as they live next door to one another in a pleasant street that gives way to a mean, spiteful rivalry often feeding off the fact Ted is fond of Howard's wife and is domestically superior. The film is mostly just annoying, the set pieces might as well unfold in any order; there are worse things upon which to rely on driving your comedy than farce and slapstick, but the majority of it fails. The "plot" ultimately consists of Schwarzenegger duking it out with a postman who's after one of these dolls for his own son. Black to white; thin and nimble to large and clumsy; white collar to blue, the double act doesn't quite rank amongst the great cinematic comedic pairings. There is a dumb, clumsy energy to the film; something that pulls you along with it during its ridiculous, madcap 90-or-so minute runtime - but there exists nothing to get anybody excited; no scathing statement, no piece of comedy we haven't already seen and nothing really above and beyond the spectacle of a big guy like Schwarzenegger lumped with this big task only to right-royally screw it up.

    Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) is a well meaning but forgetful father. This film follows him as he tries to buy his son a toy for Christmas. The problem is, this toy is a very popular toy, so by the time he gets around to shopping for it (Christmas Eve), he finds it extremely difficult to find a store that has any left in stock. Like me, you may be a fan of the first two Terminator films, The Simpsons and Star Wars. However, don't let the cast fool you. This film certainly isn't either Bill Hartman or Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest hour, but nevertheless, some moments in it are genuinely funny. I found myself watching some scenes, and in my opinion, certain jokes that weren't funny could have been if they were written a bit differently. The really big let down for this film was the ending, as I feel it sort of began to trail off and took us out of the moment we were in. The way it ends does make you feel like the kid had been a bit ungrateful, as he gives the toy (his father at last having found one) that Howard went through quite a lot to get Jamie to the other father. The other father (played by Sinbad) does also go through quite a lot to not only get the Turbo Man toy, but also to snatch it from Jamie (the son), to the point of also endangering both of their lives. The film also includes a little extra after the credits, in which Howard's wife wonders what he has gotten her for Christmas, leaving us with an open ending, and a potential for a sequel (although one doesn't seem to have been made). Overall, I think this was an OK film, but I doubt it will be viewed as a favourite film of all time by anyone, or even best Christmas film ever, particularly if you have seen films such as Elf or It's A Wonderful Life. Don't expect a great film if you decide to watch this. My Rating: See the top of the review.

    Completely brainless fluff with neither a sentiment nor a care in the world. All the pieces are there to revisit the Charlie Brown Christmas Special's message about materialism overpowering the true spirit of the season, but for whatever reason it never even threatens to get to the point. Arnold, in one of his cheesiest roles, (and that's really saying something) breaks laws of more than just a criminal nature in his search for an elusive limited-supply action figure on Christmas Eve. Without exception, every single character in the film is a disdainful, greedy, self-centered jerk with little, if any, redeeming value. Even the matriarch of Arnold's family, long the voice of reason in such pictures, is a judgmental, misguided wasp who graces the screen with perhaps the worst closing line I've heard in years. A pointless exercise that, astonishingly, seems to come to the conclusion that consumerism is good - so long as you buy early.

    Jingle All the Way is one of the most underrated Christmas comedy of all times. Yes, it has a lot of cheesy cartoony scenes, but it's one of the movies that people tend to watch every Christmas. The movie starts Arnold Schwarzenegger as Howard Langston who tends to be late for every family event and struggling really hard to keep all his promises. Trying to make right to his wrongs, he promise his son Jamie (Jake Lloyd) to get a Turbo Man action figure. Jake Lloyd comes out in the movie as little more than reading lines and yelling. The kid actor that will end up to be Anakin Skywalker in future roles, was yelling and promoting materialism in a Christmas movie. Most of his scenes were getting off, or demanding things. It felt that Jamie might have angry problem in the future. Howard Langston thinks this doll will get him in his good side. Only problem is that the Turbo Man action figure is one of the highest top selling toys that year. Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs panics such as Tickle Me Elmo, Power Rangers, Star Wars and Cabbage Patch Kids. Howard goes on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve on search for this doll. He's not alone, as Myron Larabee (Sinbad) a postal worker is also trying to retrieve an action figure for his son. Sinbad gives it his own, as he brings life into Myron. Myron is less than a villain, and more as a good man going to the extreme for his son. Sinbad is a Myron and Howard bumps heads along the way, and getting terrorize by knowing that goody good shoes Ted Maltin (Phil Hartman) is spending more and more time with his wife Liz (Rita Wilson) and child. Phil Hartman is just brilligant in the annoyingly perfect family role. Superdad Ted puts Howard in a bad light. On the way, Howard repeatedly runs into Police Officer Alexander Hummell (Robert Conrad), it's a gag that kinda get old in the end of the film. I know this movie got so much criticism and yeah some of the scenes are just plain silly like a band of counterfeit toy makers lead by Santa (James Belushi) and KQRS Bomb Scare, but also fun and entertaining at the same time making it a blast to watch. This movie came out during the madness of the toy chases of the 1990's. Of course this movie is an example of how crazy black Friday can be, and every parent can related it to. Plus there are plenty of silly scenes for the children to make them laugh as well. Jingle All the Way is sooo stupid, it's brilliant! Hahaha, it's amazing how this film has been hated by so many and loved by many more.﻿It's so silly and memorable, you can't deny that. I can't even eat cookies without thinking of that famous Arnold line. If you going to watch the movie, don't get the Un-Cut version, as the scenes that was cut from the film should have stay on the cutting room floor. They don't really give anything new to the movie. Also the movie soundtrack are mixed up in older DVD and newer DVD versions. So buy a older DVD. After all, if you do like Jingle All The Way and purchase the DVD, Arnold would definitely be happy and would most definitely say "You're my number one customer!".

    It seems to me that a really, really good movie could be made about the holiday shopping rush. So far, though, that really, really good movie hasn't been made. "Jingle All The Way" didn't fill the void. It's Christmas Eve, and Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) - who has a habit of letting his family down with broken promises - is suddenly reminded that he was supposed to buy the hottest new toy for his son for Christmas: a Turbo-Man doll; Turbo-Man being the new super-hero craze. Of course, Howard forgot, and now (on the day before Christmas) he has to desperately search for the doll, along with hundreds of others who want the same doll, and especially a mailman (played by Sinbad) who becomes his biggest rival in the quest. This works for a little while. I personally thought that it went way overboard, though. That feeling probably started with the group of black market Santas at the warehouse who hoard cheap versions of hot toys to sell at exorbitant prices. It just seems to go crazy after that. It has some laughs. There's no doubt about that. But it's just too much. Everything seems too forced; too extreme. It's not a bad caricature of the madness of the shopping craze (which I usually associate with Black Friday rather than Christmas Eve) and so it's a reasonable critique of the more negative aspects of the holiday season, and it does make a point at the end that it's family and not the "stuff" that really counts. So it's not a disaster, but I think the whole concept could have been better used. (4/10)

    I'd say 'Jingle all the Way' would be ONLY watchable for children under 4, but even then its incredibly bad messages sent and shameless product placements means it shouldn't be viewed by anyone. And to boot, the actions portrayed mirrors life a little too closely, unfortunately, such as someone macing someone for a Christmas item. Sound familiar? What started off as a family-friendly and touching turned nasty to the core. Or bore. This fits in about when Arnold Schwarzenegger went south and fast. Much like what happened to his state, and eventual life, I suspect. Nevertheless, this should be avoided as is its messages.

    Howard Langston, a salesman for a mattress company is constantly at his job, and also constantly disappoints his son. After he misses his son's karate exposition, he tries hard to come up with a way to make it up to him. His son tells him that what he wants for Christmas is an action figure of Turbo Man. Unfortunately for Howard, it's Christmas Eve, and every store is sold out of Turbo Man. Howard must travel all over town and compete with everybody else including a mail man to find Turbo Man, and to make it to parade... Another one of those movies that was really badly received on initial release, but has gained a little following. I for one think the movie is great, and while it does have some really silly scenes, it keeps the spirit of Christmas going. Schwarzeneggar is having a ball with his movie, and really shows the comic chops he was missing from Junior. But this was released at a time when the star was faltering a little from the A-list, and apart from True Lies and Eraser, he never really recovered. But this movie is a family favourite now, and like several other Christmas movies, it gets viewed every year. It's a fun packed movie for the kids, and it has a great running time, so no one gets bored. Go on, admit you like it, it's Christmas....
