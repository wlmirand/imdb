 <sinopse>
  A mute woman along with her young daughter, and her prized piano, are sent to 1850s New Zealand for an arranged marriage to a wealthy landowner, and she's soon lusted after by a local worker on the plantation.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  It is the mid-nineteenth century. Ada is a mute who has a young daughter, Flora. In an arranged marriage she leaves her native Scotland accompanied by her daughter and her beloved piano. Life in the rugged forests of New Zealand's South Island is not all she may have imagined and nor is her relationship with her new husband Stewart. She suffers torment and loss when Stewart sells her piano to a neighbour, George. Ada learns from George that she may earn back her piano by giving him piano lessons, but only with certain other conditions attached. At first Ada despises George but slowly their relationship is transformed and this propels them into a dire situation.

    This movie is one where passion gets intertwined with love! The passion for playing a piano and the love for another person. Holly Hunter plays a mute lady who has been playing piano. The narrative at the starting and the end in turn defines this movie and provides it the lens to watch it and grasp it at the end. It is about a widow (Hunter) who gets married to a Sam Neil who plays a landowner in a Maori tribe region. After traveling to distant land with her daughter (young Paquin) she tries to adapt. Her husbands resistance for keeping the piano outside starts her off the wrong track. Harvey ( the plantation worker) who is mystified by her playing the piano tries to provide her with the space to play by requesting Neil to let her teach the piano. As the story progresses, the bond which starts from music grows into love. There are constant doubts raised on part of Harvey, if Hunter loves him or it is just the piano. In between her passion and her growing love lies a story worth exploring. Insecurity (on Neill's part), Passion (Hunter's piano), and Love (Hunter-Harvey) make this plot interesting. What should go without fail is the role of Paquin in her young perception of her mother and her new found father. For all the complexity, I give it a 7 on 10.

    I've seen a lot of terrible comments about this movie, I'd just like to remind to these viewers that a film is made to create an emotion, to make a person's heart jump in it's place. Of course this kind of sensibility may be offensive for some machos but take it easy, the film it's really well achieved and the story is really beautiful to tell and to watch. A woman's point of view always deserve respect, she's a director, if you don't like her work it's because your mentality is from the 19th century and you think she belongs to the kitchen. This is just an advice, in order to enjoy movies an open mind in all matters (like a woman's feelings) will help you a lot and will make your taste for movies what is supposed to be, a pleasure.

    Academy Awards and the notion of Anna Paquin's first movie intrigued meso I didn't hesitate to grab a copy of The Piano I found at a garage sale. However I was surprised and even confused with what I saw. Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) is a mute Scottish widow whose only passion is playing her piano. After her father arranges another marriage for her to a man in New Zealand (Sam Neill), she and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) make the long trip to NZ. Once they get there Ada's new husband Alisdair decides that it's too much work to carry her piano through the muddy woods and difficult terrain to his plantation. Ada is devastated at the idea of her beloved piano rotting on the beach, so her relationship with her new husband is off to a rocky startcomplicated by the fact she can only communicate with him through signs translated by Flora. Luckily Alisdar's bachelor neighbor George (Harvey Keitel) takes pity on Ada and says he will buy her piano and have it delivered to his house. He tells Ada that he will take payment for the piano in the form of music lessons that she will give him in his home. But the catch is that George doesn't really want music lessons from Adahe wants sexual favors. So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus"romance" begins to blossom. You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made. The problem is that the story is awful and Anna Paquin's character was the only one I didn't find despicable at some point. The film left me feeling uncomfortable, confused, and even violated. This is a story that creates extremely uncomfortable situations and evokes uncomfortable emotions in the viewer with little redeeming qualities. On top of that I was very confused about the reason/origin of Ada's muteness, and if she chose not to speak, or physically couldn't. This movie was not a "bad", but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere. And I'd suggest counseling for anyone who truly found this film romantic.

    The Piano is 121 minutes, but it feels like a 3 hour movie. My opinion of this over-rated bunkum, is that it IS over-rated bunkum. I read a few reviews and there are many who feel that this is an art movie. Believe me, this is very far from being art-house. Its that old love triangle, which has been done more times than there are stars in the sky. So, what is it that makes some professional reviewers go weak at the knees after they watch this ? Well there is the voice-over from the mute. A mute talking is so breathtaking...i must give this an extra star. (Thinks the reviewer). It is a grim film to sit through. Just mud and Kiwis..and not a laugh in site. I do concede that the acting and the camera work are both very good, but what we have here is a director who was so intensely trying to make this great---she forgot the fundamentals of movie making. Make it for the public..don't make it for yourself.

    In my opinion a good alternative film stands out because of its emphasis on character development and story line. The Piano fails in both aspects. The film tries to depict a love triangle without providing the necessary background. The location of the story is never explicitated. The viewer is left to derive it must be New Zealand because the indigenous population are called Maoris. The viewer lacks crucial information about the social position and the past of the protagonists and therefore cannot understand their state of mind and motives. How did Ada become mute ? Who fathered little Flora ? Why was Alisdair chosen as her husband ? How did she feel when this arranged marriage was announced to her ? Is Alisdair a rich or important member of the community ? What exactly is his trade ? How and why did he choose Ada for a wife ? Why is he so shy and insecure ? How did Baines end up in New Zealand ? Is he an employee, an associate or simply a neighbour of Alisdair ? Why is he so bitter ? ... To top of the lack of character development the actions and decisions of the protagonists are often completely illogical. Ada has clearly stated to Alisdair how dear the piano is to her. Therefore surely he knows trading the instrument with Baines will hardly win her heart ? Baines seems merely interested in the looks of Ada and manipulates her into sleeping with him. Why does she suddenly fall in love with him ? Why would Flora side with her stepfather against her own mother ? Why does Baines not rush to rescue Ada immediately upon learning her dreadful fate ? ... Finally, the clumsy portrayal of some scenes ads to the frustration of the viewer. Who would manage to cut off just a single digit with an axe when the entire hand is on the block ?! ... In conclusion I find The Piano utterly nonsensical. How a budget was established to shoot this crap let alone how it gathered such critic acclaim is beyond me. There, now anyone opposed can brand me an ignorant sexist ;-) ;-) .

    Agree with others there is not a single character here that is likable or you want to care about. In Hunter, her main character is walled-in and obnoxious to say the least. She made no attempt to relate to anyone except her daughter, then suddenly she's found this great affection for the perverted, scheming Mr.Bain, the neighbor. It was not believable. As for the husband, who for a moment looks like Robert Wagner in a rain hat in an early post, only to revealed to be the inexpressive,aloof Sam Neil whose appearance in any movie is guaranteed flop; maybe the bad attracts the inept. The young daughter is equally repugnant with her own brand of contemptuousness. Lastly director Jane Campion who was New Zealand born, bored a haughty supremacy attitude toward the natives - a third character in this movie. There were no worthy diaglog written for them and they were collectively a servitude with low intel, from the way they were portraited. If Hunter's only expression comes from playing her piano, or so the underlying theme and the title tells us, you'd wonder why there are not more varying pieces? It is the same piece over and over again except one brief underscored occasion. Could Hunter feels the same mood all the time, which appears that way actually with her dour complexion. Overall the film moved too slow, too bleak and without substance for much of the first half. There were genuine moments of importance in the finale but I feel the screen play could have a much better outcome if it is handled better or differently, perhaps with more sensitivity.

    Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin). Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with. Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband. The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making. As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists. Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything. You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like "Training Day" and "Monster's Ball" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in "The Piano" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but "The Piano" gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, "The Piano" is just such a film.

    I have to state that the movie was amazing, but was also one one of the most honest and gut-wrenching films I've seen in a very long time. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mute, brilliant piano mistress who's recently been "sold"/"married" to a man she's never met (Sam Neil) in New Zealand. Ana Paquin as her daughter is wonderful and expressive addition to the cast. The circumstances of Ada's "marriage" and affair are both pitiful and enthralling -- she captivates you with her blank, yet at the same time incredibly deep stare, and the viewer is left wondering what she might be thinking ... not in the frustrating, "I don't understand where this film is going," but in the "how would I act in this situation" sort of way. To that question, there seems to be relatively no answers, except the ones provided on screen. The honesty and sadness, and even the desperate kind of hope or joy expressed in the resolution of the film left me both sick to my stomach, and glad to have seen it. This movie should not be approached by the faint of heart -- it's both so strange and so real, and the graphic / traumatic scenes verge on the deeply unsettling. Well worth seeing, but be warned.

    As a piano historian, I find it amusing that in a film with its plot centred around a Broadwood square piano, nobody bothered to take a moment to check what one should look like. There are plenty of them on the net, but instead, we have this odd-looking object on the beach that is presumably based on trying to justify the other object used inside the house. That, in turn, seems to be a grand piano, with the ends of the keyboard filled in by peculiar wooden blocks, and the tail end hidden through a partition. Where is the historical accuracy, the authenticity that we come to expect in a costume drama like this? If they made equivalent mistakes with costumes, or allowed a plane to fly over the set, people would say it was unacceptable. Does anyone have any answers for me?

    Agree with others there is not a single character here that is likable or you want to care about. In Hunter, her main character is walled-in and obnoxious to say the least. She made no attempt to relate to anyone except her daughter, then suddenly she's found this great affection for the perverted, scheming Mr.Bain, the neighbor. It was not believable. As for the husband, who for a moment looks like Robert Wagner in a rain hat in an early post, only to revealed to be the inexpressive,aloof Sam Neil whose appearance in any movie is guaranteed flop; maybe the bad attracts the inept. The young daughter is equally repugnant with her own brand of contemptuousness. Lastly director Jane Campion who was New Zealand born, bored a haughty supremacy attitude toward the natives - a third character in this movie. There were no worthy diaglog written for them and they were collectively a servitude with low intel, from the way they were portraited. If Hunter's only expression comes from playing her piano, or so the underlying theme and the title tells us, you'd wonder why there are not more varying pieces? It is the same piece over and over again except one brief underscored occasion. Could Hunter feels the same mood all the time, which appears that way actually with her dour complexion. Overall the film moved too slow, too bleak and without substance for much of the first half. There were genuine moments of importance in the finale but I feel the screen play could have a much better outcome if it is handled better or differently, perhaps with more sensitivity.

    Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin). Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with. Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband. The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making. As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists. Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything. You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like "Training Day" and "Monster's Ball" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in "The Piano" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but "The Piano" gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, "The Piano" is just such a film.

    I have to state that the movie was amazing, but was also one one of the most honest and gut-wrenching films I've seen in a very long time. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mute, brilliant piano mistress who's recently been "sold"/"married" to a man she's never met (Sam Neil) in New Zealand. Ana Paquin as her daughter is wonderful and expressive addition to the cast. The circumstances of Ada's "marriage" and affair are both pitiful and enthralling -- she captivates you with her blank, yet at the same time incredibly deep stare, and the viewer is left wondering what she might be thinking ... not in the frustrating, "I don't understand where this film is going," but in the "how would I act in this situation" sort of way. To that question, there seems to be relatively no answers, except the ones provided on screen. The honesty and sadness, and even the desperate kind of hope or joy expressed in the resolution of the film left me both sick to my stomach, and glad to have seen it. This movie should not be approached by the faint of heart -- it's both so strange and so real, and the graphic / traumatic scenes verge on the deeply unsettling. Well worth seeing, but be warned.

    As a piano historian, I find it amusing that in a film with its plot centred around a Broadwood square piano, nobody bothered to take a moment to check what one should look like. There are plenty of them on the net, but instead, we have this odd-looking object on the beach that is presumably based on trying to justify the other object used inside the house. That, in turn, seems to be a grand piano, with the ends of the keyboard filled in by peculiar wooden blocks, and the tail end hidden through a partition. Where is the historical accuracy, the authenticity that we come to expect in a costume drama like this? If they made equivalent mistakes with costumes, or allowed a plane to fly over the set, people would say it was unacceptable. Does anyone have any answers for me?

    This movie is one where passion gets intertwined with love! The passion for playing a piano and the love for another person. Holly Hunter plays a mute lady who has been playing piano. The narrative at the starting and the end in turn defines this movie and provides it the lens to watch it and grasp it at the end. It is about a widow (Hunter) who gets married to a Sam Neil who plays a landowner in a Maori tribe region. After traveling to distant land with her daughter (young Paquin) she tries to adapt. Her husbands resistance for keeping the piano outside starts her off the wrong track. Harvey ( the plantation worker) who is mystified by her playing the piano tries to provide her with the space to play by requesting Neil to let her teach the piano. As the story progresses, the bond which starts from music grows into love. There are constant doubts raised on part of Harvey, if Hunter loves him or it is just the piano. In between her passion and her growing love lies a story worth exploring. Insecurity (on Neill's part), Passion (Hunter's piano), and Love (Hunter-Harvey) make this plot interesting. What should go without fail is the role of Paquin in her young perception of her mother and her new found father. For all the complexity, I give it a 7 on 10.

    I've seen a lot of terrible comments about this movie, I'd just like to remind to these viewers that a film is made to create an emotion, to make a person's heart jump in it's place. Of course this kind of sensibility may be offensive for some machos but take it easy, the film it's really well achieved and the story is really beautiful to tell and to watch. A woman's point of view always deserve respect, she's a director, if you don't like her work it's because your mentality is from the 19th century and you think she belongs to the kitchen. This is just an advice, in order to enjoy movies an open mind in all matters (like a woman's feelings) will help you a lot and will make your taste for movies what is supposed to be, a pleasure.

    Academy Awards and the notion of Anna Paquin's first movie intrigued meso I didn't hesitate to grab a copy of The Piano I found at a garage sale. However I was surprised and even confused with what I saw. Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) is a mute Scottish widow whose only passion is playing her piano. After her father arranges another marriage for her to a man in New Zealand (Sam Neill), she and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) make the long trip to NZ. Once they get there Ada's new husband Alisdair decides that it's too much work to carry her piano through the muddy woods and difficult terrain to his plantation. Ada is devastated at the idea of her beloved piano rotting on the beach, so her relationship with her new husband is off to a rocky startcomplicated by the fact she can only communicate with him through signs translated by Flora. Luckily Alisdar's bachelor neighbor George (Harvey Keitel) takes pity on Ada and says he will buy her piano and have it delivered to his house. He tells Ada that he will take payment for the piano in the form of music lessons that she will give him in his home. But the catch is that George doesn't really want music lessons from Adahe wants sexual favors. So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus"romance" begins to blossom. You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made. The problem is that the story is awful and Anna Paquin's character was the only one I didn't find despicable at some point. The film left me feeling uncomfortable, confused, and even violated. This is a story that creates extremely uncomfortable situations and evokes uncomfortable emotions in the viewer with little redeeming qualities. On top of that I was very confused about the reason/origin of Ada's muteness, and if she chose not to speak, or physically couldn't. This movie was not a "bad", but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere. And I'd suggest counseling for anyone who truly found this film romantic.

    The Piano is 121 minutes, but it feels like a 3 hour movie. My opinion of this over-rated bunkum, is that it IS over-rated bunkum. I read a few reviews and there are many who feel that this is an art movie. Believe me, this is very far from being art-house. Its that old love triangle, which has been done more times than there are stars in the sky. So, what is it that makes some professional reviewers go weak at the knees after they watch this ? Well there is the voice-over from the mute. A mute talking is so breathtaking...i must give this an extra star. (Thinks the reviewer). It is a grim film to sit through. Just mud and Kiwis..and not a laugh in site. I do concede that the acting and the camera work are both very good, but what we have here is a director who was so intensely trying to make this great---she forgot the fundamentals of movie making. Make it for the public..don't make it for yourself.

    In my opinion a good alternative film stands out because of its emphasis on character development and story line. The Piano fails in both aspects. The film tries to depict a love triangle without providing the necessary background. The location of the story is never explicitated. The viewer is left to derive it must be New Zealand because the indigenous population are called Maoris. The viewer lacks crucial information about the social position and the past of the protagonists and therefore cannot understand their state of mind and motives. How did Ada become mute ? Who fathered little Flora ? Why was Alisdair chosen as her husband ? How did she feel when this arranged marriage was announced to her ? Is Alisdair a rich or important member of the community ? What exactly is his trade ? How and why did he choose Ada for a wife ? Why is he so shy and insecure ? How did Baines end up in New Zealand ? Is he an employee, an associate or simply a neighbour of Alisdair ? Why is he so bitter ? ... To top of the lack of character development the actions and decisions of the protagonists are often completely illogical. Ada has clearly stated to Alisdair how dear the piano is to her. Therefore surely he knows trading the instrument with Baines will hardly win her heart ? Baines seems merely interested in the looks of Ada and manipulates her into sleeping with him. Why does she suddenly fall in love with him ? Why would Flora side with her stepfather against her own mother ? Why does Baines not rush to rescue Ada immediately upon learning her dreadful fate ? ... Finally, the clumsy portrayal of some scenes ads to the frustration of the viewer. Who would manage to cut off just a single digit with an axe when the entire hand is on the block ?! ... In conclusion I find The Piano utterly nonsensical. How a budget was established to shoot this crap let alone how it gathered such critic acclaim is beyond me. There, now anyone opposed can brand me an ignorant sexist ;-) ;-) .

What should go without fail is the role of Paquin in her young perception of her mother and her new found father. For all the complexity, I give it a 7 on 10.

    I've seen a lot of terrible comments about this movie, I'd just like to remind to these viewers that a film is made to create an emotion, to make a person's heart jump in it's place. Of course this kind of sensibility may be offensive for some machos but take it easy, the film it's really well achieved and the story is really beautiful to tell and to watch. A woman's point of view always deserve respect, she's a director, if you don't like her work it's because your mentality is from the 19th century and you think she belongs to the kitchen. This is just an advice, in order to enjoy movies an open mind in all matters (like a woman's feelings) will help you a lot and will make your taste for movies what is supposed to be, a pleasure.

    Academy Awards and the notion of Anna Paquin's first movie intrigued meso I didn't hesitate to grab a copy of The Piano I found at a garage sale. However I was surprised and even confused with what I saw. Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) is a mute Scottish widow whose only passion is playing her piano. After her father arranges another marriage for her to a man in New Zealand (Sam Neill), she and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) make the long trip to NZ. Once they get there Ada's new husband Alisdair decides that it's too much work to carry her piano through the muddy woods and difficult terrain to his plantation. Ada is devastated at the idea of her beloved piano rotting on the beach, so her relationship with her new husband is off to a rocky startcomplicated by the fact she can only communicate with him through signs translated by Flora. Luckily Alisdar's bachelor neighbor George (Harvey Keitel) takes pity on Ada and says he will buy her piano and have it delivered to his house. He tells Ada that he will take payment for the piano in the form of music lessons that she will give him in his home. But the catch is that George doesn't really want music lessons from Adahe wants sexual favors. So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus"romance" begins to blossom. You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made. The problem is that the story is awful and Anna Paquin's character was the only one I didn't find despicable at some point. The film left me feeling uncomfortable, confused, and even violated. This is a story that creates extremely uncomfortable situations and evokes uncomfortable emotions in the viewer with little redeeming qualities. On top of that I was very confused about the reason/origin of Ada's muteness, and if she chose not to speak, or physically couldn't. This movie was not a "bad", but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere. And I'd suggest counseling for anyone who truly found this film romantic.

    The Piano is 121 minutes, but it feels like a 3 hour movie. My opinion of this over-rated bunkum, is that it IS over-rated bunkum. I read a few reviews and there are many who feel that this is an art movie. Believe me, this is very far from being art-house. Its that old love triangle, which has been done more times than there are stars in the sky. So, what is it that makes some professional reviewers go weak at the knees after they watch this ? Well there is the voice-over from the mute. A mute talking is so breathtaking...i must give this an extra star. (Thinks the reviewer). It is a grim film to sit through. Just mud and Kiwis..and not a laugh in site. I do concede that the acting and the camera work are both very good, but what we have here is a director who was so intensely trying to make this great---she forgot the fundamentals of movie making. Make it for the public..don't make it for yourself.

    In my opinion a good alternative film stands out because of its emphasis on character development and story line. The Piano fails in both aspects. The film tries to depict a love triangle without providing the necessary background. The location of the story is never explicitated. The viewer is left to derive it must be New Zealand because the indigenous population are called Maoris. The viewer lacks crucial information about the social position and the past of the protagonists and therefore cannot understand their state of mind and motives. How did Ada become mute ? Who fathered little Flora ? Why was Alisdair chosen as her husband ? How did she feel when this arranged marriage was announced to her ? Is Alisdair a rich or important member of the community ? What exactly is his trade ? How and why did he choose Ada for a wife ? Why is he so shy and insecure ? How did Baines end up in New Zealand ? Is he an employee, an associate or simply a neighbour of Alisdair ? Why is he so bitter ? ... To top of the lack of character development the actions and decisions of the protagonists are often completely illogical. Ada has clearly stated to Alisdair how dear the piano is to her. Therefore surely he knows trading the instrument with Baines will hardly win her heart ? Baines seems merely interested in the looks of Ada and manipulates her into sleeping with him. Why does she suddenly fall in love with him ? Why would Flora side with her stepfather against her own mother ? Why does Baines not rush to rescue Ada immediately upon learning her dreadful fate ? ... Finally, the clumsy portrayal of some scenes ads to the frustration of the viewer. Who would manage to cut off just a single digit with an axe when the entire hand is on the block ?! ... In conclusion I find The Piano utterly nonsensical. How a budget was established to shoot this crap let alone how it gathered such critic acclaim is beyond me. There, now anyone opposed can brand me an ignorant sexist ;-) ;-) .

    Agree with others there is not a single character here that is likable or you want to care about. In Hunter, her main character is walled-in and obnoxious to say the least. She made no attempt to relate to anyone except her daughter, then suddenly she's found this great affection for the perverted, scheming Mr.Bain, the neighbor. It was not believable. As for the husband, who for a moment looks like Robert Wagner in a rain hat in an early post, only to revealed to be the inexpressive,aloof Sam Neil whose appearance in any movie is guaranteed flop; maybe the bad attracts the inept. The young daughter is equally repugnant with her own brand of contemptuousness. Lastly director Jane Campion who was New Zealand born, bored a haughty supremacy attitude toward the natives - a third character in this movie. There were no worthy diaglog written for them and they were collectively a servitude with low intel, from the way they were portraited. If Hunter's only expression comes from playing her piano, or so the underlying theme and the title tells us, you'd wonder why there are not more varying pieces? It is the same piece over and over again except one brief underscored occasion. Could Hunter feels the same mood all the time, which appears that way actually with her dour complexion. Overall the film moved too slow, too bleak and without substance for much of the first half. There were genuine moments of importance in the finale but I feel the screen play could have a much better outcome if it is handled better or differently, perhaps with more sensitivity.

    Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin). Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with. Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband. The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making. As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists. Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything. You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like "Training Day" and "Monster's Ball" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in "The Piano" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but "The Piano" gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, "The Piano" is just such a film.

    I have to state that the movie was amazing, but was also one one of the most honest and gut-wrenching films I've seen in a very long time. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mute, brilliant piano mistress who's recently been "sold"/"married" to a man she's never met (Sam Neil) in New Zealand. Ana Paquin as her daughter is wonderful and expressive addition to the cast. The circumstances of Ada's "marriage" and affair are both pitiful and enthralling -- she captivates you with her blank, yet at the same time incredibly deep stare, and the viewer is left wondering what she might be thinking ... not in the frustrating, "I don't understand where this film is going," but in the "how would I act in this situation" sort of way. To that question, there seems to be relatively no answers, except the ones provided on screen. The honesty and sadness, and even the desperate kind of hope or joy expressed in the resolution of the film left me both sick to my stomach, and glad to have seen it. This movie should not be approached by the faint of heart -- it's both so strange and so real, and the graphic / traumatic scenes verge on the deeply unsettling. Well worth seeing, but be warned.

    As a piano historian, I find it amusing that in a film with its plot centred around a Broadwood square piano, nobody bothered to take a moment to check what one should look like. There are plenty of them on the net, but instead, we have this odd-looking object on the beach that is presumably based on trying to justify the other object used inside the house. That, in turn, seems to be a grand piano, with the ends of the keyboard filled in by peculiar wooden blocks, and the tail end hidden through a partition. Where is the historical accuracy, the authenticity that we come to expect in a costume drama like this? If they made equivalent mistakes with costumes, or allowed a plane to fly over the set, people would say it was unacceptable. Does anyone have any answers for me?

    This movie is one where passion gets intertwined with love! The passion for playing a piano and the love for another person. Holly Hunter plays a mute lady who has been playing piano. The narrative at the starting and the end in turn defines this movie and provides it the lens to watch it and grasp it at the end. It is about a widow (Hunter) who gets married to a Sam Neil who plays a landowner in a Maori tribe region. After traveling to distant land with her daughter (young Paquin) she tries to adapt. Her husbands resistance for keeping the piano outside starts her off the wrong track. Harvey ( the plantation worker) who is mystified by her playing the piano tries to provide her with the space to play by requesting Neil to let her teach the piano. As the story progresses, the bond which starts from music grows into love. There are constant doubts raised on part of Harvey, if Hunter loves him or it is just the piano. In between her passion and her growing love lies a story worth exploring. Insecurity (on Neill's part), Passion (Hunter's piano), and Love (Hunter-Harvey) make this plot interesting. What should go without fail is the role of Paquin in her young perception of her mother and her new found father. For all the complexity, I give it a 7 on 10.

Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making. As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists. Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything. You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like "Training Day" and "Monster's Ball" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in "The Piano" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but "The Piano" gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, "The Piano" is just such a film.

    I have to state that the movie was amazing, but was also one one of the most honest and gut-wrenching films I've seen in a very long time. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mute, brilliant piano mistress who's recently been "sold"/"married" to a man she's never met (Sam Neil) in New Zealand. Ana Paquin as her daughter is wonderful and expressive addition to the cast. The circumstances of Ada's "marriage" and affair are both pitiful and enthralling -- she captivates you with her blank, yet at the same time incredibly deep stare, and the viewer is left wondering what she might be thinking ... not in the frustrating, "I don't understand where this film is going," but in the "how would I act in this situation" sort of way. To that question, there seems to be relatively no answers, except the ones provided on screen. The honesty and sadness, and even the desperate kind of hope or joy expressed in the resolution of the film left me both sick to my stomach, and glad to have seen it. This movie should not be approached by the faint of heart -- it's both so strange and so real, and the graphic / traumatic scenes verge on the deeply unsettling. Well worth seeing, but be warned.

    As a piano historian, I find it amusing that in a film with its plot centred around a Broadwood square piano, nobody bothered to take a moment to check what one should look like. There are plenty of them on the net, but instead, we have this odd-looking object on the beach that is presumably based on trying to justify the other object used inside the house. That, in turn, seems to be a grand piano, with the ends of the keyboard filled in by peculiar wooden blocks, and the tail end hidden through a partition. Where is the historical accuracy, the authenticity that we come to expect in a costume drama like this? If they made equivalent mistakes with costumes, or allowed a plane to fly over the set, people would say it was unacceptable. Does anyone have any answers for me?

    This movie is one where passion gets intertwined with love! The passion for playing a piano and the love for another person. Holly Hunter plays a mute lady who has been playing piano. The narrative at the starting and the end in turn defines this movie and provides it the lens to watch it and grasp it at the end. It is about a widow (Hunter) who gets married to a Sam Neil who plays a landowner in a Maori tribe region. After traveling to distant land with her daughter (young Paquin) she tries to adapt. Her husbands resistance for keeping the piano outside starts her off the wrong track. Harvey ( the plantation worker) who is mystified by her playing the piano tries to provide her with the space to play by requesting Neil to let her teach the piano. As the story progresses, the bond which starts from music grows into love. There are constant doubts raised on part of Harvey, if Hunter loves him or it is just the piano. In between her passion and her growing love lies a story worth exploring. Insecurity (on Neill's part), Passion (Hunter's piano), and Love (Hunter-Harvey) make this plot interesting. What should go without fail is the role of Paquin in her young perception of her mother and her new found father. For all the complexity, I give it a 7 on 10.

    I've seen a lot of terrible comments about this movie, I'd just like to remind to these viewers that a film is made to create an emotion, to make a person's heart jump in it's place. Of course this kind of sensibility may be offensive for some machos but take it easy, the film it's really well achieved and the story is really beautiful to tell and to watch. A woman's point of view always deserve respect, she's a director, if you don't like her work it's because your mentality is from the 19th century and you think she belongs to the kitchen. This is just an advice, in order to enjoy movies an open mind in all matters (like a woman's feelings) will help you a lot and will make your taste for movies what is supposed to be, a pleasure.

    Academy Awards and the notion of Anna Paquin's first movie intrigued meso I didn't hesitate to grab a copy of The Piano I found at a garage sale. However I was surprised and even confused with what I saw. Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) is a mute Scottish widow whose only passion is playing her piano. After her father arranges another marriage for her to a man in New Zealand (Sam Neill), she and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) make the long trip to NZ. Once they get there Ada's new husband Alisdair decides that it's too much work to carry her piano through the muddy woods and difficult terrain to his plantation. Ada is devastated at the idea of her beloved piano rotting on the beach, so her relationship with her new husband is off to a rocky startcomplicated by the fact she can only communicate with him through signs translated by Flora. Luckily Alisdar's bachelor neighbor George (Harvey Keitel) takes pity on Ada and says he will buy her piano and have it delivered to his house. He tells Ada that he will take payment for the piano in the form of music lessons that she will give him in his home. But the catch is that George doesn't really want music lessons from Adahe wants sexual favors. So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus"romance" begins to blossom. You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made. The problem is that the story is awful and Anna Paquin's character was the only one I didn't find despicable at some point. The film left me feeling uncomfortable, confused, and even violated. This is a story that creates extremely uncomfortable situations and evokes uncomfortable emotions in the viewer with little redeeming qualities. On top of that I was very confused about the reason/origin of Ada's muteness, and if she chose not to speak, or physically couldn't. This movie was not a "bad", but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere. And I'd suggest counseling for anyone who truly found this film romantic.

    The Piano is 121 minutes, but it feels like a 3 hour movie. My opinion of this over-rated bunkum, is that it IS over-rated bunkum. I read a few reviews and there are many who feel that this is an art movie. Believe me, this is very far from being art-house. Its that old love triangle, which has been done more times than there are stars in the sky. So, what is it that makes some professional reviewers go weak at the knees after they watch this ? Well there is the voice-over from the mute. A mute talking is so breathtaking...i must give this an extra star. (Thinks the reviewer). It is a grim film to sit through. Just mud and Kiwis..and not a laugh in site. I do concede that the acting and the camera work are both very good, but what we have here is a director who was so intensely trying to make this great---she forgot the fundamentals of movie making. Make it for the public..don't make it for yourself.

    In my opinion a good alternative film stands out because of its emphasis on character development and story line. The Piano fails in both aspects. The film tries to depict a love triangle without providing the necessary background. The location of the story is never explicitated. The viewer is left to derive it must be New Zealand because the indigenous population are called Maoris. The viewer lacks crucial information about the social position and the past of the protagonists and therefore cannot understand their state of mind and motives. How did Ada become mute ? Who fathered little Flora ? Why was Alisdair chosen as her husband ? How did she feel when this arranged marriage was announced to her ? Is Alisdair a rich or important member of the community ? What exactly is his trade ? How and why did he choose Ada for a wife ? Why is he so shy and insecure ? How did Baines end up in New Zealand ? Is he an employee, an associate or simply a neighbour of Alisdair ? Why is he so bitter ? ... To top of the lack of character development the actions and decisions of the protagonists are often completely illogical. Ada has clearly stated to Alisdair how dear the piano is to her. Therefore surely he knows trading the instrument with Baines will hardly win her heart ? Baines seems merely interested in the looks of Ada and manipulates her into sleeping with him. Why does she suddenly fall in love with him ? Why would Flora side with her stepfather against her own mother ? Why does Baines not rush to rescue Ada immediately upon learning her dreadful fate ? ... Finally, the clumsy portrayal of some scenes ads to the frustration of the viewer. Who would manage to cut off just a single digit with an axe when the entire hand is on the block ?! ... In conclusion I find The Piano utterly nonsensical. How a budget was established to shoot this crap let alone how it gathered such critic acclaim is beyond me. There, now anyone opposed can brand me an ignorant sexist ;-) ;-) .

    Agree with others there is not a single character here that is likable or you want to care about. In Hunter, her main character is walled-in and obnoxious to say the least. She made no attempt to relate to anyone except her daughter, then suddenly she's found this great affection for the perverted, scheming Mr.Bain, the neighbor. It was not believable. As for the husband, who for a moment looks like Robert Wagner in a rain hat in an early post, only to revealed to be the inexpressive,aloof Sam Neil whose appearance in any movie is guaranteed flop; maybe the bad attracts the inept. The young daughter is equally repugnant with her own brand of contemptuousness. Lastly director Jane Campion who was New Zealand born, bored a haughty supremacy attitude toward the natives - a third character in this movie. There were no worthy diaglog written for them and they were collectively a servitude with low intel, from the way they were portraited. If Hunter's only expression comes from playing her piano, or so the underlying theme and the title tells us, you'd wonder why there are not more varying pieces? It is the same piece over and over again except one brief underscored occasion. Could Hunter feels the same mood all the time, which appears that way actually with her dour complexion. Overall the film moved too slow, too bleak and without substance for much of the first half. There were genuine moments of importance in the finale but I feel the screen play could have a much better outcome if it is handled better or differently, perhaps with more sensitivity.

    Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin). Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with. Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband. The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making. As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy.

So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus"romance" begins to blossom. You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made. The problem is that the story is awful and Anna Paquin's character was the only one I didn't find despicable at some point. The film left me feeling uncomfortable, confused, and even violated. This is a story that creates extremely uncomfortable situations and evokes uncomfortable emotions in the viewer with little redeeming qualities. On top of that I was very confused about the reason/origin of Ada's muteness, and if she chose not to speak, or physically couldn't. This movie was not a "bad", but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere. And I'd suggest counseling for anyone who truly found this film romantic.

    The Piano is 121 minutes, but it feels like a 3 hour movie. My opinion of this over-rated bunkum, is that it IS over-rated bunkum. I read a few reviews and there are many who feel that this is an art movie. Believe me, this is very far from being art-house. Its that old love triangle, which has been done more times than there are stars in the sky. So, what is it that makes some professional reviewers go weak at the knees after they watch this ? Well there is the voice-over from the mute. A mute talking is so breathtaking...i must give this an extra star. (Thinks the reviewer). It is a grim film to sit through. Just mud and Kiwis..and not a laugh in site. I do concede that the acting and the camera work are both very good, but what we have here is a director who was so intensely trying to make this great---she forgot the fundamentals of movie making. Make it for the public..don't make it for yourself.

    In my opinion a good alternative film stands out because of its emphasis on character development and story line. The Piano fails in both aspects. The film tries to depict a love triangle without providing the necessary background. The location of the story is never explicitated. The viewer is left to derive it must be New Zealand because the indigenous population are called Maoris. The viewer lacks crucial information about the social position and the past of the protagonists and therefore cannot understand their state of mind and motives. How did Ada become mute ? Who fathered little Flora ? Why was Alisdair chosen as her husband ? How did she feel when this arranged marriage was announced to her ? Is Alisdair a rich or important member of the community ? What exactly is his trade ? How and why did he choose Ada for a wife ? Why is he so shy and insecure ? How did Baines end up in New Zealand ? Is he an employee, an associate or simply a neighbour of Alisdair ? Why is he so bitter ? ... To top of the lack of character development the actions and decisions of the protagonists are often completely illogical. Ada has clearly stated to Alisdair how dear the piano is to her. Therefore surely he knows trading the instrument with Baines will hardly win her heart ? Baines seems merely interested in the looks of Ada and manipulates her into sleeping with him. Why does she suddenly fall in love with him ? Why would Flora side with her stepfather against her own mother ? Why does Baines not rush to rescue Ada immediately upon learning her dreadful fate ? ... Finally, the clumsy portrayal of some scenes ads to the frustration of the viewer. Who would manage to cut off just a single digit with an axe when the entire hand is on the block ?! ... In conclusion I find The Piano utterly nonsensical. How a budget was established to shoot this crap let alone how it gathered such critic acclaim is beyond me. There, now anyone opposed can brand me an ignorant sexist ;-) ;-) .

    Agree with others there is not a single character here that is likable or you want to care about. In Hunter, her main character is walled-in and obnoxious to say the least. She made no attempt to relate to anyone except her daughter, then suddenly she's found this great affection for the perverted, scheming Mr.Bain, the neighbor. It was not believable. As for the husband, who for a moment looks like Robert Wagner in a rain hat in an early post, only to revealed to be the inexpressive,aloof Sam Neil whose appearance in any movie is guaranteed flop; maybe the bad attracts the inept. The young daughter is equally repugnant with her own brand of contemptuousness. Lastly director Jane Campion who was New Zealand born, bored a haughty supremacy attitude toward the natives - a third character in this movie. There were no worthy diaglog written for them and they were collectively a servitude with low intel, from the way they were portraited. If Hunter's only expression comes from playing her piano, or so the underlying theme and the title tells us, you'd wonder why there are not more varying pieces? It is the same piece over and over again except one brief underscored occasion. Could Hunter feels the same mood all the time, which appears that way actually with her dour complexion. Overall the film moved too slow, too bleak and without substance for much of the first half. There were genuine moments of importance in the finale but I feel the screen play could have a much better outcome if it is handled better or differently, perhaps with more sensitivity.

    Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin). Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with. Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband. The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making. As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists. Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything. You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like "Training Day" and "Monster's Ball" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in "The Piano" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but "The Piano" gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, "The Piano" is just such a film.

    I have to state that the movie was amazing, but was also one one of the most honest and gut-wrenching films I've seen in a very long time. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mute, brilliant piano mistress who's recently been "sold"/"married" to a man she's never met (Sam Neil) in New Zealand. Ana Paquin as her daughter is wonderful and expressive addition to the cast. The circumstances of Ada's "marriage" and affair are both pitiful and enthralling -- she captivates you with her blank, yet at the same time incredibly deep stare, and the viewer is left wondering what she might be thinking ... not in the frustrating, "I don't understand where this film is going," but in the "how would I act in this situation" sort of way. To that question, there seems to be relatively no answers, except the ones provided on screen. The honesty and sadness, and even the desperate kind of hope or joy expressed in the resolution of the film left me both sick to my stomach, and glad to have seen it. This movie should not be approached by the faint of heart -- it's both so strange and so real, and the graphic / traumatic scenes verge on the deeply unsettling. Well worth seeing, but be warned.

    As a piano historian, I find it amusing that in a film with its plot centred around a Broadwood square piano, nobody bothered to take a moment to check what one should look like. There are plenty of them on the net, but instead, we have this odd-looking object on the beach that is presumably based on trying to justify the other object used inside the house. That, in turn, seems to be a grand piano, with the ends of the keyboard filled in by peculiar wooden blocks, and the tail end hidden through a partition. Where is the historical accuracy, the authenticity that we come to expect in a costume drama like this? If they made equivalent mistakes with costumes, or allowed a plane to fly over the set, people would say it was unacceptable. Does anyone have any answers for me?

    This movie is one where passion gets intertwined with love! The passion for playing a piano and the love for another person. Holly Hunter plays a mute lady who has been playing piano. The narrative at the starting and the end in turn defines this movie and provides it the lens to watch it and grasp it at the end. It is about a widow (Hunter) who gets married to a Sam Neil who plays a landowner in a Maori tribe region. After traveling to distant land with her daughter (young Paquin) she tries to adapt. Her husbands resistance for keeping the piano outside starts her off the wrong track. Harvey ( the plantation worker) who is mystified by her playing the piano tries to provide her with the space to play by requesting Neil to let her teach the piano. As the story progresses, the bond which starts from music grows into love. There are constant doubts raised on part of Harvey, if Hunter loves him or it is just the piano. In between her passion and her growing love lies a story worth exploring. Insecurity (on Neill's part), Passion (Hunter's piano), and Love (Hunter-Harvey) make this plot interesting. What should go without fail is the role of Paquin in her young perception of her mother and her new found father. For all the complexity, I give it a 7 on 10.

    I've seen a lot of terrible comments about this movie, I'd just like to remind to these viewers that a film is made to create an emotion, to make a person's heart jump in it's place. Of course this kind of sensibility may be offensive for some machos but take it easy, the film it's really well achieved and the story is really beautiful to tell and to watch. A woman's point of view always deserve respect, she's a director, if you don't like her work it's because your mentality is from the 19th century and you think she belongs to the kitchen. This is just an advice, in order to enjoy movies an open mind in all matters (like a woman's feelings) will help you a lot and will make your taste for movies what is supposed to be, a pleasure.

    Academy Awards and the notion of Anna Paquin's first movie intrigued meso I didn't hesitate to grab a copy of The Piano I found at a garage sale. However I was surprised and even confused with what I saw. Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) is a mute Scottish widow whose only passion is playing her piano. After her father arranges another marriage for her to a man in New Zealand (Sam Neill), she and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) make the long trip to NZ. Once they get there Ada's new husband Alisdair decides that it's too much work to carry her piano through the muddy woods and difficult terrain to his plantation. Ada is devastated at the idea of her beloved piano rotting on the beach, so her relationship with her new husband is off to a rocky startcomplicated by the fact she can only communicate with him through signs translated by Flora. Luckily Alisdar's bachelor neighbor George (Harvey Keitel) takes pity on Ada and says he will buy her piano and have it delivered to his house. He tells Ada that he will take payment for the piano in the form of music lessons that she will give him in his home. But the catch is that George doesn't really want music lessons from Adahe wants sexual favors. So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus"romance" begins to blossom. You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made.

This movie was not a "bad", but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere.

You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like "Training Day" and "Monster's Ball" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in "The Piano" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but "The Piano" gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, "The Piano" is just such a film.

    I have to state that the movie was amazing, but was also one one of the most honest and gut-wrenching films I've seen in a very long time. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mute, brilliant piano mistress who's recently been "sold"/"married" to a man she's never met (Sam Neil) in New Zealand. Ana Paquin as her daughter is wonderful and expressive addition to the cast. The circumstances of Ada's "marriage" and affair are both pitiful and enthralling -- she captivates you with her blank, yet at the same time incredibly deep stare, and the viewer is left wondering what she might be thinking ... not in the frustrating, "I don't understand where this film is going," but in the "how would I act in this situation" sort of way. To that question, there seems to be relatively no answers, except the ones provided on screen. The honesty and sadness, and even the desperate kind of hope or joy expressed in the resolution of the film left me both sick to my stomach, and glad to have seen it. This movie should not be approached by the faint of heart -- it's both so strange and so real, and the graphic / traumatic scenes verge on the deeply unsettling. Well worth seeing, but be warned.

    As a piano historian, I find it amusing that in a film with its plot centred around a Broadwood square piano, nobody bothered to take a moment to check what one should look like. There are plenty of them on the net, but instead, we have this odd-looking object on the beach that is presumably based on trying to justify the other object used inside the house. That, in turn, seems to be a grand piano, with the ends of the keyboard filled in by peculiar wooden blocks, and the tail end hidden through a partition. Where is the historical accuracy, the authenticity that we come to expect in a costume drama like this? If they made equivalent mistakes with costumes, or allowed a plane to fly over the set, people would say it was unacceptable. Does anyone have any answers for me?

    This movie is one where passion gets intertwined with love! The passion for playing a piano and the love for another person. Holly Hunter plays a mute lady who has been playing piano. The narrative at the starting and the end in turn defines this movie and provides it the lens to watch it and grasp it at the end. It is about a widow (Hunter) who gets married to a Sam Neil who plays a landowner in a Maori tribe region. After traveling to distant land with her daughter (young Paquin) she tries to adapt. Her husbands resistance for keeping the piano outside starts her off the wrong track. Harvey ( the plantation worker) who is mystified by her playing the piano tries to provide her with the space to play by requesting Neil to let her teach the piano. As the story progresses, the bond which starts from music grows into love. There are constant doubts raised on part of Harvey, if Hunter loves him or it is just the piano. In between her passion and her growing love lies a story worth exploring. Insecurity (on Neill's part), Passion (Hunter's piano), and Love (Hunter-Harvey) make this plot interesting. What should go without fail is the role of Paquin in her young perception of her mother and her new found father. For all the complexity, I give it a 7 on 10.

    I've seen a lot of terrible comments about this movie, I'd just like to remind to these viewers that a film is made to create an emotion, to make a person's heart jump in it's place. Of course this kind of sensibility may be offensive for some machos but take it easy, the film it's really well achieved and the story is really beautiful to tell and to watch. A woman's point of view always deserve respect, she's a director, if you don't like her work it's because your mentality is from the 19th century and you think she belongs to the kitchen. This is just an advice, in order to enjoy movies an open mind in all matters (like a woman's feelings) will help you a lot and will make your taste for movies what is supposed to be, a pleasure.

    Academy Awards and the notion of Anna Paquin's first movie intrigued meso I didn't hesitate to grab a copy of The Piano I found at a garage sale. However I was surprised and even confused with what I saw. Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) is a mute Scottish widow whose only passion is playing her piano. After her father arranges another marriage for her to a man in New Zealand (Sam Neill), she and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) make the long trip to NZ. Once they get there Ada's new husband Alisdair decides that it's too much work to carry her piano through the muddy woods and difficult terrain to his plantation. Ada is devastated at the idea of her beloved piano rotting on the beach, so her relationship with her new husband is off to a rocky startcomplicated by the fact she can only communicate with him through signs translated by Flora. Luckily Alisdar's bachelor neighbor George (Harvey Keitel) takes pity on Ada and says he will buy her piano and have it delivered to his house. He tells Ada that he will take payment for the piano in the form of music lessons that she will give him in his home. But the catch is that George doesn't really want music lessons from Adahe wants sexual favors. So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus"romance" begins to blossom. You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made. The problem is that the story is awful and Anna Paquin's character was the only one I didn't find despicable at some point. The film left me feeling uncomfortable, confused, and even violated. This is a story that creates extremely uncomfortable situations and evokes uncomfortable emotions in the viewer with little redeeming qualities. On top of that I was very confused about the reason/origin of Ada's muteness, and if she chose not to speak, or physically couldn't. This movie was not a "bad", but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere. And I'd suggest counseling for anyone who truly found this film romantic.

    The Piano is 121 minutes, but it feels like a 3 hour movie. My opinion of this over-rated bunkum, is that it IS over-rated bunkum. I read a few reviews and there are many who feel that this is an art movie. Believe me, this is very far from being art-house. Its that old love triangle, which has been done more times than there are stars in the sky. So, what is it that makes some professional reviewers go weak at the knees after they watch this ? Well there is the voice-over from the mute. A mute talking is so breathtaking...i must give this an extra star. (Thinks the reviewer). It is a grim film to sit through. Just mud and Kiwis..and not a laugh in site. I do concede that the acting and the camera work are both very good, but what we have here is a director who was so intensely trying to make this great---she forgot the fundamentals of movie making. Make it for the public..don't make it for yourself.

    In my opinion a good alternative film stands out because of its emphasis on character development and story line. The Piano fails in both aspects. The film tries to depict a love triangle without providing the necessary background. The location of the story is never explicitated. The viewer is left to derive it must be New Zealand because the indigenous population are called Maoris. The viewer lacks crucial information about the social position and the past of the protagonists and therefore cannot understand their state of mind and motives. How did Ada become mute ? Who fathered little Flora ? Why was Alisdair chosen as her husband ? How did she feel when this arranged marriage was announced to her ? Is Alisdair a rich or important member of the community ? What exactly is his trade ? How and why did he choose Ada for a wife ? Why is he so shy and insecure ? How did Baines end up in New Zealand ? Is he an employee, an associate or simply a neighbour of Alisdair ? Why is he so bitter ? ... To top of the lack of character development the actions and decisions of the protagonists are often completely illogical. Ada has clearly stated to Alisdair how dear the piano is to her. Therefore surely he knows trading the instrument with Baines will hardly win her heart ? Baines seems merely interested in the looks of Ada and manipulates her into sleeping with him. Why does she suddenly fall in love with him ? Why would Flora side with her stepfather against her own mother ? Why does Baines not rush to rescue Ada immediately upon learning her dreadful fate ? ... Finally, the clumsy portrayal of some scenes ads to the frustration of the viewer. Who would manage to cut off just a single digit with an axe when the entire hand is on the block ?! ... In conclusion I find The Piano utterly nonsensical. How a budget was established to shoot this crap let alone how it gathered such critic acclaim is beyond me. There, now anyone opposed can brand me an ignorant sexist ;-) ;-) .

    Agree with others there is not a single character here that is likable or you want to care about. In Hunter, her main character is walled-in and obnoxious to say the least. She made no attempt to relate to anyone except her daughter, then suddenly she's found this great affection for the perverted, scheming Mr.Bain, the neighbor. It was not believable. As for the husband, who for a moment looks like Robert Wagner in a rain hat in an early post, only to revealed to be the inexpressive,aloof Sam Neil whose appearance in any movie is guaranteed flop; maybe the bad attracts the inept. The young daughter is equally repugnant with her own brand of contemptuousness. Lastly director Jane Campion who was New Zealand born, bored a haughty supremacy attitude toward the natives - a third character in this movie. There were no worthy diaglog written for them and they were collectively a servitude with low intel, from the way they were portraited. If Hunter's only expression comes from playing her piano, or so the underlying theme and the title tells us, you'd wonder why there are not more varying pieces? It is the same piece over and over again except one brief underscored occasion. Could Hunter feels the same mood all the time, which appears that way actually with her dour complexion. Overall the film moved too slow, too bleak and without substance for much of the first half. There were genuine moments of importance in the finale but I feel the screen play could have a much better outcome if it is handled better or differently, perhaps with more sensitivity.

    Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin). Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with. Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband. The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making. As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists. Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything. You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like "Training Day" and "Monster's Ball" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in "The Piano" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself.

    In my opinion a good alternative film stands out because of its emphasis on character development and story line. The Piano fails in both aspects. The film tries to depict a love triangle without providing the necessary background. The location of the story is never explicitated. The viewer is left to derive it must be New Zealand because the indigenous population are called Maoris. The viewer lacks crucial information about the social position and the past of the protagonists and therefore cannot understand their state of mind and motives. How did Ada become mute ? Who fathered little Flora ? Why was Alisdair chosen as her husband ? How did she feel when this arranged marriage was announced to her ? Is Alisdair a rich or important member of the community ? What exactly is his trade ? How and why did he choose Ada for a wife ? Why is he so shy and insecure ? How did Baines end up in New Zealand ? Is he an employee, an associate or simply a neighbour of Alisdair ? Why is he so bitter ? ... To top of the lack of character development the actions and decisions of the protagonists are often completely illogical. Ada has clearly stated to Alisdair how dear the piano is to her. Therefore surely he knows trading the instrument with Baines will hardly win her heart ? Baines seems merely interested in the looks of Ada and manipulates her into sleeping with him. Why does she suddenly fall in love with him ? Why would Flora side with her stepfather against her own mother ? Why does Baines not rush to rescue Ada immediately upon learning her dreadful fate ? ... Finally, the clumsy portrayal of some scenes ads to the frustration of the viewer. Who would manage to cut off just a single digit with an axe when the entire hand is on the block ?! ... In conclusion I find The Piano utterly nonsensical. How a budget was established to shoot this crap let alone how it gathered such critic acclaim is beyond me. There, now anyone opposed can brand me an ignorant sexist ;-) ;-) .

    Agree with others there is not a single character here that is likable or you want to care about. In Hunter, her main character is walled-in and obnoxious to say the least. She made no attempt to relate to anyone except her daughter, then suddenly she's found this great affection for the perverted, scheming Mr.Bain, the neighbor. It was not believable. As for the husband, who for a moment looks like Robert Wagner in a rain hat in an early post, only to revealed to be the inexpressive,aloof Sam Neil whose appearance in any movie is guaranteed flop; maybe the bad attracts the inept. The young daughter is equally repugnant with her own brand of contemptuousness. Lastly director Jane Campion who was New Zealand born, bored a haughty supremacy attitude toward the natives - a third character in this movie. There were no worthy diaglog written for them and they were collectively a servitude with low intel, from the way they were portraited. If Hunter's only expression comes from playing her piano, or so the underlying theme and the title tells us, you'd wonder why there are not more varying pieces? It is the same piece over and over again except one brief underscored occasion. Could Hunter feels the same mood all the time, which appears that way actually with her dour complexion. Overall the film moved too slow, too bleak and without substance for much of the first half. There were genuine moments of importance in the finale but I feel the screen play could have a much better outcome if it is handled better or differently, perhaps with more sensitivity.

    Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin). Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with. Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband. The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making. As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists. Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything. You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like "Training Day" and "Monster's Ball" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in "The Piano" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but "The Piano" gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, "The Piano" is just such a film.

    I have to state that the movie was amazing, but was also one one of the most honest and gut-wrenching films I've seen in a very long time. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mute, brilliant piano mistress who's recently been "sold"/"married" to a man she's never met (Sam Neil) in New Zealand. Ana Paquin as her daughter is wonderful and expressive addition to the cast. The circumstances of Ada's "marriage" and affair are both pitiful and enthralling -- she captivates you with her blank, yet at the same time incredibly deep stare, and the viewer is left wondering what she might be thinking ... not in the frustrating, "I don't understand where this film is going," but in the "how would I act in this situation" sort of way. To that question, there seems to be relatively no answers, except the ones provided on screen. The honesty and sadness, and even the desperate kind of hope or joy expressed in the resolution of the film left me both sick to my stomach, and glad to have seen it. This movie should not be approached by the faint of heart -- it's both so strange and so real, and the graphic / traumatic scenes verge on the deeply unsettling. Well worth seeing, but be warned.

    As a piano historian, I find it amusing that in a film with its plot centred around a Broadwood square piano, nobody bothered to take a moment to check what one should look like. There are plenty of them on the net, but instead, we have this odd-looking object on the beach that is presumably based on trying to justify the other object used inside the house. That, in turn, seems to be a grand piano, with the ends of the keyboard filled in by peculiar wooden blocks, and the tail end hidden through a partition. Where is the historical accuracy, the authenticity that we come to expect in a costume drama like this? If they made equivalent mistakes with costumes, or allowed a plane to fly over the set, people would say it was unacceptable. Does anyone have any answers for me?
