    A Perfect World is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by John Lee Hancock. It stars Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther and Bradley Whitford. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

    "A Perfect World", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick. It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10

    Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.

    "Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - Eastwood Most of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World". Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

    Clint Eastwood is an outstanding Director. He directs A Perfect World masterly and we really feel en emotional involvement with the characters and the story. T.J. Lowther is fantastic as the boy kidnapped by Butch (Kevin Costner), and it is great to see an unlikely friendship develop between the two despite their huge difference in background and age. Costner becomes almost like a father figure for Buzz, and the ending is slightly overdrawn and predictable, but is nonetheless deeply saddening. Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer. Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.

    There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart. Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible. A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but. Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.

    Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

    A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther. A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation. The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!

Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

    "A Perfect World", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick. It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10

    Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.

    "Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - Eastwood Most of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World". Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

    Clint Eastwood is an outstanding Director. He directs A Perfect World masterly and we really feel en emotional involvement with the characters and the story. T.J. Lowther is fantastic as the boy kidnapped by Butch (Kevin Costner), and it is great to see an unlikely friendship develop between the two despite their huge difference in background and age. Costner becomes almost like a father figure for Buzz, and the ending is slightly overdrawn and predictable, but is nonetheless deeply saddening. Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer. Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.

    There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart. Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible. A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but. Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.

    Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

    A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther. A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation. The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!

    A Perfect World is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by John Lee Hancock. It stars Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther and Bradley Whitford. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

    Clint Eastwood is an outstanding Director. He directs A Perfect World masterly and we really feel en emotional involvement with the characters and the story. T.J. Lowther is fantastic as the boy kidnapped by Butch (Kevin Costner), and it is great to see an unlikely friendship develop between the two despite their huge difference in background and age. Costner becomes almost like a father figure for Buzz, and the ending is slightly overdrawn and predictable, but is nonetheless deeply saddening. Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer. Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.

    There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart. Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible. A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but. Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.

    Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

    A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther. A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation. The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!

    A Perfect World is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by John Lee Hancock. It stars Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther and Bradley Whitford. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

    "A Perfect World", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick. It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10

    Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.

    "Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - Eastwood Most of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World". Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer. Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.

    There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart. Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible. A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but. Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.

    Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

    A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther. A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation. The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!

    A Perfect World is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by John Lee Hancock. It stars Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther and Bradley Whitford. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

    "A Perfect World", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick. It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10

    Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.

    "Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - Eastwood Most of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World". Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

    Clint Eastwood is an outstanding Director. He directs A Perfect World masterly and we really feel en emotional involvement with the characters and the story. T.J. Lowther is fantastic as the boy kidnapped by Butch (Kevin Costner), and it is great to see an unlikely friendship develop between the two despite their huge difference in background and age. Costner becomes almost like a father figure for Buzz, and the ending is slightly overdrawn and predictable, but is nonetheless deeply saddening. Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer. Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.

This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

    A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther. A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation. The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!

    A Perfect World is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by John Lee Hancock. It stars Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther and Bradley Whitford. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

    "A Perfect World", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick. It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10

    Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.

    "Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - Eastwood Most of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World". Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

    Clint Eastwood is an outstanding Director. He directs A Perfect World masterly and we really feel en emotional involvement with the characters and the story. T.J. Lowther is fantastic as the boy kidnapped by Butch (Kevin Costner), and it is great to see an unlikely friendship develop between the two despite their huge difference in background and age. Costner becomes almost like a father figure for Buzz, and the ending is slightly overdrawn and predictable, but is nonetheless deeply saddening. Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer. Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.

    There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart. Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible. A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but. Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.

    Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

    "A Perfect World", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick. It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10

    Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.

    "Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - Eastwood Most of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World". Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

    Clint Eastwood is an outstanding Director. He directs A Perfect World masterly and we really feel en emotional involvement with the characters and the story. T.J. Lowther is fantastic as the boy kidnapped by Butch (Kevin Costner), and it is great to see an unlikely friendship develop between the two despite their huge difference in background and age. Costner becomes almost like a father figure for Buzz, and the ending is slightly overdrawn and predictable, but is nonetheless deeply saddening. Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer. Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.

    There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart. Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible. A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but. Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.

    Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

    A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther. A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation. The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!

    A Perfect World is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by John Lee Hancock. It stars Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther and Bradley Whitford. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

    Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.

    "Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - Eastwood Most of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World". Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

    Clint Eastwood is an outstanding Director. He directs A Perfect World masterly and we really feel en emotional involvement with the characters and the story. T.J. Lowther is fantastic as the boy kidnapped by Butch (Kevin Costner), and it is great to see an unlikely friendship develop between the two despite their huge difference in background and age. Costner becomes almost like a father figure for Buzz, and the ending is slightly overdrawn and predictable, but is nonetheless deeply saddening. Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer. Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.

    There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart. Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible. A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but. Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.

    Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

    A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther. A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation. The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!

    A Perfect World is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by John Lee Hancock. It stars Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther and Bradley Whitford. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

    "A Perfect World", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick. It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10

    Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.

    "Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - Eastwood Most of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World". Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

    Clint Eastwood is an outstanding Director. He directs A Perfect World masterly and we really feel en emotional involvement with the characters and the story. T.J. Lowther is fantastic as the boy kidnapped by Butch (Kevin Costner), and it is great to see an unlikely friendship develop between the two despite their huge difference in background and age. Costner becomes almost like a father figure for Buzz, and the ending is slightly overdrawn and predictable, but is nonetheless deeply saddening. Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer. Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner. I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.

    There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart. Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible. A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but. Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.

    Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

    A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther. A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation. The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!

    A Perfect World is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by John Lee Hancock. It stars Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther and Bradley Whitford. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green. Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups. Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star. On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted. It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner. There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10

    Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man. This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie. Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.

    "A Perfect World", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick. It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10

    Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.

    "Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - Eastwood Most of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World". Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie  lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc  Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains. The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention. The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times. It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s. Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum. 8/10  See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.

This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both. A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem. When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine. It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart. Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb.

He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible. A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but. Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood. Directed by: Clint Eastwood.

    Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.

    There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance. The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously. The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials. Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department. Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.

    A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther. A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation. The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!
