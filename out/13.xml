    This is a fine writing and storytelling by Woody Allen. It's actually clever and humorous, despite situations that could be serious. This movie goes in more of a light-hearted approach. With a bit of fate and ironic circumstances thrown in, that works well as a whole. Even if some of the humorous parts, rely on dense characters a bit too much. When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby. Later Woody Allen looks for his son's real mother, because of ulterior motives. And ends up controlling her, even if in his case he is doing it with mostly good intentions. But the ironic, clever, dense humors is blended in well and fits together with the story as a whole. Although it does get a bit self-indulgent at times. Mainly do to the fact that Woody Allen's character in this being the only rational or at least the smart one for the most part. While everyone around him is either naive or dense. Besides his self-conscious and imaginary sidekick. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and how it all played out. One of Woody Allen's good works. The term "the curiosity killed the cat" is a positive thing when it comes to this. And also one the best part about this movie is Mira Sorvino who just owns the role as Linda Ash. 7.6/10

    Woody Allen stars in his latest picture that he also wrote and direct as Lenny, a New York sportswriter bored by his wife and attracted to a hooker that happens to be the mother-though she doesn't know it-of his adopted son in this film,Mighty Aphrodite.Together in the cast with Allen are Woody Allen,Mira Sorvino,Helena Bonham Carter,Michael Rapaport and F. Murray Abraham. Lenny is trapped in a bad marriage to high-strung art dealer Amanda, but he finds solace in his relationship with his adopted young son. Indeed, he grows so fond of the boy that he decides to track down the boy's real mother, expecting to discover a brilliant professional. Instead, he finds Linda, a ditzy prostitute and porno star who mingles casual vulgarity with disarming innocence. Despite his initial disillusionment, Lenny soon develops a fondness for Linda and decides to play matchmaker, setting her up with a handsome young boxer who is equally good-hearted and scatterbrained. While the contrast between the free-spirited Linda and the uptight Lenny provides the bulk of the laughs, hints of Allen's more literary humor are also present, particularly in the scenes involving a roaming Greek chorus commenting upon Lenny's fate. This is a surprisingly sweet and brilliant film with great performances particularly that from Mira Sorvino,who portrayed a bubble-headed hooker and porn star.It has a nice combination of smart comedy and some of wacky energy.It is a delight to watch.

    Since I madly ADORE Woody Allen films, it will be considered very biased and redundant of me to write a review for this film and fill it up with eulogies no end. But even so, after so many reviews, much earlier than mine (I just saw this film, having missed it I don't know why) and also much better than mine, I still want to say that I loved it, although I found it a rehash of some previous films of his, but the charm is there, New York is there, his characters are always meaty and in this case, Mira Sorvino creates a Tsunami of sorts with her 'Linda Ash' impersonation, as forceful a creation as the one given by Giulietta Massina, that unforgettable 'Gelsomina', for "La Strada", that Fellini masterpiece of yesteryear. To me, her interpretation is worth a TEN stars (not the film though) I didn't care much for the Greek Chorus... Could I have been prejudiced by the raggedy look of their costumes? they seemed to have been made with dirty dishcloths while the performers were waiting for them to be put together by rushed and long-suffering seamstresses, seating on those steps (here one seats and seats...) where they performed their musical numbers. If you saw a prehistoric movie: "Down to Earth" (1940s) with Rita Hayworth, the Choruses costumes were... HEAVENLY! These ones looked out of "The Planet of the Apes", Yuk! But in general it's a fun movie to watch.

    This is a modern fable, that is narrated and commented by a Greek chorus.Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib ends up adopting a boy, Max, with his wife Amanda.In a few years they start facing some problems in their marriage, and Lenny wants to know about Max' real mother.To his surprise she turns out to be a hooker/porn actress.He gets close to her as a client, but all he does is talk with her.At first, anyway.Mighty Aphrodite (1995) is a Woody Allen film, where he also plays the lead.And he does it with the Woody-like style.And, like in any Allen movie, the rest of the actors are A-list.Helena Bonham Carter is terrific as Amanda Sloan Weinrib.Mira Sorvino is pretty fantastic as Linda Ash.Michael Rapaport is great as her dumb date Kevin.Then there are superb people, like F. Murray Abraham as Greek Chorus Leader.Olympia Dukakis is Jocasta.David Ogden Stiers plays Laius.Jack Warden is the blind prophet, Tiresias.Danielle Ferland plays Cassandra.Peter Weller plays Jerry Bender.Donald Symington is Amanda's Father.Claire Bloom, who turned 80 earlier this year, is Amanda's Mother.Tony Sirico plays the part of Boxing Trainer.Paul Giamatti is seen as Extras Guild Researcher.This is quite amusing Woody Allen experience.It's quite hilarious when Linda uses that language known from her films with Lenny.And when Lenny talks with the Greek chorus people.For Woody Allen fans this movie gives what they expect from the man.And that is a comedy with some wit.

    In many ways Mighty Aphrodite is simply a piece of entertaining fluff dressed up with some of the standard Woody Allen neuroses (the path of true love not running smooth, the spark of passion, the yearning to make a mark) but in many other ways it's up there with some of his finest comedies. Woody plays the leading male role (as well as writing and directing, unsurprisingly enough), a man named Lenny who finds himself the father of an adopted child when his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides that they should have a baby but also knows that they're both very busy people. A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path. With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of "reality" (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here. Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing. If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

    A Swift, Lighthearted Antidote to Woody's Own Perceived Pessimism

    Woody is a realistic idealist, because to persist making contemplative films is to assert how buoyant you actually are. His buoyancy is not to be associated with that articulated by his more hopeful characters. The average rubrics of idealism and cynicism offer fertile readings of several of his later films. How best to support such analyses? The views to be favored are those that fall back neither on some proclamation of, or biographical facts about, the creator, nor to the partialities of the interpreter. Allen's work helps us sidestep both of these moves: the biographical myth and the reading of a connotation into the content instead of interpreting what it might have to say, because he presents the alternatives of optimism and pessimism in dramatic rather than discursive ways. This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism: It's worthwhile to carry on. This modern playing-up of Pygmalion divulges its solemn undercurrents, with observations by the Greek chorus, which periodically bursts into song and dance, while in unison developing a plot that lends itself to farce, Woody playing a sportswriter who's initially opposed to adopting a kid despite his career-driven wife Helena Bonham Carter being unable to get pregnant for the sake of her job, yet she has her way and they adopt a boy they call Max. As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart. Although the increasingly colloquial Greek chorus might sound like a cumbersome adjunct to a Woody Allen comedy about contemporary Manhattan neurotics, it truly works properly. Chorus members including F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis and David Ogden Stiers make urgent notes of the choices Lenny is making, and their peculiar counterpoint helps Allen pull off some of the more clearly perfunctory plot developments. By the end of the movie, when the deus ex machina arrives from the sky in a helicopter, it feels like an stimulation rather than what it is, an expedient plot device. As Linda, then 29-year-old Mira Sorvino's voice is heavy Brooklyn lightened by helium and thus made comic, which mitigates the explicit casual vulgarity of her lexicon, making it seemingly na&iuml;ve. Her Oscar win has apparently been subject to the same "come-on's" and "gimme-a-break's" as Marisa Tomei's for My Cousin Vinny, perhaps because young bimbo roles, including those of Brooklyn spitfires, are often so two-dimensional, they're all taken for granted as precisely that. But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character. Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending. Feels like Woody's just treading water here, but even when it becomes unquestionably frivolous, Mighty Aphrodite remains an attractively made, swift, lighthearted dessert that transpires as pleasant mid-range Woody. He's best known for this spirit of romantic comedy, having transitioned from broad screwball to more storied and romantic films. Mighty Aphrodite, during his freshly post-Farrow period of varied sorts of works, is generally inclined at a gratifying and more or less reliable reading.

    Mighty Aphrodite is Woody Allen in a good mood; nice, considerate, thoughtful and completely engaging and delightful to watch. Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style. In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things: Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs. All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding. Life is a mysterious fig, and Woody Allen knows the best way to understand it is to laugh at its mysteries.

    Woody Allen is boon to Cinema. A blessed talent, a potential institution, who makes his cinema fun, with ease. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a yet another classic from this genius. Humor, Romance and emotions are brought out with flying colors. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is probably the funniest rom-com Allen attempted in the 90's. Allen plays a hen-picked husband, Helena Bonham Carter is his wife, who have adopted a son, who's mom is Sorvino. Allen adds in narrators in the name of F.Murray Abraham, and thus, starts this whacked-up journey. It's a terrific film, with a more-than-flawless culmination. Allen's direction & writing, as always, is perfect. I also loved Carlo Di Palma's Cinematography. In the acting department, Sorvino is marvelous. She deserved all the acclaim and awards she got! Allen is lovable. Undoubtedly, one of his best works. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the bossy wife. F.Murray Abraham is flawless as the lead narrator. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a must watch film. It's a winner all the way! Hence. from my side, Two Big Thumbs Up!

    This is a very enjoyable film that takes its premises from Greek tragedy; that is to say, the gods are really in charge. They are the apotheosis of happenstance. The mixture of good intentions and fundamental humanity are portrayed here. We all want the best as does Woody's character. Mara Sorvino proved to be quite a wonderful choice for the seemingly scatterbrained, but very wise other woman. The chorus is hilarious with its askance a commentary. It all plays out, and without giving anything away, manages to trick the mere mortals. Woody's sense of humor is at work all along as he gives up himself in the presence of a strong woman. Not a major film, but well worth seeing.

    Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Allen) and his wife (Bonham-Carter) adopt a baby from an anonymous mother. After a few years pass, Lenny starts to wonder about the woman. Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her. Lenny is dismayed, maybe even terrified, to find that Linda (Sorvino,) the mother, is a beautiful $200-an-hour prostitute. So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis,) who add their own unique take on the proceedings. I've always preferred Woody Allen's comedies over his dramas. This one is probably one of my favorites. This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin. The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever.

    This is a fine writing and storytelling by Woody Allen. It's actually clever and humorous, despite situations that could be serious. This movie goes in more of a light-hearted approach. With a bit of fate and ironic circumstances thrown in, that works well as a whole. Even if some of the humorous parts, rely on dense characters a bit too much. When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby. Later Woody Allen looks for his son's real mother, because of ulterior motives. And ends up controlling her, even if in his case he is doing it with mostly good intentions. But the ironic, clever, dense humors is blended in well and fits together with the story as a whole. Although it does get a bit self-indulgent at times. Mainly do to the fact that Woody Allen's character in this being the only rational or at least the smart one for the most part. While everyone around him is either naive or dense. Besides his self-conscious and imaginary sidekick. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and how it all played out. One of Woody Allen's good works. The term "the curiosity killed the cat" is a positive thing when it comes to this. And also one the best part about this movie is Mira Sorvino who just owns the role as Linda Ash. 7.6/10

    In many ways Mighty Aphrodite is simply a piece of entertaining fluff dressed up with some of the standard Woody Allen neuroses (the path of true love not running smooth, the spark of passion, the yearning to make a mark) but in many other ways it's up there with some of his finest comedies. Woody plays the leading male role (as well as writing and directing, unsurprisingly enough), a man named Lenny who finds himself the father of an adopted child when his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides that they should have a baby but also knows that they're both very busy people. A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path. With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of "reality" (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here. Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing. If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism: It's worthwhile to carry on. This modern playing-up of Pygmalion divulges its solemn undercurrents, with observations by the Greek chorus, which periodically bursts into song and dance, while in unison developing a plot that lends itself to farce, Woody playing a sportswriter who's initially opposed to adopting a kid despite his career-driven wife Helena Bonham Carter being unable to get pregnant for the sake of her job, yet she has her way and they adopt a boy they call Max. As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart. Although the increasingly colloquial Greek chorus might sound like a cumbersome adjunct to a Woody Allen comedy about contemporary Manhattan neurotics, it truly works properly. Chorus members including F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis and David Ogden Stiers make urgent notes of the choices Lenny is making, and their peculiar counterpoint helps Allen pull off some of the more clearly perfunctory plot developments. By the end of the movie, when the deus ex machina arrives from the sky in a helicopter, it feels like an stimulation rather than what it is, an expedient plot device. As Linda, then 29-year-old Mira Sorvino's voice is heavy Brooklyn lightened by helium and thus made comic, which mitigates the explicit casual vulgarity of her lexicon, making it seemingly na&iuml;ve. Her Oscar win has apparently been subject to the same "come-on's" and "gimme-a-break's" as Marisa Tomei's for My Cousin Vinny, perhaps because young bimbo roles, including those of Brooklyn spitfires, are often so two-dimensional, they're all taken for granted as precisely that. But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character. Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending. Feels like Woody's just treading water here, but even when it becomes unquestionably frivolous, Mighty Aphrodite remains an attractively made, swift, lighthearted dessert that transpires as pleasant mid-range Woody. He's best known for this spirit of romantic comedy, having transitioned from broad screwball to more storied and romantic films. Mighty Aphrodite, during his freshly post-Farrow period of varied sorts of works, is generally inclined at a gratifying and more or less reliable reading.

    Mighty Aphrodite is Woody Allen in a good mood; nice, considerate, thoughtful and completely engaging and delightful to watch. Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style. In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things: Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs. All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding. Life is a mysterious fig, and Woody Allen knows the best way to understand it is to laugh at its mysteries.

    Woody Allen is boon to Cinema. A blessed talent, a potential institution, who makes his cinema fun, with ease. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a yet another classic from this genius. Humor, Romance and emotions are brought out with flying colors. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is probably the funniest rom-com Allen attempted in the 90's. Allen plays a hen-picked husband, Helena Bonham Carter is his wife, who have adopted a son, who's mom is Sorvino. Allen adds in narrators in the name of F.Murray Abraham, and thus, starts this whacked-up journey. It's a terrific film, with a more-than-flawless culmination. Allen's direction & writing, as always, is perfect. I also loved Carlo Di Palma's Cinematography. In the acting department, Sorvino is marvelous. She deserved all the acclaim and awards she got! Allen is lovable. Undoubtedly, one of his best works. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the bossy wife. F.Murray Abraham is flawless as the lead narrator. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a must watch film. It's a winner all the way! Hence. from my side, Two Big Thumbs Up!

    This is a very enjoyable film that takes its premises from Greek tragedy; that is to say, the gods are really in charge. They are the apotheosis of happenstance. The mixture of good intentions and fundamental humanity are portrayed here. We all want the best as does Woody's character. Mara Sorvino proved to be quite a wonderful choice for the seemingly scatterbrained, but very wise other woman. The chorus is hilarious with its askance a commentary. It all plays out, and without giving anything away, manages to trick the mere mortals. Woody's sense of humor is at work all along as he gives up himself in the presence of a strong woman. Not a major film, but well worth seeing.

    Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Allen) and his wife (Bonham-Carter) adopt a baby from an anonymous mother. After a few years pass, Lenny starts to wonder about the woman. Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her. Lenny is dismayed, maybe even terrified, to find that Linda (Sorvino,) the mother, is a beautiful $200-an-hour prostitute. So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis,) who add their own unique take on the proceedings. I've always preferred Woody Allen's comedies over his dramas. This one is probably one of my favorites. This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin. The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever.

    This is a fine writing and storytelling by Woody Allen. It's actually clever and humorous, despite situations that could be serious. This movie goes in more of a light-hearted approach. With a bit of fate and ironic circumstances thrown in, that works well as a whole. Even if some of the humorous parts, rely on dense characters a bit too much. When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby. Later Woody Allen looks for his son's real mother, because of ulterior motives. And ends up controlling her, even if in his case he is doing it with mostly good intentions. But the ironic, clever, dense humors is blended in well and fits together with the story as a whole. Although it does get a bit self-indulgent at times. Mainly do to the fact that Woody Allen's character in this being the only rational or at least the smart one for the most part. While everyone around him is either naive or dense. Besides his self-conscious and imaginary sidekick. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and how it all played out. One of Woody Allen's good works. The term "the curiosity killed the cat" is a positive thing when it comes to this. And also one the best part about this movie is Mira Sorvino who just owns the role as Linda Ash. 7.6/10

    Woody Allen stars in his latest picture that he also wrote and direct as Lenny, a New York sportswriter bored by his wife and attracted to a hooker that happens to be the mother-though she doesn't know it-of his adopted son in this film,Mighty Aphrodite.Together in the cast with Allen are Woody Allen,Mira Sorvino,Helena Bonham Carter,Michael Rapaport and F. Murray Abraham. Lenny is trapped in a bad marriage to high-strung art dealer Amanda, but he finds solace in his relationship with his adopted young son. Indeed, he grows so fond of the boy that he decides to track down the boy's real mother, expecting to discover a brilliant professional. Instead, he finds Linda, a ditzy prostitute and porno star who mingles casual vulgarity with disarming innocence. Despite his initial disillusionment, Lenny soon develops a fondness for Linda and decides to play matchmaker, setting her up with a handsome young boxer who is equally good-hearted and scatterbrained. While the contrast between the free-spirited Linda and the uptight Lenny provides the bulk of the laughs, hints of Allen's more literary humor are also present, particularly in the scenes involving a roaming Greek chorus commenting upon Lenny's fate. This is a surprisingly sweet and brilliant film with great performances particularly that from Mira Sorvino,who portrayed a bubble-headed hooker and porn star.It has a nice combination of smart comedy and some of wacky energy.It is a delight to watch.

    Since I madly ADORE Woody Allen films, it will be considered very biased and redundant of me to write a review for this film and fill it up with eulogies no end. But even so, after so many reviews, much earlier than mine (I just saw this film, having missed it I don't know why) and also much better than mine, I still want to say that I loved it, although I found it a rehash of some previous films of his, but the charm is there, New York is there, his characters are always meaty and in this case, Mira Sorvino creates a Tsunami of sorts with her 'Linda Ash' impersonation, as forceful a creation as the one given by Giulietta Massina, that unforgettable 'Gelsomina', for "La Strada", that Fellini masterpiece of yesteryear. To me, her interpretation is worth a TEN stars (not the film though) I didn't care much for the Greek Chorus... Could I have been prejudiced by the raggedy look of their costumes? they seemed to have been made with dirty dishcloths while the performers were waiting for them to be put together by rushed and long-suffering seamstresses, seating on those steps (here one seats and seats...) where they performed their musical numbers. If you saw a prehistoric movie: "Down to Earth" (1940s) with Rita Hayworth, the Choruses costumes were... HEAVENLY! These ones looked out of "The Planet of the Apes", Yuk! But in general it's a fun movie to watch.

    This is a modern fable, that is narrated and commented by a Greek chorus.Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib ends up adopting a boy, Max, with his wife Amanda.In a few years they start facing some problems in their marriage, and Lenny wants to know about Max' real mother.To his surprise she turns out to be a hooker/porn actress.He gets close to her as a client, but all he does is talk with her.At first, anyway.Mighty Aphrodite (1995) is a Woody Allen film, where he also plays the lead.And he does it with the Woody-like style.And, like in any Allen movie, the rest of the actors are A-list.Helena Bonham Carter is terrific as Amanda Sloan Weinrib.Mira Sorvino is pretty fantastic as Linda Ash.Michael Rapaport is great as her dumb date Kevin.Then there are superb people, like F. Murray Abraham as Greek Chorus Leader.Olympia Dukakis is Jocasta.David Ogden Stiers plays Laius.Jack Warden is the blind prophet, Tiresias.Danielle Ferland plays Cassandra.Peter Weller plays Jerry Bender.Donald Symington is Amanda's Father.Claire Bloom, who turned 80 earlier this year, is Amanda's Mother.Tony Sirico plays the part of Boxing Trainer.Paul Giamatti is seen as Extras Guild Researcher.This is quite amusing Woody Allen experience.It's quite hilarious when Linda uses that language known from her films with Lenny.And when Lenny talks with the Greek chorus people.For Woody Allen fans this movie gives what they expect from the man.And that is a comedy with some wit.

    In many ways Mighty Aphrodite is simply a piece of entertaining fluff dressed up with some of the standard Woody Allen neuroses (the path of true love not running smooth, the spark of passion, the yearning to make a mark) but in many other ways it's up there with some of his finest comedies. Woody plays the leading male role (as well as writing and directing, unsurprisingly enough), a man named Lenny who finds himself the father of an adopted child when his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides that they should have a baby but also knows that they're both very busy people. A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path. With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of "reality" (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here. Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing. If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

    Woody is a realistic idealist, because to persist making contemplative films is to assert how buoyant you actually are. His buoyancy is not to be associated with that articulated by his more hopeful characters. The average rubrics of idealism and cynicism offer fertile readings of several of his later films. How best to support such analyses? The views to be favored are those that fall back neither on some proclamation of, or biographical facts about, the creator, nor to the partialities of the interpreter. Allen's work helps us sidestep both of these moves: the biographical myth and the reading of a connotation into the content instead of interpreting what it might have to say, because he presents the alternatives of optimism and pessimism in dramatic rather than discursive ways. This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism: It's worthwhile to carry on. This modern playing-up of Pygmalion divulges its solemn undercurrents, with observations by the Greek chorus, which periodically bursts into song and dance, while in unison developing a plot that lends itself to farce, Woody playing a sportswriter who's initially opposed to adopting a kid despite his career-driven wife Helena Bonham Carter being unable to get pregnant for the sake of her job, yet she has her way and they adopt a boy they call Max. As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart. Although the increasingly colloquial Greek chorus might sound like a cumbersome adjunct to a Woody Allen comedy about contemporary Manhattan neurotics, it truly works properly. Chorus members including F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis and David Ogden Stiers make urgent notes of the choices Lenny is making, and their peculiar counterpoint helps Allen pull off some of the more clearly perfunctory plot developments. By the end of the movie, when the deus ex machina arrives from the sky in a helicopter, it feels like an stimulation rather than what it is, an expedient plot device. As Linda, then 29-year-old Mira Sorvino's voice is heavy Brooklyn lightened by helium and thus made comic, which mitigates the explicit casual vulgarity of her lexicon, making it seemingly na&iuml;ve. Her Oscar win has apparently been subject to the same "come-on's" and "gimme-a-break's" as Marisa Tomei's for My Cousin Vinny, perhaps because young bimbo roles, including those of Brooklyn spitfires, are often so two-dimensional, they're all taken for granted as precisely that. But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character. Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending. Feels like Woody's just treading water here, but even when it becomes unquestionably frivolous, Mighty Aphrodite remains an attractively made, swift, lighthearted dessert that transpires as pleasant mid-range Woody. He's best known for this spirit of romantic comedy, having transitioned from broad screwball to more storied and romantic films. Mighty Aphrodite, during his freshly post-Farrow period of varied sorts of works, is generally inclined at a gratifying and more or less reliable reading.

    Mighty Aphrodite is Woody Allen in a good mood; nice, considerate, thoughtful and completely engaging and delightful to watch. Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style. In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things: Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs. All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding. Life is a mysterious fig, and Woody Allen knows the best way to understand it is to laugh at its mysteries.

Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her.

So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis,) who add their own unique take on the proceedings. I've always preferred Woody Allen's comedies over his dramas. This one is probably one of my favorites. This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin. The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever.

    This is a fine writing and storytelling by Woody Allen. It's actually clever and humorous, despite situations that could be serious. This movie goes in more of a light-hearted approach. With a bit of fate and ironic circumstances thrown in, that works well as a whole. Even if some of the humorous parts, rely on dense characters a bit too much. When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby. Later Woody Allen looks for his son's real mother, because of ulterior motives. And ends up controlling her, even if in his case he is doing it with mostly good intentions. But the ironic, clever, dense humors is blended in well and fits together with the story as a whole. Although it does get a bit self-indulgent at times. Mainly do to the fact that Woody Allen's character in this being the only rational or at least the smart one for the most part. While everyone around him is either naive or dense. Besides his self-conscious and imaginary sidekick. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and how it all played out. One of Woody Allen's good works. The term "the curiosity killed the cat" is a positive thing when it comes to this. And also one the best part about this movie is Mira Sorvino who just owns the role as Linda Ash. 7.6/10

    Woody Allen stars in his latest picture that he also wrote and direct as Lenny, a New York sportswriter bored by his wife and attracted to a hooker that happens to be the mother-though she doesn't know it-of his adopted son in this film,Mighty Aphrodite.Together in the cast with Allen are Woody Allen,Mira Sorvino,Helena Bonham Carter,Michael Rapaport and F. Murray Abraham. Lenny is trapped in a bad marriage to high-strung art dealer Amanda, but he finds solace in his relationship with his adopted young son. Indeed, he grows so fond of the boy that he decides to track down the boy's real mother, expecting to discover a brilliant professional. Instead, he finds Linda, a ditzy prostitute and porno star who mingles casual vulgarity with disarming innocence. Despite his initial disillusionment, Lenny soon develops a fondness for Linda and decides to play matchmaker, setting her up with a handsome young boxer who is equally good-hearted and scatterbrained. While the contrast between the free-spirited Linda and the uptight Lenny provides the bulk of the laughs, hints of Allen's more literary humor are also present, particularly in the scenes involving a roaming Greek chorus commenting upon Lenny's fate. This is a surprisingly sweet and brilliant film with great performances particularly that from Mira Sorvino,who portrayed a bubble-headed hooker and porn star.It has a nice combination of smart comedy and some of wacky energy.It is a delight to watch.

    Since I madly ADORE Woody Allen films, it will be considered very biased and redundant of me to write a review for this film and fill it up with eulogies no end. But even so, after so many reviews, much earlier than mine (I just saw this film, having missed it I don't know why) and also much better than mine, I still want to say that I loved it, although I found it a rehash of some previous films of his, but the charm is there, New York is there, his characters are always meaty and in this case, Mira Sorvino creates a Tsunami of sorts with her 'Linda Ash' impersonation, as forceful a creation as the one given by Giulietta Massina, that unforgettable 'Gelsomina', for "La Strada", that Fellini masterpiece of yesteryear. To me, her interpretation is worth a TEN stars (not the film though) I didn't care much for the Greek Chorus... Could I have been prejudiced by the raggedy look of their costumes? they seemed to have been made with dirty dishcloths while the performers were waiting for them to be put together by rushed and long-suffering seamstresses, seating on those steps (here one seats and seats...) where they performed their musical numbers. If you saw a prehistoric movie: "Down to Earth" (1940s) with Rita Hayworth, the Choruses costumes were... HEAVENLY! These ones looked out of "The Planet of the Apes", Yuk! But in general it's a fun movie to watch.

    This is a modern fable, that is narrated and commented by a Greek chorus.Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib ends up adopting a boy, Max, with his wife Amanda.In a few years they start facing some problems in their marriage, and Lenny wants to know about Max' real mother.To his surprise she turns out to be a hooker/porn actress.He gets close to her as a client, but all he does is talk with her.At first, anyway.Mighty Aphrodite (1995) is a Woody Allen film, where he also plays the lead.And he does it with the Woody-like style.And, like in any Allen movie, the rest of the actors are A-list.Helena Bonham Carter is terrific as Amanda Sloan Weinrib.Mira Sorvino is pretty fantastic as Linda Ash.Michael Rapaport is great as her dumb date Kevin.Then there are superb people, like F. Murray Abraham as Greek Chorus Leader.Olympia Dukakis is Jocasta.David Ogden Stiers plays Laius.Jack Warden is the blind prophet, Tiresias.Danielle Ferland plays Cassandra.Peter Weller plays Jerry Bender.Donald Symington is Amanda's Father.Claire Bloom, who turned 80 earlier this year, is Amanda's Mother.Tony Sirico plays the part of Boxing Trainer.Paul Giamatti is seen as Extras Guild Researcher.This is quite amusing Woody Allen experience.It's quite hilarious when Linda uses that language known from her films with Lenny.And when Lenny talks with the Greek chorus people.For Woody Allen fans this movie gives what they expect from the man.And that is a comedy with some wit.

    In many ways Mighty Aphrodite is simply a piece of entertaining fluff dressed up with some of the standard Woody Allen neuroses (the path of true love not running smooth, the spark of passion, the yearning to make a mark) but in many other ways it's up there with some of his finest comedies. Woody plays the leading male role (as well as writing and directing, unsurprisingly enough), a man named Lenny who finds himself the father of an adopted child when his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides that they should have a baby but also knows that they're both very busy people. A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path. With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of "reality" (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here. Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing. If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

    A Swift, Lighthearted Antidote to Woody's Own Perceived Pessimism

    Woody is a realistic idealist, because to persist making contemplative films is to assert how buoyant you actually are. His buoyancy is not to be associated with that articulated by his more hopeful characters. The average rubrics of idealism and cynicism offer fertile readings of several of his later films. How best to support such analyses? The views to be favored are those that fall back neither on some proclamation of, or biographical facts about, the creator, nor to the partialities of the interpreter. Allen's work helps us sidestep both of these moves: the biographical myth and the reading of a connotation into the content instead of interpreting what it might have to say, because he presents the alternatives of optimism and pessimism in dramatic rather than discursive ways. This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism: It's worthwhile to carry on. This modern playing-up of Pygmalion divulges its solemn undercurrents, with observations by the Greek chorus, which periodically bursts into song and dance, while in unison developing a plot that lends itself to farce, Woody playing a sportswriter who's initially opposed to adopting a kid despite his career-driven wife Helena Bonham Carter being unable to get pregnant for the sake of her job, yet she has her way and they adopt a boy they call Max. As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart. Although the increasingly colloquial Greek chorus might sound like a cumbersome adjunct to a Woody Allen comedy about contemporary Manhattan neurotics, it truly works properly. Chorus members including F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis and David Ogden Stiers make urgent notes of the choices Lenny is making, and their peculiar counterpoint helps Allen pull off some of the more clearly perfunctory plot developments. By the end of the movie, when the deus ex machina arrives from the sky in a helicopter, it feels like an stimulation rather than what it is, an expedient plot device. As Linda, then 29-year-old Mira Sorvino's voice is heavy Brooklyn lightened by helium and thus made comic, which mitigates the explicit casual vulgarity of her lexicon, making it seemingly na&iuml;ve. Her Oscar win has apparently been subject to the same "come-on's" and "gimme-a-break's" as Marisa Tomei's for My Cousin Vinny, perhaps because young bimbo roles, including those of Brooklyn spitfires, are often so two-dimensional, they're all taken for granted as precisely that. But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character. Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending. Feels like Woody's just treading water here, but even when it becomes unquestionably frivolous, Mighty Aphrodite remains an attractively made, swift, lighthearted dessert that transpires as pleasant mid-range Woody. He's best known for this spirit of romantic comedy, having transitioned from broad screwball to more storied and romantic films. Mighty Aphrodite, during his freshly post-Farrow period of varied sorts of works, is generally inclined at a gratifying and more or less reliable reading.

    Mighty Aphrodite is Woody Allen in a good mood; nice, considerate, thoughtful and completely engaging and delightful to watch. Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style. In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things: Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs. All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding. Life is a mysterious fig, and Woody Allen knows the best way to understand it is to laugh at its mysteries.

    Woody Allen is boon to Cinema. A blessed talent, a potential institution, who makes his cinema fun, with ease. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a yet another classic from this genius. Humor, Romance and emotions are brought out with flying colors. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is probably the funniest rom-com Allen attempted in the 90's. Allen plays a hen-picked husband, Helena Bonham Carter is his wife, who have adopted a son, who's mom is Sorvino. Allen adds in narrators in the name of F.Murray Abraham, and thus, starts this whacked-up journey. It's a terrific film, with a more-than-flawless culmination. Allen's direction & writing, as always, is perfect. I also loved Carlo Di Palma's Cinematography. In the acting department, Sorvino is marvelous. She deserved all the acclaim and awards she got! Allen is lovable. Undoubtedly, one of his best works. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the bossy wife. F.Murray Abraham is flawless as the lead narrator. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a must watch film. It's a winner all the way! Hence. from my side, Two Big Thumbs Up!

    This is a very enjoyable film that takes its premises from Greek tragedy; that is to say, the gods are really in charge. They are the apotheosis of happenstance. The mixture of good intentions and fundamental humanity are portrayed here. We all want the best as does Woody's character. Mara Sorvino proved to be quite a wonderful choice for the seemingly scatterbrained, but very wise other woman. The chorus is hilarious with its askance a commentary. It all plays out, and without giving anything away, manages to trick the mere mortals. Woody's sense of humor is at work all along as he gives up himself in the presence of a strong woman. Not a major film, but well worth seeing.

    Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Allen) and his wife (Bonham-Carter) adopt a baby from an anonymous mother. After a few years pass, Lenny starts to wonder about the woman. Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her. Lenny is dismayed, maybe even terrified, to find that Linda (Sorvino,) the mother, is a beautiful $200-an-hour prostitute. So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis,) who add their own unique take on the proceedings. I've always preferred Woody Allen's comedies over his dramas. This one is probably one of my favorites. This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin. The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever.

    This is a fine writing and storytelling by Woody Allen. It's actually clever and humorous, despite situations that could be serious. This movie goes in more of a light-hearted approach. With a bit of fate and ironic circumstances thrown in, that works well as a whole. Even if some of the humorous parts, rely on dense characters a bit too much. When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby. Later Woody Allen looks for his son's real mother, because of ulterior motives. And ends up controlling her, even if in his case he is doing it with mostly good intentions. But the ironic, clever, dense humors is blended in well and fits together with the story as a whole. Although it does get a bit self-indulgent at times. Mainly do to the fact that Woody Allen's character in this being the only rational or at least the smart one for the most part. While everyone around him is either naive or dense. Besides his self-conscious and imaginary sidekick. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and how it all played out. One of Woody Allen's good works. The term "the curiosity killed the cat" is a positive thing when it comes to this. And also one the best part about this movie is Mira Sorvino who just owns the role as Linda Ash. 7.6/10

Woody plays the leading male role (as well as writing and directing, unsurprisingly enough), a man named Lenny who finds himself the father of an adopted child when his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides that they should have a baby but also knows that they're both very busy people. A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path. With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of "reality" (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here. Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing. If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

    Woody is a realistic idealist, because to persist making contemplative films is to assert how buoyant you actually are. His buoyancy is not to be associated with that articulated by his more hopeful characters. The average rubrics of idealism and cynicism offer fertile readings of several of his later films. How best to support such analyses? The views to be favored are those that fall back neither on some proclamation of, or biographical facts about, the creator, nor to the partialities of the interpreter. Allen's work helps us sidestep both of these moves: the biographical myth and the reading of a connotation into the content instead of interpreting what it might have to say, because he presents the alternatives of optimism and pessimism in dramatic rather than discursive ways. This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism: It's worthwhile to carry on. This modern playing-up of Pygmalion divulges its solemn undercurrents, with observations by the Greek chorus, which periodically bursts into song and dance, while in unison developing a plot that lends itself to farce, Woody playing a sportswriter who's initially opposed to adopting a kid despite his career-driven wife Helena Bonham Carter being unable to get pregnant for the sake of her job, yet she has her way and they adopt a boy they call Max. As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart. Although the increasingly colloquial Greek chorus might sound like a cumbersome adjunct to a Woody Allen comedy about contemporary Manhattan neurotics, it truly works properly. Chorus members including F.

Her Oscar win has apparently been subject to the same "come-on's" and "gimme-a-break's" as Marisa Tomei's for My Cousin Vinny, perhaps because young bimbo roles, including those of Brooklyn spitfires, are often so two-dimensional, they're all taken for granted as precisely that. But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character. Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending.

    Mighty Aphrodite is Woody Allen in a good mood; nice, considerate, thoughtful and completely engaging and delightful to watch. Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style. In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things: Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs. All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding. Life is a mysterious fig, and Woody Allen knows the best way to understand it is to laugh at its mysteries.

    Woody Allen is boon to Cinema. A blessed talent, a potential institution, who makes his cinema fun, with ease. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a yet another classic from this genius. Humor, Romance and emotions are brought out with flying colors. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is probably the funniest rom-com Allen attempted in the 90's. Allen plays a hen-picked husband, Helena Bonham Carter is his wife, who have adopted a son, who's mom is Sorvino. Allen adds in narrators in the name of F.Murray Abraham, and thus, starts this whacked-up journey. It's a terrific film, with a more-than-flawless culmination. Allen's direction & writing, as always, is perfect. I also loved Carlo Di Palma's Cinematography. In the acting department, Sorvino is marvelous. She deserved all the acclaim and awards she got! Allen is lovable. Undoubtedly, one of his best works. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the bossy wife. F.Murray Abraham is flawless as the lead narrator. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a must watch film. It's a winner all the way! Hence. from my side, Two Big Thumbs Up!

    This is a very enjoyable film that takes its premises from Greek tragedy; that is to say, the gods are really in charge. They are the apotheosis of happenstance. The mixture of good intentions and fundamental humanity are portrayed here. We all want the best as does Woody's character. Mara Sorvino proved to be quite a wonderful choice for the seemingly scatterbrained, but very wise other woman. The chorus is hilarious with its askance a commentary. It all plays out, and without giving anything away, manages to trick the mere mortals. Woody's sense of humor is at work all along as he gives up himself in the presence of a strong woman. Not a major film, but well worth seeing.

    Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Allen) and his wife (Bonham-Carter) adopt a baby from an anonymous mother. After a few years pass, Lenny starts to wonder about the woman. Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her. Lenny is dismayed, maybe even terrified, to find that Linda (Sorvino,) the mother, is a beautiful $200-an-hour prostitute. So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis,) who add their own unique take on the proceedings. I've always preferred Woody Allen's comedies over his dramas. This one is probably one of my favorites. This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin. The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever.

    This is a fine writing and storytelling by Woody Allen. It's actually clever and humorous, despite situations that could be serious. This movie goes in more of a light-hearted approach. With a bit of fate and ironic circumstances thrown in, that works well as a whole. Even if some of the humorous parts, rely on dense characters a bit too much. When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby. Later Woody Allen looks for his son's real mother, because of ulterior motives. And ends up controlling her, even if in his case he is doing it with mostly good intentions. But the ironic, clever, dense humors is blended in well and fits together with the story as a whole. Although it does get a bit self-indulgent at times. Mainly do to the fact that Woody Allen's character in this being the only rational or at least the smart one for the most part. While everyone around him is either naive or dense. Besides his self-conscious and imaginary sidekick. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and how it all played out. One of Woody Allen's good works. The term "the curiosity killed the cat" is a positive thing when it comes to this. And also one the best part about this movie is Mira Sorvino who just owns the role as Linda Ash. 7.6/10

    Woody Allen stars in his latest picture that he also wrote and direct as Lenny, a New York sportswriter bored by his wife and attracted to a hooker that happens to be the mother-though she doesn't know it-of his adopted son in this film,Mighty Aphrodite.Together in the cast with Allen are Woody Allen,Mira Sorvino,Helena Bonham Carter,Michael Rapaport and F. Murray Abraham. Lenny is trapped in a bad marriage to high-strung art dealer Amanda, but he finds solace in his relationship with his adopted young son. Indeed, he grows so fond of the boy that he decides to track down the boy's real mother, expecting to discover a brilliant professional. Instead, he finds Linda, a ditzy prostitute and porno star who mingles casual vulgarity with disarming innocence. Despite his initial disillusionment, Lenny soon develops a fondness for Linda and decides to play matchmaker, setting her up with a handsome young boxer who is equally good-hearted and scatterbrained. While the contrast between the free-spirited Linda and the uptight Lenny provides the bulk of the laughs, hints of Allen's more literary humor are also present, particularly in the scenes involving a roaming Greek chorus commenting upon Lenny's fate. This is a surprisingly sweet and brilliant film with great performances particularly that from Mira Sorvino,who portrayed a bubble-headed hooker and porn star.It has a nice combination of smart comedy and some of wacky energy.It is a delight to watch.

    Since I madly ADORE Woody Allen films, it will be considered very biased and redundant of me to write a review for this film and fill it up with eulogies no end. But even so, after so many reviews, much earlier than mine (I just saw this film, having missed it I don't know why) and also much better than mine, I still want to say that I loved it, although I found it a rehash of some previous films of his, but the charm is there, New York is there, his characters are always meaty and in this case, Mira Sorvino creates a Tsunami of sorts with her 'Linda Ash' impersonation, as forceful a creation as the one given by Giulietta Massina, that unforgettable 'Gelsomina', for "La Strada", that Fellini masterpiece of yesteryear. To me, her interpretation is worth a TEN stars (not the film though) I didn't care much for the Greek Chorus... Could I have been prejudiced by the raggedy look of their costumes? they seemed to have been made with dirty dishcloths while the performers were waiting for them to be put together by rushed and long-suffering seamstresses, seating on those steps (here one seats and seats...) where they performed their musical numbers. If you saw a prehistoric movie: "Down to Earth" (1940s) with Rita Hayworth, the Choruses costumes were... HEAVENLY! These ones looked out of "The Planet of the Apes", Yuk! But in general it's a fun movie to watch.

    This is a modern fable, that is narrated and commented by a Greek chorus.Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib ends up adopting a boy, Max, with his wife Amanda.In a few years they start facing some problems in their marriage, and Lenny wants to know about Max' real mother.To his surprise she turns out to be a hooker/porn actress.He gets close to her as a client, but all he does is talk with her.At first, anyway.Mighty Aphrodite (1995) is a Woody Allen film, where he also plays the lead.And he does it with the Woody-like style.And, like in any Allen movie, the rest of the actors are A-list.Helena Bonham Carter is terrific as Amanda Sloan Weinrib.Mira Sorvino is pretty fantastic as Linda Ash.Michael Rapaport is great as her dumb date Kevin.Then there are superb people, like F. Murray Abraham as Greek Chorus Leader.Olympia Dukakis is Jocasta.David Ogden Stiers plays Laius.Jack Warden is the blind prophet, Tiresias.Danielle Ferland plays Cassandra.Peter Weller plays Jerry Bender.Donald Symington is Amanda's Father.Claire Bloom, who turned 80 earlier this year, is Amanda's Mother.Tony Sirico plays the part of Boxing Trainer.Paul Giamatti is seen as Extras Guild Researcher.This is quite amusing Woody Allen experience.It's quite hilarious when Linda uses that language known from her films with Lenny.And when Lenny talks with the Greek chorus people.For Woody Allen fans this movie gives what they expect from the man.And that is a comedy with some wit.

    In many ways Mighty Aphrodite is simply a piece of entertaining fluff dressed up with some of the standard Woody Allen neuroses (the path of true love not running smooth, the spark of passion, the yearning to make a mark) but in many other ways it's up there with some of his finest comedies. Woody plays the leading male role (as well as writing and directing, unsurprisingly enough), a man named Lenny who finds himself the father of an adopted child when his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides that they should have a baby but also knows that they're both very busy people. A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path. With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of "reality" (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here. Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing. If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

    A Swift, Lighthearted Antidote to Woody's Own Perceived Pessimism

    Woody is a realistic idealist, because to persist making contemplative films is to assert how buoyant you actually are. His buoyancy is not to be associated with that articulated by his more hopeful characters. The average rubrics of idealism and cynicism offer fertile readings of several of his later films. How best to support such analyses? The views to be favored are those that fall back neither on some proclamation of, or biographical facts about, the creator, nor to the partialities of the interpreter. Allen's work helps us sidestep both of these moves: the biographical myth and the reading of a connotation into the content instead of interpreting what it might have to say, because he presents the alternatives of optimism and pessimism in dramatic rather than discursive ways. This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism: It's worthwhile to carry on. This modern playing-up of Pygmalion divulges its solemn undercurrents, with observations by the Greek chorus, which periodically bursts into song and dance, while in unison developing a plot that lends itself to farce, Woody playing a sportswriter who's initially opposed to adopting a kid despite his career-driven wife Helena Bonham Carter being unable to get pregnant for the sake of her job, yet she has her way and they adopt a boy they call Max. As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart. Although the increasingly colloquial Greek chorus might sound like a cumbersome adjunct to a Woody Allen comedy about contemporary Manhattan neurotics, it truly works properly. Chorus members including F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis and David Ogden Stiers make urgent notes of the choices Lenny is making, and their peculiar counterpoint helps Allen pull off some of the more clearly perfunctory plot developments. By the end of the movie, when the deus ex machina arrives from the sky in a helicopter, it feels like an stimulation rather than what it is, an expedient plot device. As Linda, then 29-year-old Mira Sorvino's voice is heavy Brooklyn lightened by helium and thus made comic, which mitigates the explicit casual vulgarity of her lexicon, making it seemingly na&iuml;ve. Her Oscar win has apparently been subject to the same "come-on's" and "gimme-a-break's" as Marisa Tomei's for My Cousin Vinny, perhaps because young bimbo roles, including those of Brooklyn spitfires, are often so two-dimensional, they're all taken for granted as precisely that. But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character. Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending. Feels like Woody's just treading water here, but even when it becomes unquestionably frivolous, Mighty Aphrodite remains an attractively made, swift, lighthearted dessert that transpires as pleasant mid-range Woody. He's best known for this spirit of romantic comedy, having transitioned from broad screwball to more storied and romantic films. Mighty Aphrodite, during his freshly post-Farrow period of varied sorts of works, is generally inclined at a gratifying and more or less reliable reading.

    Mighty Aphrodite is Woody Allen in a good mood; nice, considerate, thoughtful and completely engaging and delightful to watch. Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style. In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things: Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs. All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding. Life is a mysterious fig, and Woody Allen knows the best way to understand it is to laugh at its mysteries.

Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her.

She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever.

    This is a fine writing and storytelling by Woody Allen. It's actually clever and humorous, despite situations that could be serious. This movie goes in more of a light-hearted approach. With a bit of fate and ironic circumstances thrown in, that works well as a whole. Even if some of the humorous parts, rely on dense characters a bit too much. When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby. Later Woody Allen looks for his son's real mother, because of ulterior motives. And ends up controlling her, even if in his case he is doing it with mostly good intentions. But the ironic, clever, dense humors is blended in well and fits together with the story as a whole. Although it does get a bit self-indulgent at times. Mainly do to the fact that Woody Allen's character in this being the only rational or at least the smart one for the most part. While everyone around him is either naive or dense. Besides his self-conscious and imaginary sidekick. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and how it all played out. One of Woody Allen's good works. The term "the curiosity killed the cat" is a positive thing when it comes to this. And also one the best part about this movie is Mira Sorvino who just owns the role as Linda Ash. 7.6/10

Murray Abraham as Greek Chorus Leader.Olympia Dukakis is Jocasta.David Ogden Stiers plays Laius.Jack Warden is the blind prophet, Tiresias.Danielle Ferland plays Cassandra.Peter Weller plays Jerry Bender.Donald Symington is Amanda's Father.Claire Bloom, who turned 80 earlier this year, is Amanda's Mother.Tony Sirico plays the part of Boxing Trainer.Paul Giamatti is seen as Extras Guild Researcher.This is quite amusing Woody Allen experience.It's quite hilarious when Linda uses that language known from her films with Lenny.And when Lenny talks with the Greek chorus people.For Woody Allen fans this movie gives what they expect from the man.And that is a comedy with some wit.

    In many ways Mighty Aphrodite is simply a piece of entertaining fluff dressed up with some of the standard Woody Allen neuroses (the path of true love not running smooth, the spark of passion, the yearning to make a mark) but in many other ways it's up there with some of his finest comedies. Woody plays the leading male role (as well as writing and directing, unsurprisingly enough), a man named Lenny who finds himself the father of an adopted child when his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides that they should have a baby but also knows that they're both very busy people. A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path. With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of "reality" (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here. Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing. If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

    A Swift, Lighthearted Antidote to Woody's Own Perceived Pessimism

    Woody is a realistic idealist, because to persist making contemplative films is to assert how buoyant you actually are. His buoyancy is not to be associated with that articulated by his more hopeful characters. The average rubrics of idealism and cynicism offer fertile readings of several of his later films. How best to support such analyses? The views to be favored are those that fall back neither on some proclamation of, or biographical facts about, the creator, nor to the partialities of the interpreter. Allen's work helps us sidestep both of these moves: the biographical myth and the reading of a connotation into the content instead of interpreting what it might have to say, because he presents the alternatives of optimism and pessimism in dramatic rather than discursive ways. This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism: It's worthwhile to carry on. This modern playing-up of Pygmalion divulges its solemn undercurrents, with observations by the Greek chorus, which periodically bursts into song and dance, while in unison developing a plot that lends itself to farce, Woody playing a sportswriter who's initially opposed to adopting a kid despite his career-driven wife Helena Bonham Carter being unable to get pregnant for the sake of her job, yet she has her way and they adopt a boy they call Max. As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart. Although the increasingly colloquial Greek chorus might sound like a cumbersome adjunct to a Woody Allen comedy about contemporary Manhattan neurotics, it truly works properly. Chorus members including F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis and David Ogden Stiers make urgent notes of the choices Lenny is making, and their peculiar counterpoint helps Allen pull off some of the more clearly perfunctory plot developments. By the end of the movie, when the deus ex machina arrives from the sky in a helicopter, it feels like an stimulation rather than what it is, an expedient plot device. As Linda, then 29-year-old Mira Sorvino's voice is heavy Brooklyn lightened by helium and thus made comic, which mitigates the explicit casual vulgarity of her lexicon, making it seemingly na&iuml;ve. Her Oscar win has apparently been subject to the same "come-on's" and "gimme-a-break's" as Marisa Tomei's for My Cousin Vinny, perhaps because young bimbo roles, including those of Brooklyn spitfires, are often so two-dimensional, they're all taken for granted as precisely that. But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character. Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending. Feels like Woody's just treading water here, but even when it becomes unquestionably frivolous, Mighty Aphrodite remains an attractively made, swift, lighthearted dessert that transpires as pleasant mid-range Woody. He's best known for this spirit of romantic comedy, having transitioned from broad screwball to more storied and romantic films. Mighty Aphrodite, during his freshly post-Farrow period of varied sorts of works, is generally inclined at a gratifying and more or less reliable reading.

    Mighty Aphrodite is Woody Allen in a good mood; nice, considerate, thoughtful and completely engaging and delightful to watch. Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style. In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things: Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs. All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding. Life is a mysterious fig, and Woody Allen knows the best way to understand it is to laugh at its mysteries.

    Woody Allen is boon to Cinema. A blessed talent, a potential institution, who makes his cinema fun, with ease. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a yet another classic from this genius. Humor, Romance and emotions are brought out with flying colors. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is probably the funniest rom-com Allen attempted in the 90's. Allen plays a hen-picked husband, Helena Bonham Carter is his wife, who have adopted a son, who's mom is Sorvino. Allen adds in narrators in the name of F.Murray Abraham, and thus, starts this whacked-up journey. It's a terrific film, with a more-than-flawless culmination. Allen's direction & writing, as always, is perfect. I also loved Carlo Di Palma's Cinematography. In the acting department, Sorvino is marvelous. She deserved all the acclaim and awards she got! Allen is lovable. Undoubtedly, one of his best works. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the bossy wife. F.Murray Abraham is flawless as the lead narrator. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a must watch film. It's a winner all the way! Hence. from my side, Two Big Thumbs Up!

    This is a very enjoyable film that takes its premises from Greek tragedy; that is to say, the gods are really in charge. They are the apotheosis of happenstance. The mixture of good intentions and fundamental humanity are portrayed here. We all want the best as does Woody's character. Mara Sorvino proved to be quite a wonderful choice for the seemingly scatterbrained, but very wise other woman. The chorus is hilarious with its askance a commentary. It all plays out, and without giving anything away, manages to trick the mere mortals. Woody's sense of humor is at work all along as he gives up himself in the presence of a strong woman. Not a major film, but well worth seeing.

    Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Allen) and his wife (Bonham-Carter) adopt a baby from an anonymous mother. After a few years pass, Lenny starts to wonder about the woman. Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her. Lenny is dismayed, maybe even terrified, to find that Linda (Sorvino,) the mother, is a beautiful $200-an-hour prostitute. So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis,) who add their own unique take on the proceedings. I've always preferred Woody Allen's comedies over his dramas. This one is probably one of my favorites. This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin. The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever.

    This is a fine writing and storytelling by Woody Allen. It's actually clever and humorous, despite situations that could be serious. This movie goes in more of a light-hearted approach. With a bit of fate and ironic circumstances thrown in, that works well as a whole. Even if some of the humorous parts, rely on dense characters a bit too much. When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby. Later Woody Allen looks for his son's real mother, because of ulterior motives. And ends up controlling her, even if in his case he is doing it with mostly good intentions. But the ironic, clever, dense humors is blended in well and fits together with the story as a whole. Although it does get a bit self-indulgent at times. Mainly do to the fact that Woody Allen's character in this being the only rational or at least the smart one for the most part. While everyone around him is either naive or dense. Besides his self-conscious and imaginary sidekick. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and how it all played out. One of Woody Allen's good works. The term "the curiosity killed the cat" is a positive thing when it comes to this. And also one the best part about this movie is Mira Sorvino who just owns the role as Linda Ash. 7.6/10

    Woody Allen stars in his latest picture that he also wrote and direct as Lenny, a New York sportswriter bored by his wife and attracted to a hooker that happens to be the mother-though she doesn't know it-of his adopted son in this film,Mighty Aphrodite.Together in the cast with Allen are Woody Allen,Mira Sorvino,Helena Bonham Carter,Michael Rapaport and F. Murray Abraham. Lenny is trapped in a bad marriage to high-strung art dealer Amanda, but he finds solace in his relationship with his adopted young son. Indeed, he grows so fond of the boy that he decides to track down the boy's real mother, expecting to discover a brilliant professional. Instead, he finds Linda, a ditzy prostitute and porno star who mingles casual vulgarity with disarming innocence. Despite his initial disillusionment, Lenny soon develops a fondness for Linda and decides to play matchmaker, setting her up with a handsome young boxer who is equally good-hearted and scatterbrained. While the contrast between the free-spirited Linda and the uptight Lenny provides the bulk of the laughs, hints of Allen's more literary humor are also present, particularly in the scenes involving a roaming Greek chorus commenting upon Lenny's fate. This is a surprisingly sweet and brilliant film with great performances particularly that from Mira Sorvino,who portrayed a bubble-headed hooker and porn star.It has a nice combination of smart comedy and some of wacky energy.It is a delight to watch.

    Since I madly ADORE Woody Allen films, it will be considered very biased and redundant of me to write a review for this film and fill it up with eulogies no end. But even so, after so many reviews, much earlier than mine (I just saw this film, having missed it I don't know why) and also much better than mine, I still want to say that I loved it, although I found it a rehash of some previous films of his, but the charm is there, New York is there, his characters are always meaty and in this case, Mira Sorvino creates a Tsunami of sorts with her 'Linda Ash' impersonation, as forceful a creation as the one given by Giulietta Massina, that unforgettable 'Gelsomina', for "La Strada", that Fellini masterpiece of yesteryear. To me, her interpretation is worth a TEN stars (not the film though) I didn't care much for the Greek Chorus... Could I have been prejudiced by the raggedy look of their costumes? they seemed to have been made with dirty dishcloths while the performers were waiting for them to be put together by rushed and long-suffering seamstresses, seating on those steps (here one seats and seats...) where they performed their musical numbers. If you saw a prehistoric movie: "Down to Earth" (1940s) with Rita Hayworth, the Choruses costumes were... HEAVENLY! These ones looked out of "The Planet of the Apes", Yuk! But in general it's a fun movie to watch.

    In many ways Mighty Aphrodite is simply a piece of entertaining fluff dressed up with some of the standard Woody Allen neuroses (the path of true love not running smooth, the spark of passion, the yearning to make a mark) but in many other ways it's up there with some of his finest comedies. Woody plays the leading male role (as well as writing and directing, unsurprisingly enough), a man named Lenny who finds himself the father of an adopted child when his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides that they should have a baby but also knows that they're both very busy people. A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path. With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of "reality" (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here. Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing. If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

    Woody is a realistic idealist, because to persist making contemplative films is to assert how buoyant you actually are. His buoyancy is not to be associated with that articulated by his more hopeful characters. The average rubrics of idealism and cynicism offer fertile readings of several of his later films. How best to support such analyses? The views to be favored are those that fall back neither on some proclamation of, or biographical facts about, the creator, nor to the partialities of the interpreter. Allen's work helps us sidestep both of these moves: the biographical myth and the reading of a connotation into the content instead of interpreting what it might have to say, because he presents the alternatives of optimism and pessimism in dramatic rather than discursive ways. This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism: It's worthwhile to carry on.

As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart.

But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character. Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending.

    Mighty Aphrodite is Woody Allen in a good mood; nice, considerate, thoughtful and completely engaging and delightful to watch. Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style. In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things: Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs. All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding. Life is a mysterious fig, and Woody Allen knows the best way to understand it is to laugh at its mysteries.

Humor, Romance and emotions are brought out with flying colors. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is probably the funniest rom-com Allen attempted in the 90's. Allen plays a hen-picked husband, Helena Bonham Carter is his wife, who have adopted a son, who's mom is Sorvino. Allen adds in narrators in the name of F.Murray Abraham, and thus, starts this whacked-up journey. It's a terrific film, with a more-than-flawless culmination. Allen's direction & writing, as always, is perfect. I also loved Carlo Di Palma's Cinematography. In the acting department, Sorvino is marvelous. She deserved all the acclaim and awards she got! Allen is lovable. Undoubtedly, one of his best works. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the bossy wife. F.Murray Abraham is flawless as the lead narrator. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a must watch film.

Not a major film, but well worth seeing.

    Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib (Allen) and his wife (Bonham-Carter) adopt a baby from an anonymous mother. After a few years pass, Lenny starts to wonder about the woman. Curiosity quickly gets the better of him, so he steals files from the adoption agency and sets out to find her. Lenny is dismayed, maybe even terrified, to find that Linda (Sorvino,) the mother, is a beautiful $200-an-hour prostitute. So that he can fashion the proper mother-son reunion and save himself from what fate seems to have in store, he determines to 'reform' Linda. Interwoven throughout the story is a Greek chorus (including F. Murray Abraham and Olympia Dukakis,) who add their own unique take on the proceedings. I've always preferred Woody Allen's comedies over his dramas. This one is probably one of my favorites. This film is a great example of Woody Allen showing no interest in convincing his audience into swallowing down some serious morals. It's light, fluffy, shamelessly sentimental and does not suffer a bit because of it. The plot is generally an uplifting tale of changing ones life for the better, and intertwined with this is some of Woody Allen's best humor. There are many entertaining characters, especially Mira Sorvino's prostitute and Michael Rapaport's dim-witted boxer, Kevin. The stand-out here is Mira Sorvino. She is absolutely enthralling, with her ditsy nature and confidence masking a timid vulnerability, all of which earned her a well deserved Oscar. Linda could have been an over the top, cartoonish character, Pygmalion on crack. But under the careful direction of Allen, Sorvino gives the best performance of her career so far, and one of the funniest performances ever.

    This is a fine writing and storytelling by Woody Allen. It's actually clever and humorous, despite situations that could be serious. This movie goes in more of a light-hearted approach. With a bit of fate and ironic circumstances thrown in, that works well as a whole. Even if some of the humorous parts, rely on dense characters a bit too much. When it comes to the ironic direction of the characters. Woody Allen plays this husband that is with a controlling wife that decides to adopt a baby. Later Woody Allen looks for his son's real mother, because of ulterior motives. And ends up controlling her, even if in his case he is doing it with mostly good intentions. But the ironic, clever, dense humors is blended in well and fits together with the story as a whole. Although it does get a bit self-indulgent at times. Mainly do to the fact that Woody Allen's character in this being the only rational or at least the smart one for the most part. While everyone around him is either naive or dense. Besides his self-conscious and imaginary sidekick. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and how it all played out. One of Woody Allen's good works. The term "the curiosity killed the cat" is a positive thing when it comes to this. And also one the best part about this movie is Mira Sorvino who just owns the role as Linda Ash. 7.6/10

    Woody Allen stars in his latest picture that he also wrote and direct as Lenny, a New York sportswriter bored by his wife and attracted to a hooker that happens to be the mother-though she doesn't know it-of his adopted son in this film,Mighty Aphrodite.Together in the cast with Allen are Woody Allen,Mira Sorvino,Helena Bonham Carter,Michael Rapaport and F. Murray Abraham. Lenny is trapped in a bad marriage to high-strung art dealer Amanda, but he finds solace in his relationship with his adopted young son. Indeed, he grows so fond of the boy that he decides to track down the boy's real mother, expecting to discover a brilliant professional. Instead, he finds Linda, a ditzy prostitute and porno star who mingles casual vulgarity with disarming innocence. Despite his initial disillusionment, Lenny soon develops a fondness for Linda and decides to play matchmaker, setting her up with a handsome young boxer who is equally good-hearted and scatterbrained. While the contrast between the free-spirited Linda and the uptight Lenny provides the bulk of the laughs, hints of Allen's more literary humor are also present, particularly in the scenes involving a roaming Greek chorus commenting upon Lenny's fate. This is a surprisingly sweet and brilliant film with great performances particularly that from Mira Sorvino,who portrayed a bubble-headed hooker and porn star.It has a nice combination of smart comedy and some of wacky energy.It is a delight to watch.

    Since I madly ADORE Woody Allen films, it will be considered very biased and redundant of me to write a review for this film and fill it up with eulogies no end. But even so, after so many reviews, much earlier than mine (I just saw this film, having missed it I don't know why) and also much better than mine, I still want to say that I loved it, although I found it a rehash of some previous films of his, but the charm is there, New York is there, his characters are always meaty and in this case, Mira Sorvino creates a Tsunami of sorts with her 'Linda Ash' impersonation, as forceful a creation as the one given by Giulietta Massina, that unforgettable 'Gelsomina', for "La Strada", that Fellini masterpiece of yesteryear. To me, her interpretation is worth a TEN stars (not the film though) I didn't care much for the Greek Chorus... Could I have been prejudiced by the raggedy look of their costumes? they seemed to have been made with dirty dishcloths while the performers were waiting for them to be put together by rushed and long-suffering seamstresses, seating on those steps (here one seats and seats...) where they performed their musical numbers. If you saw a prehistoric movie: "Down to Earth" (1940s) with Rita Hayworth, the Choruses costumes were... HEAVENLY! These ones looked out of "The Planet of the Apes", Yuk! But in general it's a fun movie to watch.

    This is a modern fable, that is narrated and commented by a Greek chorus.Sportswriter Lenny Weinrib ends up adopting a boy, Max, with his wife Amanda.In a few years they start facing some problems in their marriage, and Lenny wants to know about Max' real mother.To his surprise she turns out to be a hooker/porn actress.He gets close to her as a client, but all he does is talk with her.At first, anyway.Mighty Aphrodite (1995) is a Woody Allen film, where he also plays the lead.And he does it with the Woody-like style.And, like in any Allen movie, the rest of the actors are A-list.Helena Bonham Carter is terrific as Amanda Sloan Weinrib.Mira Sorvino is pretty fantastic as Linda Ash.Michael Rapaport is great as her dumb date Kevin.Then there are superb people, like F. Murray Abraham as Greek Chorus Leader.Olympia Dukakis is Jocasta.David Ogden Stiers plays Laius.Jack Warden is the blind prophet, Tiresias.Danielle Ferland plays Cassandra.Peter Weller plays Jerry Bender.Donald Symington is Amanda's Father.Claire Bloom, who turned 80 earlier this year, is Amanda's Mother.Tony Sirico plays the part of Boxing Trainer.Paul Giamatti is seen as Extras Guild Researcher.This is quite amusing Woody Allen experience.It's quite hilarious when Linda uses that language known from her films with Lenny.And when Lenny talks with the Greek chorus people.For Woody Allen fans this movie gives what they expect from the man.And that is a comedy with some wit.

    In many ways Mighty Aphrodite is simply a piece of entertaining fluff dressed up with some of the standard Woody Allen neuroses (the path of true love not running smooth, the spark of passion, the yearning to make a mark) but in many other ways it's up there with some of his finest comedies. Woody plays the leading male role (as well as writing and directing, unsurprisingly enough), a man named Lenny who finds himself the father of an adopted child when his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides that they should have a baby but also knows that they're both very busy people. A few years down the line, with passion faded and life out of balance somehow, Lenny thinks it may be time to find out just who the real mother of his son is and the trail leads him down an unexpected path. With a full, masked Greek chorus playing around in between moments of "reality" (and, occasionally, one or two of the players pop up to help or hinder Lenny in his quest) it's obvious that Allen still likes to make his work appealing to those who keep their brain switched on but the character of Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino in an Oscar-winning turn), an aspiring actress and happy hooker, will appeal to everyone and allows Allen to use some choice selections of bawdy gags so it looks like our neurotic New Yorker can get the best of both worlds here. Which is kinda the problem. This is a movie all about a couple who decided to get themselves a baby and then one of them starts giving it some real thought when things have gone too far. Then there's the obvious complications that arise as Lenny finds Linda to be quite a warm, loving gal. Could he be tempted to stray? If he does then that's okay because his wife is being actively pursued by another man (Peter Weller) anyway. Which justifies the whole thing. If you don't think about everything TOO much then the whole thing is enjoyable, funny and a pretty feelgood film but if you DO think about everything beyond just what's on the surface then there's a lot here that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Considering that Allen likes his audience to think makes it harder to pinpoint exactly what he was aiming for. Yet I still can't help really liking the whole thing.

    A Swift, Lighthearted Antidote to Woody's Own Perceived Pessimism

    Woody is a realistic idealist, because to persist making contemplative films is to assert how buoyant you actually are. His buoyancy is not to be associated with that articulated by his more hopeful characters. The average rubrics of idealism and cynicism offer fertile readings of several of his later films. How best to support such analyses? The views to be favored are those that fall back neither on some proclamation of, or biographical facts about, the creator, nor to the partialities of the interpreter. Allen's work helps us sidestep both of these moves: the biographical myth and the reading of a connotation into the content instead of interpreting what it might have to say, because he presents the alternatives of optimism and pessimism in dramatic rather than discursive ways. This enables him to be detached from positions held in the material, clear in his practice of the drama of knowledge shared by the audience but not by all of the characters. It makes the assertion that getting on with one's life is a remedy for pessimism. Thus realistic idealism: It's worthwhile to carry on. This modern playing-up of Pygmalion divulges its solemn undercurrents, with observations by the Greek chorus, which periodically bursts into song and dance, while in unison developing a plot that lends itself to farce, Woody playing a sportswriter who's initially opposed to adopting a kid despite his career-driven wife Helena Bonham Carter being unable to get pregnant for the sake of her job, yet she has her way and they adopt a boy they call Max. As Max gets older, it becomes clear he's exceedingly gifted, and Woody becomes preoccupied with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After some tense scenes of farcical suspense, Lenny finally locates Max's mother, Linda, call girl and part-time porn actress. Lenny, never disclosing his real reason for seeking out Linda, swiftly becomes her friend and counselor, and sets about finding a nice guy for her to marry. Lenny recommends a young boxer he knows, a potato farmer from upstate, who is a good kid but not very smart. Although the increasingly colloquial Greek chorus might sound like a cumbersome adjunct to a Woody Allen comedy about contemporary Manhattan neurotics, it truly works properly. Chorus members including F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis and David Ogden Stiers make urgent notes of the choices Lenny is making, and their peculiar counterpoint helps Allen pull off some of the more clearly perfunctory plot developments. By the end of the movie, when the deus ex machina arrives from the sky in a helicopter, it feels like an stimulation rather than what it is, an expedient plot device. As Linda, then 29-year-old Mira Sorvino's voice is heavy Brooklyn lightened by helium and thus made comic, which mitigates the explicit casual vulgarity of her lexicon, making it seemingly na&iuml;ve. Her Oscar win has apparently been subject to the same "come-on's" and "gimme-a-break's" as Marisa Tomei's for My Cousin Vinny, perhaps because young bimbo roles, including those of Brooklyn spitfires, are often so two-dimensional, they're all taken for granted as precisely that. But known for being remarkably dignified and eloquent, Sorvino goes way outside the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold peripherals of the part in developing a genuinely sensitive and charming character. Through events that I won't divulge, Woody brings us to an addendum set a few years later, when Lenny and Linda meet again, and there is a bittersweet development in both of their lives, although each of them is conscious of only half of it. The movie's closing scene is calmly, pleasingly poignant, and the whole movie avoids the snags of pessimism and becomes something the Greeks could never completely handle, an impending tragedy with a hopeful ending. Feels like Woody's just treading water here, but even when it becomes unquestionably frivolous, Mighty Aphrodite remains an attractively made, swift, lighthearted dessert that transpires as pleasant mid-range Woody. He's best known for this spirit of romantic comedy, having transitioned from broad screwball to more storied and romantic films. Mighty Aphrodite, during his freshly post-Farrow period of varied sorts of works, is generally inclined at a gratifying and more or less reliable reading.

    Mighty Aphrodite is Woody Allen in a good mood; nice, considerate, thoughtful and completely engaging and delightful to watch. Taking major themes from Greek tragedies such as troubles of relationships and parenthood, Allen constructs here a tale that spins a story with its roots in Ancient Greek theater while maintaining his vintage Manhattan style. In true Greek form, Allen plays a writer who adopts a son with his wife and after finding out how gifted the boy is begins to track down his parents. He soon comes across the mother, a prostitute and porn star named Linda Ash who is sensitive, quick-witted, very charming and extremely attractive. It is in these scenes that we quickly realize two things: Mira Sorvino is a delightful actress and her casting was a thing of genius, and Woody Allen continues to prove his hold on the title as best comedic screenwriter in American cinema. His dialogue is so clever and quirky, the characters wildly screwball yet utterly charming; he is a one of a kind. He also shows his ability as a director, utilizing these scenes to build on more comedic opportunities as well as show his philosophy of how life often throws unbelievable curveballs. All throughout this delightful story, a Greek chorus pops up routinely to comment and enlarge the story and explain more on what Allen is trying to say. F. Murray Abraham is terrific as the sarcastic leader and the whole chorus has some great lines and the choreography is wonderful. Some will criticize this move, thinking it stops the flow of the film. In terms of Allen's career, I found it refreshing to see that at this point in his career, he found a new way to hook an audience as well as continue to tell an interesting and entertaining story. I also must comment on the final 10 minutes, which is equal parts tragedy, comedy, irony and understanding. Life is a mysterious fig, and Woody Allen knows the best way to understand it is to laugh at its mysteries.

    Woody Allen is boon to Cinema. A blessed talent, a potential institution, who makes his cinema fun, with ease. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a yet another classic from this genius. Humor, Romance and emotions are brought out with flying colors. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is probably the funniest rom-com Allen attempted in the 90's. Allen plays a hen-picked husband, Helena Bonham Carter is his wife, who have adopted a son, who's mom is Sorvino. Allen adds in narrators in the name of F.Murray Abraham, and thus, starts this whacked-up journey. It's a terrific film, with a more-than-flawless culmination. Allen's direction & writing, as always, is perfect. I also loved Carlo Di Palma's Cinematography. In the acting department, Sorvino is marvelous. She deserved all the acclaim and awards she got! Allen is lovable. Undoubtedly, one of his best works. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the bossy wife. F.Murray Abraham is flawless as the lead narrator. 'Mighty Aphrodite' is a must watch film. It's a winner all the way! Hence. from my side, Two Big Thumbs Up!

    This is a very enjoyable film that takes its premises from Greek tragedy; that is to say, the gods are really in charge. They are the apotheosis of happenstance. The mixture of good intentions and fundamental humanity are portrayed here. We all want the best as does Woody's character. Mara Sorvino proved to be quite a wonderful choice for the seemingly scatterbrained, but very wise other woman. The chorus is hilarious with its askance a commentary. It all plays out, and without giving anything away, manages to trick the mere mortals. Woody's sense of humor is at work all along as he gives up himself in the presence of a strong woman. Not a major film, but well worth seeing.
