    After watching "The Hudsucker Proxy" again, and reading Roger Ebert's review (again), I lamentably admit that I'm totally out of words. The film is so incongruously appealing that I feel my review should match the same level of creativeness and wonder it brought on the screen. But seriously, what more can I say about the Coen brothers' "The Hudsucker Proxy" that it's one of the best-looking comedies ever. There are many moments in the film, (in fact, quite every time) where I felt myself wondering if I had to keep track on the story or my eyes on the dazzling looks it offered: from the beautiful panoramic shots of majestic and creepy Babel-Tower like skyscrapers or the sumptuous recreation of the Big Corporations' inside rooms with never-ending tables as vertiginous as the buildings, from a horizontal perspective. Roger Deakins' geometric cinematography is absolutely breath-taking and rather than being put for the only 'eye-pleasing' purpose, works as the setting of some spectacular scenes. The most notable one is the opening where the respected President, Waring Hudsucker, played by the late Charles Durning, decides to make the big dive, fed up of all that business mumbo-jumbo he had to endure his all life. That long jump and long is an understatement (Hudsucker even finds time to tell people on the ground to move away), is weirdly convincing and hilarious through the anticlimactic slap at the end, the obligatory fat-ugly woman screaming and the verbal aftermath carried by heartless board members and their ruthless leader, Sidney Mussburger, played by Paul Newman. The jump scene sums up the film's appeal: it looks great and makes you laugh. And naturally, if you're a fan of Frank Capra's classics where greedy corporate businessman use a naive and idealistic schmuck to fulfill some evil schemes, and all the subsequent archetypes: spinning closes-up on newspapers headlines, nosy and noisy journalists and the snappy wisecracking workaholic female who'll get infatuated on the goodhearted fool she investigates on (Tim Robbins is perfect as the well-meaning Norville Barnes), comic-reliefs sidekicks and all that stuff, well, if you look at Hollywood Golden Age with nostalgic eyes, "The Hudsucker Proxy" will be familiar territory for you. And that Capraesque touch clearly helps to appreciate the film. Indeed, that half-homage and half-parody approach constitutes a solid platform on which the improbability of the story can efficiently evolve. And for some strange reasons, to which the Coen brothers only know the secret, each actor, by playing his character in the required over-the-top way, gave them that touch of believability for the film's bizarre poetry. I concede it takes time to get into some characters, I for once, thought Jennifer Lason Leigh was unbearable as the journalist, now, I can't see how her performance could have worked differently. The point is not that she impersonated Katharine Hepburn or Rosalind Russell well or badly, but that she was 'impersonating'. It's a film firmly aware of its 'cinematicality'. Naturally, the film isn't beyond criticism for all that. Many would argue that its very attention to great designs and magnificent looking details give a touch of seriousness inducing more serious expectations regarding the plot. My agreement with Ebert concerns the way the poster spoiled what would have been one hell of a middle-plot twist. I'm talking of course of the circle that would be revealed as the hula-hoop. That basic circle, Norville Barnes showed to everyone, adding the repeated line "You know, for kids" as if it was supposed to give a clue, could have been the film's McGuffin since it's the very device that triggers Mussburger's desire to hire Barnes as the proxy, in order to depress the stock and buys all the company's interests, but what a great surprise it would have been to have that revealed in the middle of the film. Apart from that missed opportunity, the film works and never leaves any hint of a dramatic evolution of the story. And when drama, there is, it only plays as set-ups from some screwball situations, the opening with Norville Barnes trying to jump from the Hudsucker's high clock is a reminiscence of John Doe's character (Gary Cooper) in "Meet John Doe", but I defy anyone to claim that he saw the resolution coming. Not to say that it would satisfy all the viewers, but still, it fits the film's surrealistic touch to the film, with all flash and style, but not without substance. Granted "The Hudsucker Proxy" isn't "Metropolis", "The Crowd" or "Brazil" but by its stylistic recreation of these iconic setting, leverage our thoughts to the more satirical material. Maybe it's too far-fetched, but I didn't think the film needed to speak explicit statement against savage capitalism; the point is smoothly made without distracting from the slapstick and screwball material. The assumption of 'all flash and no substance' isn't totally irrelevant but with such flashy brilliance and such great dialogs, the film can't be branded as unsubstantial. It's classy, surrealist, and funny and much more, it succeeds to put all these qualities together, something a few films can pretend to achieve. And on a more basic level, the film is so damn funny. I laughed, I laughed a lot. Maybe not as much as in the first act, but the laughs were equally combined with true satire and a dazzling photography, served by superb performances. The film works both on the surface and its content. I wish I could say more, I wish my vocabulary would be richer, but all I can do is summarize the film by paraphrasing its repeated line "you know, for laughs" That's what it is, a movie made for laughs, and the rest is just a delightful cinematic experience, something fresh made out of familiar material. Basically, the Coen brothers did the same than Norville Barnes: they reinvented the wheel.

    It is two weeks before the New Year of 1959. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) has arrived in New York City looking for a job after his graduation from college in Muncie, Indiana. With no working experience, he found himself working at the mailroom of the Hudsucker Industries. On the same day, the company's founder and president Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) unexpectedly committed suicide by jumping off from the top-floor window despite the company had been doing well financially. Back at the mailroom, there is the arrival of the 'Blue Letter' which Barnes had been assigned to hand it personally to Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), a member of the board of directors. When Barnes did eventually meet Mussburger, he would forget about the letter he was supposed to deliver and began talking about the new invention he had for the company. Mussburger would eventually decide to let Barnes become the replacement for Hudsucker, acting as the proxy where the company's stock would deflate at the appointment of an inexperienced and incompetent president. Across town, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist for the Manhattan Argus had successfully gone undercover working as a personal secretary for Barnes, pretending to be another desperate graduate from Muncie. In actual fact, she was assigned to do a profile of Barnes. Along the way, she would come to see how Barnes had been transformed as a person after his idea of the hula hoop take off across the country, going against what Mussburger and the board had thought the invention would depress the company stock. This can be seen as a film of about reversal of fortunes, of how Barnes went from the mailroom clerk to the company president and how he nearly went back to how it all started for him before being saved by an unlikely source. It is what would happen towards the ending which brings one full circle of what happened at the beginning of the film. Overall, it is a fairly enjoyable film, if one likes to root for the underdog which in this case is Barnes with the exception of what happened when the hula hoop invention changed his fortune.

    I have seen The Hud a half dozen times and it never gets old. From the opening sequence to the closing musical score this film keeps me enraptured. The art directing, the costumes, the music, the script all work together to make a movie of unprecedented beauty. Tim Robbins is perfect in this role and the supporting cast all come off the screen as unforgettable characters I proudly tell anyone who asks that this is my favorite film of all times. Sure, sure, art is subjective and some people do not care for such films. I feel sorry for them. This is a perfect film.

    I love the Coen brothers, and being a lesser Coen brother movie is hard, because all there others are so dang brilliant. The Hudsucker Proxy is a prime example of this. It's a good, funny movie, but watching it in the line-up the most the Coen brothers' other work, it's just a little weak. There are some great things about this flick though, for example the cinematography and visual look of the movie is totally awesome, and I really liked the film's premise/themes. The only thing I really didn't care for in this movie was Jennifer Jason Leigh... her character was annoying to me. The Hudsucker Proxy is definitely worth watching, and if you're a hardcore fan of the Coen brothers like myself, I think you'll enjoy and appreciate this underrated gem.

    It fills me with really great satisfaction to see such an excellently made and acted movie. Every word, scene, prop, and symbol are perfectly blended into one great awesome package. It's incredibly funny, a as matter of fact it has one of the longest funny scenes I have ever seen in my life, and not a word is spoken in it. Kudos to everyone in this film, directing is amazing, the visualization magnificent. It's hilarious, yet thoughtful, morally uplifting, educational, proves a very valid point, and was released in 1994. I want to thank my friend for watching it with me immediately upon learning that I had not seen it before. Simply, wow and a whole lot of whohohohohohahahahahhaohohohoho!!!!!........

    I am not really sure what is it about this movie that makes it so addictive and lovable. I've seen it many times and sometimes I just listen to it and always enjoyed it. I believe this is a kind of movie which only can be made by ones who really love cinema, you know someone like Tornatore, and I think Cohen brothers are those kind of people. The movie seems so perfect to me that I can't find even one negative point. It really makes me wonder how come a movie which didn't grab much attention and was considered a box office bomb could be otherwise a master piece. This movie is certainly among the top 5 best movies I've ever seen!

    I usually like the Cohen brothers movies and I know how they like to make unusual screw ball type comedy but this one was just too over the top for me. I know if was supposed to be that was and it was supposed to be campy but just not my style. Its like a serious movie thats made for little kids it almost seems. It seems a like a movie on YTV or something. This movie is about a college graduate on the lowest end of a huge corporation. The copration hatches this plan to hire a new CEO and make sure hes very dumb so the company stock falls. They want to do this so they can afford all the stock to themselvs. This movie was not all bad but one of the worst Cohen brothers movies and that pains me to say because I am a huge fan of Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou and No country for Old men. If you like quirky comedies this one you will like or if you just love the humor of the Cohen brothers and if you do you know it.

    The Coen Brothers' reputation for stylistic excess was never as well earned as here. Obviously aiming for the feel of a Preston Sturges classic comedy, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a stridently acted, indifferently written display of cinematic excess. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) lands in New York City just off the bus from Muncie, Indiana, looking for a job. Just as he gives up hope, a job literally falls from the sky, that of chief executive of cash-loaded Hudsucker Industries. Its CEO/Founder Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) "merges with the infinite" by taking a header from the 44th floor, leaving his board with a lot of precious loose stock to claim. Board member Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) decides the best solution is to bring the stock price down, quick, and grab up what the market dumps. "Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue," Mussburger sneers. "What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder." After Barnes nearly sets fire to Mussburger's office, the old snake figures he's found just the guy. Newman's unique here in that he doesn't spit out his lines rapid-fire out of the side of his mouth like William Demarest with lockjaw or any of Newman's castmates in this movie. He kind of growls and barks instead, offering terrific Newman presence but working against the little comedy there is, which mostly centers on how rough the business world is and how it victimizes the little guy. It's a Sturges story that way at least. Except when Newman's on the screen, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a kind of movie that can give you whiplash just from the subtitles. Most egregious in this regard is Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays an undercover reporter by cross-channeling Rosalind Russell-meets-Katharine Hepburn. It's fun to watch her for a minute or two even with her lines obviously dubbed in at points, but watching her flap her hands around and rant in what might as well be Esperanto for minutes at a time gets tired. "Hudsucker" itself seems to work with the idea the faster it moves, the more clever it is. Or maybe it's just trying to bull you though a sketchy plot. Once Barnes plays his and the movie's one ace, revealing this invention which he has been touting since the opening credits, he becomes a heel and a bore. Barnes should offer an engaging center, but doesn't because of both a lacking script Ethan and director Joel Coen wrote with horror-film legend Sam Raimi and because of Robbins' overly broad performance. By the time the movie gets to the end, you can feel the writers shrugging their collective shoulders. "You got a better idea?" a character asks us directly at one point, a funny moment but also an admission that they did not. Stylistically, "Hudsucker Proxy" is fun to look at, with its stereotypical 1950s production design run amuck. Engaging piecework from Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney as a pair of hard-case journalists and Peter Gallagher as a thinly-disguised Dean Martin mean good things turn up now and again. The Carter Burwell score plays off the melody of "Stormy Weather" before launching into some engaging thematic material of its own. "Hudsucker" is ultimately a film that exists to show off its influences, and be judged by comparison. That these guys love Preston Sturges is clear here; that they picked up on his screen economy, witty dialogue, and razor-sharp characterizations is better demonstrated by their other movies.

    Tim Robbins is a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries when the president of the company jumps out the window to his death. Norville(Robbins) is the chosen successor by way of the maneuvering of a board member, Stanley Mussberger(Paul Newman). Stanley is looking to depress the stock price for an easy takeover and Norville is his means of accomplishing this. Norville shocks everyone by inventing the hula hoop which becomes a huge seller with kids. Stanley continues to plot against his naive young man and the Coen boys turn to fantasy for the second half of this 1950's style screwball comedy in the tradition of Preston Sturges. It is a worthy entry which I would rank a notch below the masterpiece, "Fargo," my personal favorite.

    As most of the Coen brother's movies I've seen, I came out of this one confused and still unsure if I had liked it or hated it. It's a good movie, it's fun and makes you laugh in some ways that might be considered dumb. But after a few minutes you realise that it has a great history, and you end up surprised about how good it actually is. What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the environment created. An environment filled with stereotyped business man, with enlarged characterised faces and behaviour, which I simply found marvellous. Followed by the non-surprising surprising twists and turns, again, typical of every Coen Brother's film, this movie came out as a good but not great movie. I do recommend it for the story and environment created. So watch it, you'll be pleased, surprised and amused.

It's hilarious, yet thoughtful, morally uplifting, educational, proves a very valid point, and was released in 1994. I want to thank my friend for watching it with me immediately upon learning that I had not seen it before. Simply, wow and a whole lot of whohohohohohahahahahhaohohohoho!!!!!........

    I am not really sure what is it about this movie that makes it so addictive and lovable. I've seen it many times and sometimes I just listen to it and always enjoyed it. I believe this is a kind of movie which only can be made by ones who really love cinema, you know someone like Tornatore, and I think Cohen brothers are those kind of people. The movie seems so perfect to me that I can't find even one negative point. It really makes me wonder how come a movie which didn't grab much attention and was considered a box office bomb could be otherwise a master piece. This movie is certainly among the top 5 best movies I've ever seen!

    I usually like the Cohen brothers movies and I know how they like to make unusual screw ball type comedy but this one was just too over the top for me. I know if was supposed to be that was and it was supposed to be campy but just not my style. Its like a serious movie thats made for little kids it almost seems. It seems a like a movie on YTV or something. This movie is about a college graduate on the lowest end of a huge corporation. The copration hatches this plan to hire a new CEO and make sure hes very dumb so the company stock falls. They want to do this so they can afford all the stock to themselvs. This movie was not all bad but one of the worst Cohen brothers movies and that pains me to say because I am a huge fan of Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou and No country for Old men. If you like quirky comedies this one you will like or if you just love the humor of the Cohen brothers and if you do you know it.

    The Coen Brothers' reputation for stylistic excess was never as well earned as here. Obviously aiming for the feel of a Preston Sturges classic comedy, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a stridently acted, indifferently written display of cinematic excess. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) lands in New York City just off the bus from Muncie, Indiana, looking for a job. Just as he gives up hope, a job literally falls from the sky, that of chief executive of cash-loaded Hudsucker Industries. Its CEO/Founder Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) "merges with the infinite" by taking a header from the 44th floor, leaving his board with a lot of precious loose stock to claim. Board member Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) decides the best solution is to bring the stock price down, quick, and grab up what the market dumps. "Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue," Mussburger sneers. "What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder." After Barnes nearly sets fire to Mussburger's office, the old snake figures he's found just the guy. Newman's unique here in that he doesn't spit out his lines rapid-fire out of the side of his mouth like William Demarest with lockjaw or any of Newman's castmates in this movie. He kind of growls and barks instead, offering terrific Newman presence but working against the little comedy there is, which mostly centers on how rough the business world is and how it victimizes the little guy. It's a Sturges story that way at least. Except when Newman's on the screen, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a kind of movie that can give you whiplash just from the subtitles. Most egregious in this regard is Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays an undercover reporter by cross-channeling Rosalind Russell-meets-Katharine Hepburn. It's fun to watch her for a minute or two even with her lines obviously dubbed in at points, but watching her flap her hands around and rant in what might as well be Esperanto for minutes at a time gets tired. "Hudsucker" itself seems to work with the idea the faster it moves, the more clever it is. Or maybe it's just trying to bull you though a sketchy plot. Once Barnes plays his and the movie's one ace, revealing this invention which he has been touting since the opening credits, he becomes a heel and a bore. Barnes should offer an engaging center, but doesn't because of both a lacking script Ethan and director Joel Coen wrote with horror-film legend Sam Raimi and because of Robbins' overly broad performance. By the time the movie gets to the end, you can feel the writers shrugging their collective shoulders. "You got a better idea?" a character asks us directly at one point, a funny moment but also an admission that they did not. Stylistically, "Hudsucker Proxy" is fun to look at, with its stereotypical 1950s production design run amuck. Engaging piecework from Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney as a pair of hard-case journalists and Peter Gallagher as a thinly-disguised Dean Martin mean good things turn up now and again. The Carter Burwell score plays off the melody of "Stormy Weather" before launching into some engaging thematic material of its own. "Hudsucker" is ultimately a film that exists to show off its influences, and be judged by comparison. That these guys love Preston Sturges is clear here; that they picked up on his screen economy, witty dialogue, and razor-sharp characterizations is better demonstrated by their other movies.

    Tim Robbins is a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries when the president of the company jumps out the window to his death. Norville(Robbins) is the chosen successor by way of the maneuvering of a board member, Stanley Mussberger(Paul Newman). Stanley is looking to depress the stock price for an easy takeover and Norville is his means of accomplishing this. Norville shocks everyone by inventing the hula hoop which becomes a huge seller with kids. Stanley continues to plot against his naive young man and the Coen boys turn to fantasy for the second half of this 1950's style screwball comedy in the tradition of Preston Sturges. It is a worthy entry which I would rank a notch below the masterpiece, "Fargo," my personal favorite.

    As most of the Coen brother's movies I've seen, I came out of this one confused and still unsure if I had liked it or hated it. It's a good movie, it's fun and makes you laugh in some ways that might be considered dumb. But after a few minutes you realise that it has a great history, and you end up surprised about how good it actually is. What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the environment created. An environment filled with stereotyped business man, with enlarged characterised faces and behaviour, which I simply found marvellous. Followed by the non-surprising surprising twists and turns, again, typical of every Coen Brother's film, this movie came out as a good but not great movie. I do recommend it for the story and environment created. So watch it, you'll be pleased, surprised and amused.

    After watching "The Hudsucker Proxy" again, and reading Roger Ebert's review (again), I lamentably admit that I'm totally out of words. The film is so incongruously appealing that I feel my review should match the same level of creativeness and wonder it brought on the screen. But seriously, what more can I say about the Coen brothers' "The Hudsucker Proxy" that it's one of the best-looking comedies ever. There are many moments in the film, (in fact, quite every time) where I felt myself wondering if I had to keep track on the story or my eyes on the dazzling looks it offered: from the beautiful panoramic shots of majestic and creepy Babel-Tower like skyscrapers or the sumptuous recreation of the Big Corporations' inside rooms with never-ending tables as vertiginous as the buildings, from a horizontal perspective. Roger Deakins' geometric cinematography is absolutely breath-taking and rather than being put for the only 'eye-pleasing' purpose, works as the setting of some spectacular scenes. The most notable one is the opening where the respected President, Waring Hudsucker, played by the late Charles Durning, decides to make the big dive, fed up of all that business mumbo-jumbo he had to endure his all life. That long jump and long is an understatement (Hudsucker even finds time to tell people on the ground to move away), is weirdly convincing and hilarious through the anticlimactic slap at the end, the obligatory fat-ugly woman screaming and the verbal aftermath carried by heartless board members and their ruthless leader, Sidney Mussburger, played by Paul Newman. The jump scene sums up the film's appeal: it looks great and makes you laugh. And naturally, if you're a fan of Frank Capra's classics where greedy corporate businessman use a naive and idealistic schmuck to fulfill some evil schemes, and all the subsequent archetypes: spinning closes-up on newspapers headlines, nosy and noisy journalists and the snappy wisecracking workaholic female who'll get infatuated on the goodhearted fool she investigates on (Tim Robbins is perfect as the well-meaning Norville Barnes), comic-reliefs sidekicks and all that stuff, well, if you look at Hollywood Golden Age with nostalgic eyes, "The Hudsucker Proxy" will be familiar territory for you. And that Capraesque touch clearly helps to appreciate the film. Indeed, that half-homage and half-parody approach constitutes a solid platform on which the improbability of the story can efficiently evolve. And for some strange reasons, to which the Coen brothers only know the secret, each actor, by playing his character in the required over-the-top way, gave them that touch of believability for the film's bizarre poetry. I concede it takes time to get into some characters, I for once, thought Jennifer Lason Leigh was unbearable as the journalist, now, I can't see how her performance could have worked differently. The point is not that she impersonated Katharine Hepburn or Rosalind Russell well or badly, but that she was 'impersonating'. It's a film firmly aware of its 'cinematicality'. Naturally, the film isn't beyond criticism for all that. Many would argue that its very attention to great designs and magnificent looking details give a touch of seriousness inducing more serious expectations regarding the plot. My agreement with Ebert concerns the way the poster spoiled what would have been one hell of a middle-plot twist. I'm talking of course of the circle that would be revealed as the hula-hoop. That basic circle, Norville Barnes showed to everyone, adding the repeated line "You know, for kids" as if it was supposed to give a clue, could have been the film's McGuffin since it's the very device that triggers Mussburger's desire to hire Barnes as the proxy, in order to depress the stock and buys all the company's interests, but what a great surprise it would have been to have that revealed in the middle of the film. Apart from that missed opportunity, the film works and never leaves any hint of a dramatic evolution of the story. And when drama, there is, it only plays as set-ups from some screwball situations, the opening with Norville Barnes trying to jump from the Hudsucker's high clock is a reminiscence of John Doe's character (Gary Cooper) in "Meet John Doe", but I defy anyone to claim that he saw the resolution coming. Not to say that it would satisfy all the viewers, but still, it fits the film's surrealistic touch to the film, with all flash and style, but not without substance. Granted "The Hudsucker Proxy" isn't "Metropolis", "The Crowd" or "Brazil" but by its stylistic recreation of these iconic setting, leverage our thoughts to the more satirical material. Maybe it's too far-fetched, but I didn't think the film needed to speak explicit statement against savage capitalism; the point is smoothly made without distracting from the slapstick and screwball material. The assumption of 'all flash and no substance' isn't totally irrelevant but with such flashy brilliance and such great dialogs, the film can't be branded as unsubstantial. It's classy, surrealist, and funny and much more, it succeeds to put all these qualities together, something a few films can pretend to achieve. And on a more basic level, the film is so damn funny. I laughed, I laughed a lot. Maybe not as much as in the first act, but the laughs were equally combined with true satire and a dazzling photography, served by superb performances. The film works both on the surface and its content. I wish I could say more, I wish my vocabulary would be richer, but all I can do is summarize the film by paraphrasing its repeated line "you know, for laughs" That's what it is, a movie made for laughs, and the rest is just a delightful cinematic experience, something fresh made out of familiar material. Basically, the Coen brothers did the same than Norville Barnes: they reinvented the wheel.

    It is two weeks before the New Year of 1959. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) has arrived in New York City looking for a job after his graduation from college in Muncie, Indiana. With no working experience, he found himself working at the mailroom of the Hudsucker Industries. On the same day, the company's founder and president Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) unexpectedly committed suicide by jumping off from the top-floor window despite the company had been doing well financially. Back at the mailroom, there is the arrival of the 'Blue Letter' which Barnes had been assigned to hand it personally to Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), a member of the board of directors. When Barnes did eventually meet Mussburger, he would forget about the letter he was supposed to deliver and began talking about the new invention he had for the company. Mussburger would eventually decide to let Barnes become the replacement for Hudsucker, acting as the proxy where the company's stock would deflate at the appointment of an inexperienced and incompetent president. Across town, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist for the Manhattan Argus had successfully gone undercover working as a personal secretary for Barnes, pretending to be another desperate graduate from Muncie. In actual fact, she was assigned to do a profile of Barnes. Along the way, she would come to see how Barnes had been transformed as a person after his idea of the hula hoop take off across the country, going against what Mussburger and the board had thought the invention would depress the company stock. This can be seen as a film of about reversal of fortunes, of how Barnes went from the mailroom clerk to the company president and how he nearly went back to how it all started for him before being saved by an unlikely source. It is what would happen towards the ending which brings one full circle of what happened at the beginning of the film. Overall, it is a fairly enjoyable film, if one likes to root for the underdog which in this case is Barnes with the exception of what happened when the hula hoop invention changed his fortune.

    I have seen The Hud a half dozen times and it never gets old. From the opening sequence to the closing musical score this film keeps me enraptured. The art directing, the costumes, the music, the script all work together to make a movie of unprecedented beauty. Tim Robbins is perfect in this role and the supporting cast all come off the screen as unforgettable characters I proudly tell anyone who asks that this is my favorite film of all times. Sure, sure, art is subjective and some people do not care for such films. I feel sorry for them. This is a perfect film.

    I love the Coen brothers, and being a lesser Coen brother movie is hard, because all there others are so dang brilliant. The Hudsucker Proxy is a prime example of this. It's a good, funny movie, but watching it in the line-up the most the Coen brothers' other work, it's just a little weak. There are some great things about this flick though, for example the cinematography and visual look of the movie is totally awesome, and I really liked the film's premise/themes. The only thing I really didn't care for in this movie was Jennifer Jason Leigh... her character was annoying to me. The Hudsucker Proxy is definitely worth watching, and if you're a hardcore fan of the Coen brothers like myself, I think you'll enjoy and appreciate this underrated gem.

Not to say that it would satisfy all the viewers, but still, it fits the film's surrealistic touch to the film, with all flash and style, but not without substance. Granted "The Hudsucker Proxy" isn't "Metropolis", "The Crowd" or "Brazil" but by its stylistic recreation of these iconic setting, leverage our thoughts to the more satirical material. Maybe it's too far-fetched, but I didn't think the film needed to speak explicit statement against savage capitalism; the point is smoothly made without distracting from the slapstick and screwball material. The assumption of 'all flash and no substance' isn't totally irrelevant but with such flashy brilliance and such great dialogs, the film can't be branded as unsubstantial. It's classy, surrealist, and funny and much more, it succeeds to put all these qualities together, something a few films can pretend to achieve. And on a more basic level, the film is so damn funny. I laughed, I laughed a lot. Maybe not as much as in the first act, but the laughs were equally combined with true satire and a dazzling photography, served by superb performances. The film works both on the surface and its content. I wish I could say more, I wish my vocabulary would be richer, but all I can do is summarize the film by paraphrasing its repeated line "you know, for laughs" That's what it is, a movie made for laughs, and the rest is just a delightful cinematic experience, something fresh made out of familiar material. Basically, the Coen brothers did the same than Norville Barnes: they reinvented the wheel.

    It is two weeks before the New Year of 1959. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) has arrived in New York City looking for a job after his graduation from college in Muncie, Indiana. With no working experience, he found himself working at the mailroom of the Hudsucker Industries. On the same day, the company's founder and president Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) unexpectedly committed suicide by jumping off from the top-floor window despite the company had been doing well financially. Back at the mailroom, there is the arrival of the 'Blue Letter' which Barnes had been assigned to hand it personally to Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), a member of the board of directors. When Barnes did eventually meet Mussburger, he would forget about the letter he was supposed to deliver and began talking about the new invention he had for the company. Mussburger would eventually decide to let Barnes become the replacement for Hudsucker, acting as the proxy where the company's stock would deflate at the appointment of an inexperienced and incompetent president. Across town, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist for the Manhattan Argus had successfully gone undercover working as a personal secretary for Barnes, pretending to be another desperate graduate from Muncie. In actual fact, she was assigned to do a profile of Barnes. Along the way, she would come to see how Barnes had been transformed as a person after his idea of the hula hoop take off across the country, going against what Mussburger and the board had thought the invention would depress the company stock. This can be seen as a film of about reversal of fortunes, of how Barnes went from the mailroom clerk to the company president and how he nearly went back to how it all started for him before being saved by an unlikely source. It is what would happen towards the ending which brings one full circle of what happened at the beginning of the film. Overall, it is a fairly enjoyable film, if one likes to root for the underdog which in this case is Barnes with the exception of what happened when the hula hoop invention changed his fortune.

    I have seen The Hud a half dozen times and it never gets old. From the opening sequence to the closing musical score this film keeps me enraptured. The art directing, the costumes, the music, the script all work together to make a movie of unprecedented beauty. Tim Robbins is perfect in this role and the supporting cast all come off the screen as unforgettable characters I proudly tell anyone who asks that this is my favorite film of all times. Sure, sure, art is subjective and some people do not care for such films. I feel sorry for them. This is a perfect film.

    I love the Coen brothers, and being a lesser Coen brother movie is hard, because all there others are so dang brilliant. The Hudsucker Proxy is a prime example of this. It's a good, funny movie, but watching it in the line-up the most the Coen brothers' other work, it's just a little weak. There are some great things about this flick though, for example the cinematography and visual look of the movie is totally awesome, and I really liked the film's premise/themes. The only thing I really didn't care for in this movie was Jennifer Jason Leigh... her character was annoying to me. The Hudsucker Proxy is definitely worth watching, and if you're a hardcore fan of the Coen brothers like myself, I think you'll enjoy and appreciate this underrated gem.

    It fills me with really great satisfaction to see such an excellently made and acted movie. Every word, scene, prop, and symbol are perfectly blended into one great awesome package. It's incredibly funny, a as matter of fact it has one of the longest funny scenes I have ever seen in my life, and not a word is spoken in it. Kudos to everyone in this film, directing is amazing, the visualization magnificent. It's hilarious, yet thoughtful, morally uplifting, educational, proves a very valid point, and was released in 1994. I want to thank my friend for watching it with me immediately upon learning that I had not seen it before. Simply, wow and a whole lot of whohohohohohahahahahhaohohohoho!!!!!........

    I am not really sure what is it about this movie that makes it so addictive and lovable. I've seen it many times and sometimes I just listen to it and always enjoyed it. I believe this is a kind of movie which only can be made by ones who really love cinema, you know someone like Tornatore, and I think Cohen brothers are those kind of people. The movie seems so perfect to me that I can't find even one negative point. It really makes me wonder how come a movie which didn't grab much attention and was considered a box office bomb could be otherwise a master piece. This movie is certainly among the top 5 best movies I've ever seen!

    I usually like the Cohen brothers movies and I know how they like to make unusual screw ball type comedy but this one was just too over the top for me. I know if was supposed to be that was and it was supposed to be campy but just not my style. Its like a serious movie thats made for little kids it almost seems. It seems a like a movie on YTV or something. This movie is about a college graduate on the lowest end of a huge corporation. The copration hatches this plan to hire a new CEO and make sure hes very dumb so the company stock falls. They want to do this so they can afford all the stock to themselvs. This movie was not all bad but one of the worst Cohen brothers movies and that pains me to say because I am a huge fan of Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou and No country for Old men. If you like quirky comedies this one you will like or if you just love the humor of the Cohen brothers and if you do you know it.

    The Coen Brothers' reputation for stylistic excess was never as well earned as here. Obviously aiming for the feel of a Preston Sturges classic comedy, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a stridently acted, indifferently written display of cinematic excess. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) lands in New York City just off the bus from Muncie, Indiana, looking for a job. Just as he gives up hope, a job literally falls from the sky, that of chief executive of cash-loaded Hudsucker Industries. Its CEO/Founder Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) "merges with the infinite" by taking a header from the 44th floor, leaving his board with a lot of precious loose stock to claim. Board member Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) decides the best solution is to bring the stock price down, quick, and grab up what the market dumps. "Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue," Mussburger sneers. "What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder." After Barnes nearly sets fire to Mussburger's office, the old snake figures he's found just the guy. Newman's unique here in that he doesn't spit out his lines rapid-fire out of the side of his mouth like William Demarest with lockjaw or any of Newman's castmates in this movie. He kind of growls and barks instead, offering terrific Newman presence but working against the little comedy there is, which mostly centers on how rough the business world is and how it victimizes the little guy. It's a Sturges story that way at least. Except when Newman's on the screen, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a kind of movie that can give you whiplash just from the subtitles. Most egregious in this regard is Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays an undercover reporter by cross-channeling Rosalind Russell-meets-Katharine Hepburn. It's fun to watch her for a minute or two even with her lines obviously dubbed in at points, but watching her flap her hands around and rant in what might as well be Esperanto for minutes at a time gets tired. "Hudsucker" itself seems to work with the idea the faster it moves, the more clever it is. Or maybe it's just trying to bull you though a sketchy plot. Once Barnes plays his and the movie's one ace, revealing this invention which he has been touting since the opening credits, he becomes a heel and a bore. Barnes should offer an engaging center, but doesn't because of both a lacking script Ethan and director Joel Coen wrote with horror-film legend Sam Raimi and because of Robbins' overly broad performance. By the time the movie gets to the end, you can feel the writers shrugging their collective shoulders. "You got a better idea?" a character asks us directly at one point, a funny moment but also an admission that they did not. Stylistically, "Hudsucker Proxy" is fun to look at, with its stereotypical 1950s production design run amuck. Engaging piecework from Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney as a pair of hard-case journalists and Peter Gallagher as a thinly-disguised Dean Martin mean good things turn up now and again. The Carter Burwell score plays off the melody of "Stormy Weather" before launching into some engaging thematic material of its own. "Hudsucker" is ultimately a film that exists to show off its influences, and be judged by comparison. That these guys love Preston Sturges is clear here; that they picked up on his screen economy, witty dialogue, and razor-sharp characterizations is better demonstrated by their other movies.

    Tim Robbins is a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries when the president of the company jumps out the window to his death. Norville(Robbins) is the chosen successor by way of the maneuvering of a board member, Stanley Mussberger(Paul Newman). Stanley is looking to depress the stock price for an easy takeover and Norville is his means of accomplishing this. Norville shocks everyone by inventing the hula hoop which becomes a huge seller with kids. Stanley continues to plot against his naive young man and the Coen boys turn to fantasy for the second half of this 1950's style screwball comedy in the tradition of Preston Sturges. It is a worthy entry which I would rank a notch below the masterpiece, "Fargo," my personal favorite.

    As most of the Coen brother's movies I've seen, I came out of this one confused and still unsure if I had liked it or hated it. It's a good movie, it's fun and makes you laugh in some ways that might be considered dumb. But after a few minutes you realise that it has a great history, and you end up surprised about how good it actually is. What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the environment created. An environment filled with stereotyped business man, with enlarged characterised faces and behaviour, which I simply found marvellous. Followed by the non-surprising surprising twists and turns, again, typical of every Coen Brother's film, this movie came out as a good but not great movie. I do recommend it for the story and environment created. So watch it, you'll be pleased, surprised and amused.

    After watching "The Hudsucker Proxy" again, and reading Roger Ebert's review (again), I lamentably admit that I'm totally out of words. The film is so incongruously appealing that I feel my review should match the same level of creativeness and wonder it brought on the screen. But seriously, what more can I say about the Coen brothers' "The Hudsucker Proxy" that it's one of the best-looking comedies ever. There are many moments in the film, (in fact, quite every time) where I felt myself wondering if I had to keep track on the story or my eyes on the dazzling looks it offered: from the beautiful panoramic shots of majestic and creepy Babel-Tower like skyscrapers or the sumptuous recreation of the Big Corporations' inside rooms with never-ending tables as vertiginous as the buildings, from a horizontal perspective. Roger Deakins' geometric cinematography is absolutely breath-taking and rather than being put for the only 'eye-pleasing' purpose, works as the setting of some spectacular scenes. The most notable one is the opening where the respected President, Waring Hudsucker, played by the late Charles Durning, decides to make the big dive, fed up of all that business mumbo-jumbo he had to endure his all life. That long jump and long is an understatement (Hudsucker even finds time to tell people on the ground to move away), is weirdly convincing and hilarious through the anticlimactic slap at the end, the obligatory fat-ugly woman screaming and the verbal aftermath carried by heartless board members and their ruthless leader, Sidney Mussburger, played by Paul Newman. The jump scene sums up the film's appeal: it looks great and makes you laugh. And naturally, if you're a fan of Frank Capra's classics where greedy corporate businessman use a naive and idealistic schmuck to fulfill some evil schemes, and all the subsequent archetypes: spinning closes-up on newspapers headlines, nosy and noisy journalists and the snappy wisecracking workaholic female who'll get infatuated on the goodhearted fool she investigates on (Tim Robbins is perfect as the well-meaning Norville Barnes), comic-reliefs sidekicks and all that stuff, well, if you look at Hollywood Golden Age with nostalgic eyes, "The Hudsucker Proxy" will be familiar territory for you. And that Capraesque touch clearly helps to appreciate the film. Indeed, that half-homage and half-parody approach constitutes a solid platform on which the improbability of the story can efficiently evolve. And for some strange reasons, to which the Coen brothers only know the secret, each actor, by playing his character in the required over-the-top way, gave them that touch of believability for the film's bizarre poetry. I concede it takes time to get into some characters, I for once, thought Jennifer Lason Leigh was unbearable as the journalist, now, I can't see how her performance could have worked differently. The point is not that she impersonated Katharine Hepburn or Rosalind Russell well or badly, but that she was 'impersonating'. It's a film firmly aware of its 'cinematicality'. Naturally, the film isn't beyond criticism for all that. Many would argue that its very attention to great designs and magnificent looking details give a touch of seriousness inducing more serious expectations regarding the plot. My agreement with Ebert concerns the way the poster spoiled what would have been one hell of a middle-plot twist. I'm talking of course of the circle that would be revealed as the hula-hoop. That basic circle, Norville Barnes showed to everyone, adding the repeated line "You know, for kids" as if it was supposed to give a clue, could have been the film's McGuffin since it's the very device that triggers Mussburger's desire to hire Barnes as the proxy, in order to depress the stock and buys all the company's interests, but what a great surprise it would have been to have that revealed in the middle of the film. Apart from that missed opportunity, the film works and never leaves any hint of a dramatic evolution of the story. And when drama, there is, it only plays as set-ups from some screwball situations, the opening with Norville Barnes trying to jump from the Hudsucker's high clock is a reminiscence of John Doe's character (Gary Cooper) in "Meet John Doe", but I defy anyone to claim that he saw the resolution coming.

That these guys love Preston Sturges is clear here; that they picked up on his screen economy, witty dialogue, and razor-sharp characterizations is better demonstrated by their other movies.

    Tim Robbins is a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries when the president of the company jumps out the window to his death. Norville(Robbins) is the chosen successor by way of the maneuvering of a board member, Stanley Mussberger(Paul Newman). Stanley is looking to depress the stock price for an easy takeover and Norville is his means of accomplishing this. Norville shocks everyone by inventing the hula hoop which becomes a huge seller with kids. Stanley continues to plot against his naive young man and the Coen boys turn to fantasy for the second half of this 1950's style screwball comedy in the tradition of Preston Sturges. It is a worthy entry which I would rank a notch below the masterpiece, "Fargo," my personal favorite.

    As most of the Coen brother's movies I've seen, I came out of this one confused and still unsure if I had liked it or hated it. It's a good movie, it's fun and makes you laugh in some ways that might be considered dumb. But after a few minutes you realise that it has a great history, and you end up surprised about how good it actually is. What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the environment created. An environment filled with stereotyped business man, with enlarged characterised faces and behaviour, which I simply found marvellous. Followed by the non-surprising surprising twists and turns, again, typical of every Coen Brother's film, this movie came out as a good but not great movie. I do recommend it for the story and environment created. So watch it, you'll be pleased, surprised and amused.

    After watching "The Hudsucker Proxy" again, and reading Roger Ebert's review (again), I lamentably admit that I'm totally out of words. The film is so incongruously appealing that I feel my review should match the same level of creativeness and wonder it brought on the screen. But seriously, what more can I say about the Coen brothers' "The Hudsucker Proxy" that it's one of the best-looking comedies ever. There are many moments in the film, (in fact, quite every time) where I felt myself wondering if I had to keep track on the story or my eyes on the dazzling looks it offered: from the beautiful panoramic shots of majestic and creepy Babel-Tower like skyscrapers or the sumptuous recreation of the Big Corporations' inside rooms with never-ending tables as vertiginous as the buildings, from a horizontal perspective. Roger Deakins' geometric cinematography is absolutely breath-taking and rather than being put for the only 'eye-pleasing' purpose, works as the setting of some spectacular scenes. The most notable one is the opening where the respected President, Waring Hudsucker, played by the late Charles Durning, decides to make the big dive, fed up of all that business mumbo-jumbo he had to endure his all life. That long jump and long is an understatement (Hudsucker even finds time to tell people on the ground to move away), is weirdly convincing and hilarious through the anticlimactic slap at the end, the obligatory fat-ugly woman screaming and the verbal aftermath carried by heartless board members and their ruthless leader, Sidney Mussburger, played by Paul Newman. The jump scene sums up the film's appeal: it looks great and makes you laugh. And naturally, if you're a fan of Frank Capra's classics where greedy corporate businessman use a naive and idealistic schmuck to fulfill some evil schemes, and all the subsequent archetypes: spinning closes-up on newspapers headlines, nosy and noisy journalists and the snappy wisecracking workaholic female who'll get infatuated on the goodhearted fool she investigates on (Tim Robbins is perfect as the well-meaning Norville Barnes), comic-reliefs sidekicks and all that stuff, well, if you look at Hollywood Golden Age with nostalgic eyes, "The Hudsucker Proxy" will be familiar territory for you. And that Capraesque touch clearly helps to appreciate the film. Indeed, that half-homage and half-parody approach constitutes a solid platform on which the improbability of the story can efficiently evolve. And for some strange reasons, to which the Coen brothers only know the secret, each actor, by playing his character in the required over-the-top way, gave them that touch of believability for the film's bizarre poetry. I concede it takes time to get into some characters, I for once, thought Jennifer Lason Leigh was unbearable as the journalist, now, I can't see how her performance could have worked differently. The point is not that she impersonated Katharine Hepburn or Rosalind Russell well or badly, but that she was 'impersonating'. It's a film firmly aware of its 'cinematicality'. Naturally, the film isn't beyond criticism for all that. Many would argue that its very attention to great designs and magnificent looking details give a touch of seriousness inducing more serious expectations regarding the plot. My agreement with Ebert concerns the way the poster spoiled what would have been one hell of a middle-plot twist. I'm talking of course of the circle that would be revealed as the hula-hoop. That basic circle, Norville Barnes showed to everyone, adding the repeated line "You know, for kids" as if it was supposed to give a clue, could have been the film's McGuffin since it's the very device that triggers Mussburger's desire to hire Barnes as the proxy, in order to depress the stock and buys all the company's interests, but what a great surprise it would have been to have that revealed in the middle of the film. Apart from that missed opportunity, the film works and never leaves any hint of a dramatic evolution of the story. And when drama, there is, it only plays as set-ups from some screwball situations, the opening with Norville Barnes trying to jump from the Hudsucker's high clock is a reminiscence of John Doe's character (Gary Cooper) in "Meet John Doe", but I defy anyone to claim that he saw the resolution coming. Not to say that it would satisfy all the viewers, but still, it fits the film's surrealistic touch to the film, with all flash and style, but not without substance. Granted "The Hudsucker Proxy" isn't "Metropolis", "The Crowd" or "Brazil" but by its stylistic recreation of these iconic setting, leverage our thoughts to the more satirical material. Maybe it's too far-fetched, but I didn't think the film needed to speak explicit statement against savage capitalism; the point is smoothly made without distracting from the slapstick and screwball material. The assumption of 'all flash and no substance' isn't totally irrelevant but with such flashy brilliance and such great dialogs, the film can't be branded as unsubstantial. It's classy, surrealist, and funny and much more, it succeeds to put all these qualities together, something a few films can pretend to achieve. And on a more basic level, the film is so damn funny. I laughed, I laughed a lot. Maybe not as much as in the first act, but the laughs were equally combined with true satire and a dazzling photography, served by superb performances. The film works both on the surface and its content. I wish I could say more, I wish my vocabulary would be richer, but all I can do is summarize the film by paraphrasing its repeated line "you know, for laughs" That's what it is, a movie made for laughs, and the rest is just a delightful cinematic experience, something fresh made out of familiar material. Basically, the Coen brothers did the same than Norville Barnes: they reinvented the wheel.

    It is two weeks before the New Year of 1959. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) has arrived in New York City looking for a job after his graduation from college in Muncie, Indiana. With no working experience, he found himself working at the mailroom of the Hudsucker Industries. On the same day, the company's founder and president Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) unexpectedly committed suicide by jumping off from the top-floor window despite the company had been doing well financially. Back at the mailroom, there is the arrival of the 'Blue Letter' which Barnes had been assigned to hand it personally to Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), a member of the board of directors. When Barnes did eventually meet Mussburger, he would forget about the letter he was supposed to deliver and began talking about the new invention he had for the company. Mussburger would eventually decide to let Barnes become the replacement for Hudsucker, acting as the proxy where the company's stock would deflate at the appointment of an inexperienced and incompetent president. Across town, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist for the Manhattan Argus had successfully gone undercover working as a personal secretary for Barnes, pretending to be another desperate graduate from Muncie. In actual fact, she was assigned to do a profile of Barnes. Along the way, she would come to see how Barnes had been transformed as a person after his idea of the hula hoop take off across the country, going against what Mussburger and the board had thought the invention would depress the company stock. This can be seen as a film of about reversal of fortunes, of how Barnes went from the mailroom clerk to the company president and how he nearly went back to how it all started for him before being saved by an unlikely source. It is what would happen towards the ending which brings one full circle of what happened at the beginning of the film. Overall, it is a fairly enjoyable film, if one likes to root for the underdog which in this case is Barnes with the exception of what happened when the hula hoop invention changed his fortune.

    I have seen The Hud a half dozen times and it never gets old. From the opening sequence to the closing musical score this film keeps me enraptured. The art directing, the costumes, the music, the script all work together to make a movie of unprecedented beauty. Tim Robbins is perfect in this role and the supporting cast all come off the screen as unforgettable characters I proudly tell anyone who asks that this is my favorite film of all times. Sure, sure, art is subjective and some people do not care for such films. I feel sorry for them. This is a perfect film.

    I love the Coen brothers, and being a lesser Coen brother movie is hard, because all there others are so dang brilliant. The Hudsucker Proxy is a prime example of this. It's a good, funny movie, but watching it in the line-up the most the Coen brothers' other work, it's just a little weak. There are some great things about this flick though, for example the cinematography and visual look of the movie is totally awesome, and I really liked the film's premise/themes. The only thing I really didn't care for in this movie was Jennifer Jason Leigh... her character was annoying to me. The Hudsucker Proxy is definitely worth watching, and if you're a hardcore fan of the Coen brothers like myself, I think you'll enjoy and appreciate this underrated gem.

    It fills me with really great satisfaction to see such an excellently made and acted movie. Every word, scene, prop, and symbol are perfectly blended into one great awesome package. It's incredibly funny, a as matter of fact it has one of the longest funny scenes I have ever seen in my life, and not a word is spoken in it. Kudos to everyone in this film, directing is amazing, the visualization magnificent. It's hilarious, yet thoughtful, morally uplifting, educational, proves a very valid point, and was released in 1994. I want to thank my friend for watching it with me immediately upon learning that I had not seen it before. Simply, wow and a whole lot of whohohohohohahahahahhaohohohoho!!!!!........

    I am not really sure what is it about this movie that makes it so addictive and lovable. I've seen it many times and sometimes I just listen to it and always enjoyed it. I believe this is a kind of movie which only can be made by ones who really love cinema, you know someone like Tornatore, and I think Cohen brothers are those kind of people. The movie seems so perfect to me that I can't find even one negative point. It really makes me wonder how come a movie which didn't grab much attention and was considered a box office bomb could be otherwise a master piece. This movie is certainly among the top 5 best movies I've ever seen!

    I usually like the Cohen brothers movies and I know how they like to make unusual screw ball type comedy but this one was just too over the top for me. I know if was supposed to be that was and it was supposed to be campy but just not my style. Its like a serious movie thats made for little kids it almost seems. It seems a like a movie on YTV or something. This movie is about a college graduate on the lowest end of a huge corporation. The copration hatches this plan to hire a new CEO and make sure hes very dumb so the company stock falls. They want to do this so they can afford all the stock to themselvs. This movie was not all bad but one of the worst Cohen brothers movies and that pains me to say because I am a huge fan of Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou and No country for Old men. If you like quirky comedies this one you will like or if you just love the humor of the Cohen brothers and if you do you know it.

    The Coen Brothers' reputation for stylistic excess was never as well earned as here. Obviously aiming for the feel of a Preston Sturges classic comedy, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a stridently acted, indifferently written display of cinematic excess. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) lands in New York City just off the bus from Muncie, Indiana, looking for a job. Just as he gives up hope, a job literally falls from the sky, that of chief executive of cash-loaded Hudsucker Industries. Its CEO/Founder Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) "merges with the infinite" by taking a header from the 44th floor, leaving his board with a lot of precious loose stock to claim. Board member Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) decides the best solution is to bring the stock price down, quick, and grab up what the market dumps. "Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue," Mussburger sneers. "What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder." After Barnes nearly sets fire to Mussburger's office, the old snake figures he's found just the guy. Newman's unique here in that he doesn't spit out his lines rapid-fire out of the side of his mouth like William Demarest with lockjaw or any of Newman's castmates in this movie. He kind of growls and barks instead, offering terrific Newman presence but working against the little comedy there is, which mostly centers on how rough the business world is and how it victimizes the little guy. It's a Sturges story that way at least. Except when Newman's on the screen, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a kind of movie that can give you whiplash just from the subtitles. Most egregious in this regard is Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays an undercover reporter by cross-channeling Rosalind Russell-meets-Katharine Hepburn. It's fun to watch her for a minute or two even with her lines obviously dubbed in at points, but watching her flap her hands around and rant in what might as well be Esperanto for minutes at a time gets tired. "Hudsucker" itself seems to work with the idea the faster it moves, the more clever it is. Or maybe it's just trying to bull you though a sketchy plot. Once Barnes plays his and the movie's one ace, revealing this invention which he has been touting since the opening credits, he becomes a heel and a bore. Barnes should offer an engaging center, but doesn't because of both a lacking script Ethan and director Joel Coen wrote with horror-film legend Sam Raimi and because of Robbins' overly broad performance. By the time the movie gets to the end, you can feel the writers shrugging their collective shoulders. "You got a better idea?" a character asks us directly at one point, a funny moment but also an admission that they did not. Stylistically, "Hudsucker Proxy" is fun to look at, with its stereotypical 1950s production design run amuck. Engaging piecework from Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney as a pair of hard-case journalists and Peter Gallagher as a thinly-disguised Dean Martin mean good things turn up now and again. The Carter Burwell score plays off the melody of "Stormy Weather" before launching into some engaging thematic material of its own. "Hudsucker" is ultimately a film that exists to show off its influences, and be judged by comparison. That these guys love Preston Sturges is clear here; that they picked up on his screen economy, witty dialogue, and razor-sharp characterizations is better demonstrated by their other movies.

    It fills me with really great satisfaction to see such an excellently made and acted movie. Every word, scene, prop, and symbol are perfectly blended into one great awesome package. It's incredibly funny, a as matter of fact it has one of the longest funny scenes I have ever seen in my life, and not a word is spoken in it. Kudos to everyone in this film, directing is amazing, the visualization magnificent. It's hilarious, yet thoughtful, morally uplifting, educational, proves a very valid point, and was released in 1994. I want to thank my friend for watching it with me immediately upon learning that I had not seen it before. Simply, wow and a whole lot of whohohohohohahahahahhaohohohoho!!!!!........

    I am not really sure what is it about this movie that makes it so addictive and lovable. I've seen it many times and sometimes I just listen to it and always enjoyed it. I believe this is a kind of movie which only can be made by ones who really love cinema, you know someone like Tornatore, and I think Cohen brothers are those kind of people. The movie seems so perfect to me that I can't find even one negative point. It really makes me wonder how come a movie which didn't grab much attention and was considered a box office bomb could be otherwise a master piece. This movie is certainly among the top 5 best movies I've ever seen!

    I usually like the Cohen brothers movies and I know how they like to make unusual screw ball type comedy but this one was just too over the top for me. I know if was supposed to be that was and it was supposed to be campy but just not my style. Its like a serious movie thats made for little kids it almost seems. It seems a like a movie on YTV or something. This movie is about a college graduate on the lowest end of a huge corporation. The copration hatches this plan to hire a new CEO and make sure hes very dumb so the company stock falls. They want to do this so they can afford all the stock to themselvs. This movie was not all bad but one of the worst Cohen brothers movies and that pains me to say because I am a huge fan of Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou and No country for Old men. If you like quirky comedies this one you will like or if you just love the humor of the Cohen brothers and if you do you know it.

    The Coen Brothers' reputation for stylistic excess was never as well earned as here. Obviously aiming for the feel of a Preston Sturges classic comedy, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a stridently acted, indifferently written display of cinematic excess. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) lands in New York City just off the bus from Muncie, Indiana, looking for a job. Just as he gives up hope, a job literally falls from the sky, that of chief executive of cash-loaded Hudsucker Industries. Its CEO/Founder Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) "merges with the infinite" by taking a header from the 44th floor, leaving his board with a lot of precious loose stock to claim. Board member Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) decides the best solution is to bring the stock price down, quick, and grab up what the market dumps. "Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue," Mussburger sneers. "What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder." After Barnes nearly sets fire to Mussburger's office, the old snake figures he's found just the guy. Newman's unique here in that he doesn't spit out his lines rapid-fire out of the side of his mouth like William Demarest with lockjaw or any of Newman's castmates in this movie. He kind of growls and barks instead, offering terrific Newman presence but working against the little comedy there is, which mostly centers on how rough the business world is and how it victimizes the little guy. It's a Sturges story that way at least. Except when Newman's on the screen, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a kind of movie that can give you whiplash just from the subtitles. Most egregious in this regard is Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays an undercover reporter by cross-channeling Rosalind Russell-meets-Katharine Hepburn. It's fun to watch her for a minute or two even with her lines obviously dubbed in at points, but watching her flap her hands around and rant in what might as well be Esperanto for minutes at a time gets tired. "Hudsucker" itself seems to work with the idea the faster it moves, the more clever it is. Or maybe it's just trying to bull you though a sketchy plot. Once Barnes plays his and the movie's one ace, revealing this invention which he has been touting since the opening credits, he becomes a heel and a bore. Barnes should offer an engaging center, but doesn't because of both a lacking script Ethan and director Joel Coen wrote with horror-film legend Sam Raimi and because of Robbins' overly broad performance. By the time the movie gets to the end, you can feel the writers shrugging their collective shoulders. "You got a better idea?" a character asks us directly at one point, a funny moment but also an admission that they did not. Stylistically, "Hudsucker Proxy" is fun to look at, with its stereotypical 1950s production design run amuck. Engaging piecework from Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney as a pair of hard-case journalists and Peter Gallagher as a thinly-disguised Dean Martin mean good things turn up now and again. The Carter Burwell score plays off the melody of "Stormy Weather" before launching into some engaging thematic material of its own. "Hudsucker" is ultimately a film that exists to show off its influences, and be judged by comparison. That these guys love Preston Sturges is clear here; that they picked up on his screen economy, witty dialogue, and razor-sharp characterizations is better demonstrated by their other movies.

    Tim Robbins is a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries when the president of the company jumps out the window to his death. Norville(Robbins) is the chosen successor by way of the maneuvering of a board member, Stanley Mussberger(Paul Newman). Stanley is looking to depress the stock price for an easy takeover and Norville is his means of accomplishing this. Norville shocks everyone by inventing the hula hoop which becomes a huge seller with kids. Stanley continues to plot against his naive young man and the Coen boys turn to fantasy for the second half of this 1950's style screwball comedy in the tradition of Preston Sturges. It is a worthy entry which I would rank a notch below the masterpiece, "Fargo," my personal favorite.

    As most of the Coen brother's movies I've seen, I came out of this one confused and still unsure if I had liked it or hated it. It's a good movie, it's fun and makes you laugh in some ways that might be considered dumb. But after a few minutes you realise that it has a great history, and you end up surprised about how good it actually is. What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the environment created. An environment filled with stereotyped business man, with enlarged characterised faces and behaviour, which I simply found marvellous. Followed by the non-surprising surprising twists and turns, again, typical of every Coen Brother's film, this movie came out as a good but not great movie. I do recommend it for the story and environment created. So watch it, you'll be pleased, surprised and amused.

    After watching "The Hudsucker Proxy" again, and reading Roger Ebert's review (again), I lamentably admit that I'm totally out of words. The film is so incongruously appealing that I feel my review should match the same level of creativeness and wonder it brought on the screen. But seriously, what more can I say about the Coen brothers' "The Hudsucker Proxy" that it's one of the best-looking comedies ever. There are many moments in the film, (in fact, quite every time) where I felt myself wondering if I had to keep track on the story or my eyes on the dazzling looks it offered: from the beautiful panoramic shots of majestic and creepy Babel-Tower like skyscrapers or the sumptuous recreation of the Big Corporations' inside rooms with never-ending tables as vertiginous as the buildings, from a horizontal perspective. Roger Deakins' geometric cinematography is absolutely breath-taking and rather than being put for the only 'eye-pleasing' purpose, works as the setting of some spectacular scenes. The most notable one is the opening where the respected President, Waring Hudsucker, played by the late Charles Durning, decides to make the big dive, fed up of all that business mumbo-jumbo he had to endure his all life. That long jump and long is an understatement (Hudsucker even finds time to tell people on the ground to move away), is weirdly convincing and hilarious through the anticlimactic slap at the end, the obligatory fat-ugly woman screaming and the verbal aftermath carried by heartless board members and their ruthless leader, Sidney Mussburger, played by Paul Newman. The jump scene sums up the film's appeal: it looks great and makes you laugh. And naturally, if you're a fan of Frank Capra's classics where greedy corporate businessman use a naive and idealistic schmuck to fulfill some evil schemes, and all the subsequent archetypes: spinning closes-up on newspapers headlines, nosy and noisy journalists and the snappy wisecracking workaholic female who'll get infatuated on the goodhearted fool she investigates on (Tim Robbins is perfect as the well-meaning Norville Barnes), comic-reliefs sidekicks and all that stuff, well, if you look at Hollywood Golden Age with nostalgic eyes, "The Hudsucker Proxy" will be familiar territory for you. And that Capraesque touch clearly helps to appreciate the film. Indeed, that half-homage and half-parody approach constitutes a solid platform on which the improbability of the story can efficiently evolve. And for some strange reasons, to which the Coen brothers only know the secret, each actor, by playing his character in the required over-the-top way, gave them that touch of believability for the film's bizarre poetry. I concede it takes time to get into some characters, I for once, thought Jennifer Lason Leigh was unbearable as the journalist, now, I can't see how her performance could have worked differently. The point is not that she impersonated Katharine Hepburn or Rosalind Russell well or badly, but that she was 'impersonating'. It's a film firmly aware of its 'cinematicality'. Naturally, the film isn't beyond criticism for all that. Many would argue that its very attention to great designs and magnificent looking details give a touch of seriousness inducing more serious expectations regarding the plot. My agreement with Ebert concerns the way the poster spoiled what would have been one hell of a middle-plot twist. I'm talking of course of the circle that would be revealed as the hula-hoop. That basic circle, Norville Barnes showed to everyone, adding the repeated line "You know, for kids" as if it was supposed to give a clue, could have been the film's McGuffin since it's the very device that triggers Mussburger's desire to hire Barnes as the proxy, in order to depress the stock and buys all the company's interests, but what a great surprise it would have been to have that revealed in the middle of the film. Apart from that missed opportunity, the film works and never leaves any hint of a dramatic evolution of the story. And when drama, there is, it only plays as set-ups from some screwball situations, the opening with Norville Barnes trying to jump from the Hudsucker's high clock is a reminiscence of John Doe's character (Gary Cooper) in "Meet John Doe", but I defy anyone to claim that he saw the resolution coming. Not to say that it would satisfy all the viewers, but still, it fits the film's surrealistic touch to the film, with all flash and style, but not without substance. Granted "The Hudsucker Proxy" isn't "Metropolis", "The Crowd" or "Brazil" but by its stylistic recreation of these iconic setting, leverage our thoughts to the more satirical material. Maybe it's too far-fetched, but I didn't think the film needed to speak explicit statement against savage capitalism; the point is smoothly made without distracting from the slapstick and screwball material. The assumption of 'all flash and no substance' isn't totally irrelevant but with such flashy brilliance and such great dialogs, the film can't be branded as unsubstantial. It's classy, surrealist, and funny and much more, it succeeds to put all these qualities together, something a few films can pretend to achieve. And on a more basic level, the film is so damn funny. I laughed, I laughed a lot. Maybe not as much as in the first act, but the laughs were equally combined with true satire and a dazzling photography, served by superb performances. The film works both on the surface and its content. I wish I could say more, I wish my vocabulary would be richer, but all I can do is summarize the film by paraphrasing its repeated line "you know, for laughs" That's what it is, a movie made for laughs, and the rest is just a delightful cinematic experience, something fresh made out of familiar material. Basically, the Coen brothers did the same than Norville Barnes: they reinvented the wheel.

    It is two weeks before the New Year of 1959. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) has arrived in New York City looking for a job after his graduation from college in Muncie, Indiana. With no working experience, he found himself working at the mailroom of the Hudsucker Industries. On the same day, the company's founder and president Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) unexpectedly committed suicide by jumping off from the top-floor window despite the company had been doing well financially. Back at the mailroom, there is the arrival of the 'Blue Letter' which Barnes had been assigned to hand it personally to Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), a member of the board of directors. When Barnes did eventually meet Mussburger, he would forget about the letter he was supposed to deliver and began talking about the new invention he had for the company. Mussburger would eventually decide to let Barnes become the replacement for Hudsucker, acting as the proxy where the company's stock would deflate at the appointment of an inexperienced and incompetent president. Across town, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist for the Manhattan Argus had successfully gone undercover working as a personal secretary for Barnes, pretending to be another desperate graduate from Muncie. In actual fact, she was assigned to do a profile of Barnes. Along the way, she would come to see how Barnes had been transformed as a person after his idea of the hula hoop take off across the country, going against what Mussburger and the board had thought the invention would depress the company stock. This can be seen as a film of about reversal of fortunes, of how Barnes went from the mailroom clerk to the company president and how he nearly went back to how it all started for him before being saved by an unlikely source. It is what would happen towards the ending which brings one full circle of what happened at the beginning of the film. Overall, it is a fairly enjoyable film, if one likes to root for the underdog which in this case is Barnes with the exception of what happened when the hula hoop invention changed his fortune.

    I have seen The Hud a half dozen times and it never gets old. From the opening sequence to the closing musical score this film keeps me enraptured. The art directing, the costumes, the music, the script all work together to make a movie of unprecedented beauty. Tim Robbins is perfect in this role and the supporting cast all come off the screen as unforgettable characters I proudly tell anyone who asks that this is my favorite film of all times. Sure, sure, art is subjective and some people do not care for such films. I feel sorry for them. This is a perfect film.

    I love the Coen brothers, and being a lesser Coen brother movie is hard, because all there others are so dang brilliant. The Hudsucker Proxy is a prime example of this. It's a good, funny movie, but watching it in the line-up the most the Coen brothers' other work, it's just a little weak. There are some great things about this flick though, for example the cinematography and visual look of the movie is totally awesome, and I really liked the film's premise/themes. The only thing I really didn't care for in this movie was Jennifer Jason Leigh... her character was annoying to me. The Hudsucker Proxy is definitely worth watching, and if you're a hardcore fan of the Coen brothers like myself, I think you'll enjoy and appreciate this underrated gem.

And when drama, there is, it only plays as set-ups from some screwball situations, the opening with Norville Barnes trying to jump from the Hudsucker's high clock is a reminiscence of John Doe's character (Gary Cooper) in "Meet John Doe", but I defy anyone to claim that he saw the resolution coming. Not to say that it would satisfy all the viewers, but still, it fits the film's surrealistic touch to the film, with all flash and style, but not without substance. Granted "The Hudsucker Proxy" isn't "Metropolis", "The Crowd" or "Brazil" but by its stylistic recreation of these iconic setting, leverage our thoughts to the more satirical material. Maybe it's too far-fetched, but I didn't think the film needed to speak explicit statement against savage capitalism; the point is smoothly made without distracting from the slapstick and screwball material. The assumption of 'all flash and no substance' isn't totally irrelevant but with such flashy brilliance and such great dialogs, the film can't be branded as unsubstantial. It's classy, surrealist, and funny and much more, it succeeds to put all these qualities together, something a few films can pretend to achieve. And on a more basic level, the film is so damn funny. I laughed, I laughed a lot. Maybe not as much as in the first act, but the laughs were equally combined with true satire and a dazzling photography, served by superb performances. The film works both on the surface and its content. I wish I could say more, I wish my vocabulary would be richer, but all I can do is summarize the film by paraphrasing its repeated line "you know, for laughs" That's what it is, a movie made for laughs, and the rest is just a delightful cinematic experience, something fresh made out of familiar material. Basically, the Coen brothers did the same than Norville Barnes: they reinvented the wheel.

    It is two weeks before the New Year of 1959. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) has arrived in New York City looking for a job after his graduation from college in Muncie, Indiana. With no working experience, he found himself working at the mailroom of the Hudsucker Industries. On the same day, the company's founder and president Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) unexpectedly committed suicide by jumping off from the top-floor window despite the company had been doing well financially. Back at the mailroom, there is the arrival of the 'Blue Letter' which Barnes had been assigned to hand it personally to Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), a member of the board of directors. When Barnes did eventually meet Mussburger, he would forget about the letter he was supposed to deliver and began talking about the new invention he had for the company. Mussburger would eventually decide to let Barnes become the replacement for Hudsucker, acting as the proxy where the company's stock would deflate at the appointment of an inexperienced and incompetent president. Across town, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist for the Manhattan Argus had successfully gone undercover working as a personal secretary for Barnes, pretending to be another desperate graduate from Muncie. In actual fact, she was assigned to do a profile of Barnes. Along the way, she would come to see how Barnes had been transformed as a person after his idea of the hula hoop take off across the country, going against what Mussburger and the board had thought the invention would depress the company stock. This can be seen as a film of about reversal of fortunes, of how Barnes went from the mailroom clerk to the company president and how he nearly went back to how it all started for him before being saved by an unlikely source. It is what would happen towards the ending which brings one full circle of what happened at the beginning of the film. Overall, it is a fairly enjoyable film, if one likes to root for the underdog which in this case is Barnes with the exception of what happened when the hula hoop invention changed his fortune.

    I have seen The Hud a half dozen times and it never gets old. From the opening sequence to the closing musical score this film keeps me enraptured. The art directing, the costumes, the music, the script all work together to make a movie of unprecedented beauty. Tim Robbins is perfect in this role and the supporting cast all come off the screen as unforgettable characters I proudly tell anyone who asks that this is my favorite film of all times. Sure, sure, art is subjective and some people do not care for such films. I feel sorry for them. This is a perfect film.

    I love the Coen brothers, and being a lesser Coen brother movie is hard, because all there others are so dang brilliant. The Hudsucker Proxy is a prime example of this. It's a good, funny movie, but watching it in the line-up the most the Coen brothers' other work, it's just a little weak. There are some great things about this flick though, for example the cinematography and visual look of the movie is totally awesome, and I really liked the film's premise/themes. The only thing I really didn't care for in this movie was Jennifer Jason Leigh... her character was annoying to me. The Hudsucker Proxy is definitely worth watching, and if you're a hardcore fan of the Coen brothers like myself, I think you'll enjoy and appreciate this underrated gem.

    It fills me with really great satisfaction to see such an excellently made and acted movie. Every word, scene, prop, and symbol are perfectly blended into one great awesome package. It's incredibly funny, a as matter of fact it has one of the longest funny scenes I have ever seen in my life, and not a word is spoken in it. Kudos to everyone in this film, directing is amazing, the visualization magnificent. It's hilarious, yet thoughtful, morally uplifting, educational, proves a very valid point, and was released in 1994. I want to thank my friend for watching it with me immediately upon learning that I had not seen it before. Simply, wow and a whole lot of whohohohohohahahahahhaohohohoho!!!!!........

    I am not really sure what is it about this movie that makes it so addictive and lovable. I've seen it many times and sometimes I just listen to it and always enjoyed it. I believe this is a kind of movie which only can be made by ones who really love cinema, you know someone like Tornatore, and I think Cohen brothers are those kind of people. The movie seems so perfect to me that I can't find even one negative point. It really makes me wonder how come a movie which didn't grab much attention and was considered a box office bomb could be otherwise a master piece. This movie is certainly among the top 5 best movies I've ever seen!

    I usually like the Cohen brothers movies and I know how they like to make unusual screw ball type comedy but this one was just too over the top for me. I know if was supposed to be that was and it was supposed to be campy but just not my style. Its like a serious movie thats made for little kids it almost seems. It seems a like a movie on YTV or something. This movie is about a college graduate on the lowest end of a huge corporation. The copration hatches this plan to hire a new CEO and make sure hes very dumb so the company stock falls. They want to do this so they can afford all the stock to themselvs. This movie was not all bad but one of the worst Cohen brothers movies and that pains me to say because I am a huge fan of Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou and No country for Old men. If you like quirky comedies this one you will like or if you just love the humor of the Cohen brothers and if you do you know it.

    The Coen Brothers' reputation for stylistic excess was never as well earned as here. Obviously aiming for the feel of a Preston Sturges classic comedy, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a stridently acted, indifferently written display of cinematic excess. Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) lands in New York City just off the bus from Muncie, Indiana, looking for a job. Just as he gives up hope, a job literally falls from the sky, that of chief executive of cash-loaded Hudsucker Industries. Its CEO/Founder Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) "merges with the infinite" by taking a header from the 44th floor, leaving his board with a lot of precious loose stock to claim. Board member Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) decides the best solution is to bring the stock price down, quick, and grab up what the market dumps. "Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue," Mussburger sneers. "What we need now is a new president who will inspire panic in the stockholder." After Barnes nearly sets fire to Mussburger's office, the old snake figures he's found just the guy. Newman's unique here in that he doesn't spit out his lines rapid-fire out of the side of his mouth like William Demarest with lockjaw or any of Newman's castmates in this movie. He kind of growls and barks instead, offering terrific Newman presence but working against the little comedy there is, which mostly centers on how rough the business world is and how it victimizes the little guy. It's a Sturges story that way at least. Except when Newman's on the screen, "Hudsucker Proxy" is a kind of movie that can give you whiplash just from the subtitles. Most egregious in this regard is Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays an undercover reporter by cross-channeling Rosalind Russell-meets-Katharine Hepburn. It's fun to watch her for a minute or two even with her lines obviously dubbed in at points, but watching her flap her hands around and rant in what might as well be Esperanto for minutes at a time gets tired. "Hudsucker" itself seems to work with the idea the faster it moves, the more clever it is. Or maybe it's just trying to bull you though a sketchy plot. Once Barnes plays his and the movie's one ace, revealing this invention which he has been touting since the opening credits, he becomes a heel and a bore. Barnes should offer an engaging center, but doesn't because of both a lacking script Ethan and director Joel Coen wrote with horror-film legend Sam Raimi and because of Robbins' overly broad performance. By the time the movie gets to the end, you can feel the writers shrugging their collective shoulders. "You got a better idea?" a character asks us directly at one point, a funny moment but also an admission that they did not. Stylistically, "Hudsucker Proxy" is fun to look at, with its stereotypical 1950s production design run amuck. Engaging piecework from Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney as a pair of hard-case journalists and Peter Gallagher as a thinly-disguised Dean Martin mean good things turn up now and again. The Carter Burwell score plays off the melody of "Stormy Weather" before launching into some engaging thematic material of its own. "Hudsucker" is ultimately a film that exists to show off its influences, and be judged by comparison. That these guys love Preston Sturges is clear here; that they picked up on his screen economy, witty dialogue, and razor-sharp characterizations is better demonstrated by their other movies.

    Tim Robbins is a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries when the president of the company jumps out the window to his death. Norville(Robbins) is the chosen successor by way of the maneuvering of a board member, Stanley Mussberger(Paul Newman). Stanley is looking to depress the stock price for an easy takeover and Norville is his means of accomplishing this. Norville shocks everyone by inventing the hula hoop which becomes a huge seller with kids. Stanley continues to plot against his naive young man and the Coen boys turn to fantasy for the second half of this 1950's style screwball comedy in the tradition of Preston Sturges. It is a worthy entry which I would rank a notch below the masterpiece, "Fargo," my personal favorite.

    As most of the Coen brother's movies I've seen, I came out of this one confused and still unsure if I had liked it or hated it. It's a good movie, it's fun and makes you laugh in some ways that might be considered dumb. But after a few minutes you realise that it has a great history, and you end up surprised about how good it actually is. What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the environment created. An environment filled with stereotyped business man, with enlarged characterised faces and behaviour, which I simply found marvellous. Followed by the non-surprising surprising twists and turns, again, typical of every Coen Brother's film, this movie came out as a good but not great movie. I do recommend it for the story and environment created. So watch it, you'll be pleased, surprised and amused.

    After watching "The Hudsucker Proxy" again, and reading Roger Ebert's review (again), I lamentably admit that I'm totally out of words. The film is so incongruously appealing that I feel my review should match the same level of creativeness and wonder it brought on the screen. But seriously, what more can I say about the Coen brothers' "The Hudsucker Proxy" that it's one of the best-looking comedies ever. There are many moments in the film, (in fact, quite every time) where I felt myself wondering if I had to keep track on the story or my eyes on the dazzling looks it offered: from the beautiful panoramic shots of majestic and creepy Babel-Tower like skyscrapers or the sumptuous recreation of the Big Corporations' inside rooms with never-ending tables as vertiginous as the buildings, from a horizontal perspective. Roger Deakins' geometric cinematography is absolutely breath-taking and rather than being put for the only 'eye-pleasing' purpose, works as the setting of some spectacular scenes. The most notable one is the opening where the respected President, Waring Hudsucker, played by the late Charles Durning, decides to make the big dive, fed up of all that business mumbo-jumbo he had to endure his all life. That long jump and long is an understatement (Hudsucker even finds time to tell people on the ground to move away), is weirdly convincing and hilarious through the anticlimactic slap at the end, the obligatory fat-ugly woman screaming and the verbal aftermath carried by heartless board members and their ruthless leader, Sidney Mussburger, played by Paul Newman. The jump scene sums up the film's appeal: it looks great and makes you laugh. And naturally, if you're a fan of Frank Capra's classics where greedy corporate businessman use a naive and idealistic schmuck to fulfill some evil schemes, and all the subsequent archetypes: spinning closes-up on newspapers headlines, nosy and noisy journalists and the snappy wisecracking workaholic female who'll get infatuated on the goodhearted fool she investigates on (Tim Robbins is perfect as the well-meaning Norville Barnes), comic-reliefs sidekicks and all that stuff, well, if you look at Hollywood Golden Age with nostalgic eyes, "The Hudsucker Proxy" will be familiar territory for you. And that Capraesque touch clearly helps to appreciate the film. Indeed, that half-homage and half-parody approach constitutes a solid platform on which the improbability of the story can efficiently evolve. And for some strange reasons, to which the Coen brothers only know the secret, each actor, by playing his character in the required over-the-top way, gave them that touch of believability for the film's bizarre poetry. I concede it takes time to get into some characters, I for once, thought Jennifer Lason Leigh was unbearable as the journalist, now, I can't see how her performance could have worked differently. The point is not that she impersonated Katharine Hepburn or Rosalind Russell well or badly, but that she was 'impersonating'. It's a film firmly aware of its 'cinematicality'. Naturally, the film isn't beyond criticism for all that. Many would argue that its very attention to great designs and magnificent looking details give a touch of seriousness inducing more serious expectations regarding the plot. My agreement with Ebert concerns the way the poster spoiled what would have been one hell of a middle-plot twist. I'm talking of course of the circle that would be revealed as the hula-hoop. That basic circle, Norville Barnes showed to everyone, adding the repeated line "You know, for kids" as if it was supposed to give a clue, could have been the film's McGuffin since it's the very device that triggers Mussburger's desire to hire Barnes as the proxy, in order to depress the stock and buys all the company's interests, but what a great surprise it would have been to have that revealed in the middle of the film. Apart from that missed opportunity, the film works and never leaves any hint of a dramatic evolution of the story.

Engaging piecework from Bruce Campbell and John Mahoney as a pair of hard-case journalists and Peter Gallagher as a thinly-disguised Dean Martin mean good things turn up now and again. The Carter Burwell score plays off the melody of "Stormy Weather" before launching into some engaging thematic material of its own. "Hudsucker" is ultimately a film that exists to show off its influences, and be judged by comparison. That these guys love Preston Sturges is clear here; that they picked up on his screen economy, witty dialogue, and razor-sharp characterizations is better demonstrated by their other movies.

    Tim Robbins is a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries when the president of the company jumps out the window to his death. Norville(Robbins) is the chosen successor by way of the maneuvering of a board member, Stanley Mussberger(Paul Newman). Stanley is looking to depress the stock price for an easy takeover and Norville is his means of accomplishing this. Norville shocks everyone by inventing the hula hoop which becomes a huge seller with kids. Stanley continues to plot against his naive young man and the Coen boys turn to fantasy for the second half of this 1950's style screwball comedy in the tradition of Preston Sturges. It is a worthy entry which I would rank a notch below the masterpiece, "Fargo," my personal favorite.

    As most of the Coen brother's movies I've seen, I came out of this one confused and still unsure if I had liked it or hated it. It's a good movie, it's fun and makes you laugh in some ways that might be considered dumb. But after a few minutes you realise that it has a great history, and you end up surprised about how good it actually is. What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the environment created. An environment filled with stereotyped business man, with enlarged characterised faces and behaviour, which I simply found marvellous. Followed by the non-surprising surprising twists and turns, again, typical of every Coen Brother's film, this movie came out as a good but not great movie. I do recommend it for the story and environment created. So watch it, you'll be pleased, surprised and amused.
