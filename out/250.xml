 <sinopse>
  In the colorful future, a cab driver unwittingly becomes the central figure in the search for a legendary cosmic weapon to keep Evil and Mr Zorg at bay.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In the twenty-third century, the universe is threatened by evil. The only hope for mankind is the Fifth Element, who comes to Earth every five thousand years to protect the humans with four stones of the four elements: fire, water, Earth and air. A Mondoshawan spacecraft is bringing The Fifth Element back to Earth but it is destroyed by the evil Mangalores. However, a team of scientists use the DNA of the remains of the Fifth Element to rebuild the perfect being called Leeloo. She escapes from the laboratory and stumbles upon the taxi driver and former elite commando major Korben Dallas that helps her to escape from the police. Leeloo tells him that she must meet Father Vito Cornelius to accomplish her mission. Meanwhile, the Evil uses the greedy and cruel Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg and a team of mercenary Mangalores to retrieve the stones and avoid the protection of Leeloo. But the skilled Korben Dallas has fallen in love with Leeloo and decides to help her to retrieve the stones.

    The Fifth Element directed by Luc Besson is a movie unlike others. The classic "save the world/universe" storyline, done right. Many things are incorporated into this movie to make it every genre you could imagine. Mostly classified as a Sci-Fi, some may also say it is a comedy, action, or love movie. Luc Besson has managed to incorporate nature into the future. Many people see the future as chrome. This movie sees it as a ghetto, dirty place where greenery no longer flourishes. Fast food chains and major corporations rule, with practically no trees or natural monuments. A classic, one man, Korben Dallas, must save the future world from a certain doom and find love at the same time. The Fifth Element is a beautiful movie because of its unique presentation of a very common plot. Every save the world/universe movie we know ends and starts the same. A man or woman who is no longer part of any military or government-based program is chosen to save the world. They do not want to do it but they are the "only ones" on the earth who can do it. Of course, The Fifth Element takes this concept and uses it, but in a beautiful, never done before way. This movie uses the future with flying cars, unbelievable skyscrapers, space ships, and alien life, and shows a different take on it. These buildings, cars, and even people in major cities and not glamorous and glorified. They are worn-out, run down, and crummy. This is a more realistic interpretation of the future because of the way we are spiraling down. In this movie, Bruce Willis plays a man Korben Dallas, a simple city cab driver and ex-military man, who of course, must save the universe from a certain fatal death. He must go on a cruise ship to find these four "element stones" and use them with "the fifth element" to save the world from certain death. The antagonist, Zorg, and the protagonist, Korben, are all trying to find the stones to use them for good or to use them for evil. Korben, as well as Zorg, are one of many characters that you find make this movie what it is. Not only is the plot phenomenal, but the characters and their development with the plot as well. The characters in this movie are ones who form the plot to be what it is. I know it's the same in every movie, but for this one practically everyone plays a part. Leeloo, the love interest, is the supreme human being, or in other words, perfect. In this movie, she is first an alien of what is believed to be the divine race, and what is found of her remains becomes reconstructed in a laboratory where when she becomes "human" or looks to us what would be "normal", you find that she has bright orange hair, a thin figure, and a face with no-make up. Most people would find this unattractive, which is another reason I find this movie so beautiful. It shows true beauty in almost everything. There is another character named Ruby Rhod, who Korben is pretty much partnered up with after "winning" the contest hosted by Ruby to win the cruise tickets. Ruby is a radio show host, very popular; whom many would say is metrosexual. He cares very much about his looks and that his show goes well. I would like to think of Ruby as the comedy figure in this film. Other characters such as the priest, his assistant, and even the president all make this movie what it is and all tie it in together. Cornelius, the priest, and his assistant both play a huge role by telling the story of how the evil came to be. Zorg, who is the antagonist of the story, plays a beautiful part. His unique look and superb acting skills help this movie form. From the very beginning of the movie, he plays a very important role of telling what is going on, what he is doing, and how he's going to do it. There are so many beautiful things about this movie, from the actors and their characters, to the graphics and plot. This movie is a must see for everyone because of its wonderful rendition on a common and almost boring plot. In my opinion this movie is going to be a forever sci-fi, action classic. The Fifth Element has a great rendition on a common plot that made it what it is, which is, a beautiful movie.

    I was intrigued to watch this movie, checked the IMDb score beforehand and was looking forward to a good Bruce Willis sci-fi. Unfortunately, what i got was a passable opening ~40 minutes which dissolved into complete utter stupidity soon as Chris Tucker appeared on the scene. I could not believe the direction thought giving his character such a large role was a good idea. He takes over the movie and craps all over it. I hoped he would have a five minute side role, but no, he becomes a main character, given even more screen time than the interesting and attractive leeloo, and Bruce Willis. He is not funny, just fecking stupid and i wanted to shoot him and if i am honest i still do. How anyone can find this kind of humour funny is completely beyond me. Do you like screaming obnoxious loud uneducated black women that never shut their effing mouth? No? So why is it "funny", when a man portrays the same character? It isn't. If you are an intelligent person, don't listen to the majority score, the majority of people have 90IQ. For you, dignified human being, this movie is offensive in its stupidity.

    This is a great example why I dislike most of today's movies. Movies back then (80 ~ 90 and some of 00's) where more courageous, directors weren't afraid of craziness and nonsense. More art could be expressed, more challenging scenes! I miss this! This movie shows this things clearly, actors are very into this whole new universe and the universe itself is well developed. As a Isaac Asimov reader I approve this science fiction. Now lets talk specifics... I always write for you guys to help choosing this movie to watch, so this is why and when I think you should get this one: If you are into Sci-Fi get this movie, no matter what. It has some plot issues like things happening too fast and some weak comedy in scenes that don't need or match the requirements... but still this is a great Sci-Fi. You'll be able to enjoy even the lifestyle of the universe, the clothes, the environment, the mores. Just do it. As for any other, you should watch to experience a movie that doesn't work on the character development or on the people interactions but it develops an entire new universe so you can enjoy thinking of it. It may be your intro to Sci-Fi since it is a light Sci-Fi with easy to understand rules. Finally for the bads... This movie has some problems. Some times the scenes go too fast and it is somewhat hard to understand why somethings are to be that way. The movie doesn't end well too because of that, for some reason in the end near the climax, things start to solve really fast for idiotic reasons. That doesn't ruin the movie but instead shows how much potential it have if those were to be fixed. It deserves the 7 it has.

    The Fifth Element is a light hearted Sci-Fi adventure featuring Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. Directed by Luc Besson, it takes us through a story that blends faith, comedy and lots of things blowing up. The plot is simple: evil has been kept at bay by a mysterious priesthood for centuries. Now, that evil force has returned and the world must be protected. Evil, however, has other plans; with the greedy interference of a self-centred entrepreneur (played by Gary Oldman), Evil manages to all but destroy humanities only hope. In response, humanity sends in retired soldier Bruce Willis. The rest of the movie involves Bruce seeking out the Five Elements that will destroy evil and the assorted troubles and misadventures that result. Moving quickly, cleverly and with brilliant cohesion under Besson's capable direction, The Fifth Element is a great and vastly underrated film. With great visuals, excellent special effects and some very clever editing, it's a film well worth watching.

    I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but after watching "Leon" (and loved it) I wanted to see other Luc Besson projects. Well, it rarely happens, but this film exceeded my expectations! "The Fifth Element" was really amusing. The action scenes were not monumental, but they were fine. The performances of the actors were also delightful. The colourful setting and costumes (designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier) added a lot to the film, making it one of the most surprising and smart films I've seen for a while. Perhaps the film lacks a little suspense. I'd like to see some more of Oldman, too. I have not seen as many science fiction as I'd wish to, but I can understand why this movie polarized the critics. Nevertheless, I certainly recommend it to the fans of the genre.

    WOW! Stunningly visual and mind-blowing action! If you love science fiction, action, adventure, or just imagine what kind of cool stuff the future may hold for humankind - this is a must-see film. Much like the world of Blade Runner in the way the world looks and feels in the distant future - everything you could possibly love about science fiction, action, adventure, comedy, and even romance is right here! From the moment the movie begins, you know that you are going to be in for something magical and wonderful. I grew up reading Heavy Metal Magazine and enjoyed the animated motion picture as well. This movie brought together all of the incredible art and magic of those artist into a live action film with great acting and a brilliant story. Thank you, Luc Besson (and the artists that helped you) - you have created a brilliant work of art!

    *Possible spoilers ahead* Fear not for the future, folks, 'cause (get this!) in the 23rd Century a real bad-ass, cab-driving mama's boy is gonna kick some serious alien butt and save all of mankind from total annihilation. So, for the time being, you can all be rest assured that, thanks to Korben Dallas, we are safe from Alien Armageddon once again. Phew! That was a close one, though! Eh? Now, I wouldn't exactly say that The Fifth Element was the worst Sci-Fi movie ever made. No, I wouldn't say that. But I would say that it was most certainly one of the most unhinged, most sloppy and badly-paced of that particular genre which I've ever seen. Would I say that The Fifth Element was so bad that it was almost (but not quite) good? Yeah. Well, maybe I would. When it was revealed to me where the 4 Mystical Stones were being hidden I almost choked, as the Diva Plavalaguana must've when she snarfed them down for safe keeping. (Well, how else could she have gotten them inside her guts? - Unless she had shoved 'em up her big, blue keester) (snicker-snicker) I have to admit that it wasn't Willis's "Dallas" character who bugged me the most in this movie. There were actually 2 other contenders for the most despicable character who beat out Dallas by a long-shot. #1 was Gary Oldman's Zorg. Let's face it, Oldman just can't convincingly play a villain worth crap. Watching this snivelling wimp trying so desperately to appear evil was the same thing as if the part of Zorg had been given to PeeWee Herman. #2 most despicable character was (surprise-surprise) Ruby Rhod. OK. I'll admit that for the first time around this heterosexual-transvestite's schtick was actually kinda amusing. But when he returned for a 2nd performance he fell flat on his face with all of that fast-talking nonsense. Had the Ruby Rhod character been instrumental in helping Dallas save the day, then, yes, I would've easily forgiven his annoying presence. But all he turned out to be was a big, stupid suck who proved to be a deterrent to Dallas's gallant heroics. Thank goodness that director Luc Besson flatly refused to make a sequel to this disappointing film. And speaking about Besson, here's a little behind-the-scenes drama that might be of interest to some of you here at IMDb - Up to the beginning of The Fifth Element's production, Besson was a married man (of 6 years) to actress Maiwenn Le Besco, who played the "Diva" character. (She was also 16 years his junior). Once filming got underway Besson didn't waste any time to dump Le Besco like a hot potato and start bedding Milla Jovovich, whom he quickly married. (This blissful union of wedlock lasted for exactly 2 whole years. My-oh-my, isn't love just grand?) Like, can you just imagine all of the frickin' tension and ill-will that must've been going one during the production of this film with Besson's bed-hopping and these 2 women vying for his attention? Wow! That must've been a circus, and a half! P.S. - Oh, yeah. Another thing that lost this film points was its blatant product placement of the familiar McDonalds trademark shoved into my face.... Uh.... Do you really believe that this horrible fast-food franchise will still be around in the 23rd Century? I certainly hope not!

    The Fifth Element a sci-fi action extravaganza by Luc Besson. The good. Funny. Outrageous settings and costumes. Wildly imaginative technology and prognostics for the future. Lots of action. The actors. Bruce Willis is in his middle phase. Not his best performance, but still pretty good. Gary Oldman is right as the evil Zorg, the trash of humanity. Ian Holm give us a great performance as the overwhelmed and slightly klutzy priest. Milla Jovovich's role doesn't require much of her, but she's simply adorable. And finally, Chris Tucker is fantastic as the extremely annoying radio DJ. It takes a few times seeing the flick to get used to him, but he's just perfect. The bad. The story is your basic save the world concept, with the ultimate evil, the criminals helping out, and the good guys, which include the army. Nothing inventive there. The ugly. The pet is too obviously a puppet. The result. Lots of sci-fi fun.

    What I really like about The Fifth Element is that it has a little bit of everything in it. It's funny, it's exciting, it's goofy, it's over- the-top, it's campy (in a good way), it's sexy (i.e. Lee-Loo), it's romantic, it's action-packed. It's like one of those rare kind of sci-fi movie you hardly see nowadays. Bruce Willis is doing his thing as Korben Dallas, being the hero who saves the day and gets into all the action. But he and Milla Jovovich had very good, romantic chemistry between them. Jovovich as Lee-Loo was both sexy and sublime and she gave off some memorable lines like "Seno akta gama" or "Multi-pass" or "Big bada boom." Gary Oldman gave a very good performance as the villain but I didn't like the way he was killed in the end. But the only character that I really didn't like was Chris Tucker's performance as Ruby Rhoad. He was probably put in for comedy but he was very annoying and very unfunny and his character felt pretty unnecessary. But the special effects and action scenes are well done. I'm surprised I never heard of this movie until I saw it just a couple of years ago. I'm sure it was a hit when it first came out in 1997 but it deserves more credit and should be appreciated and mentioned more. I would've even liked to have seen a sequel of it too but that doesn't seem likely, unfortunately. But The Fifth Element is an overall 8/10.

    Did I say, "One of my all-time favourites?" Well, I meant it, "Was, Now & Ever Shall Be!" Anything more has already been said, other than we've got the 2-DVD Special Edition version & on the movie Disk 1, if you ever get bored rewatching The Fifth Element, choose the Fact Track menu option. Sweet! Not only does it add lots of actually interesting trivia to the film from Credits onwards, but it also forces a whole new level of attention span to what you think you've seen before. You just never know where or when the trivia text will appear on screen & so your eyes will reappraise peripheral viewpoints all over again. Fresh & new, yeah. Excellent... always.

    WOW! Stunningly visual and mind-blowing action! If you love science fiction, action, adventure, or just imagine what kind of cool stuff the future may hold for humankind - this is a must-see film. Much like the world of Blade Runner in the way the world looks and feels in the distant future - everything you could possibly love about science fiction, action, adventure, comedy, and even romance is right here! From the moment the movie begins, you know that you are going to be in for something magical and wonderful. I grew up reading Heavy Metal Magazine and enjoyed the animated motion picture as well. This movie brought together all of the incredible art and magic of those artist into a live action film with great acting and a brilliant story. Thank you, Luc Besson (and the artists that helped you) - you have created a brilliant work of art!

    *Possible spoilers ahead* Fear not for the future, folks, 'cause (get this!) in the 23rd Century a real bad-ass, cab-driving mama's boy is gonna kick some serious alien butt and save all of mankind from total annihilation. So, for the time being, you can all be rest assured that, thanks to Korben Dallas, we are safe from Alien Armageddon once again. Phew! That was a close one, though! Eh? Now, I wouldn't exactly say that The Fifth Element was the worst Sci-Fi movie ever made. No, I wouldn't say that. But I would say that it was most certainly one of the most unhinged, most sloppy and badly-paced of that particular genre which I've ever seen. Would I say that The Fifth Element was so bad that it was almost (but not quite) good? Yeah. Well, maybe I would. When it was revealed to me where the 4 Mystical Stones were being hidden I almost choked, as the Diva Plavalaguana must've when she snarfed them down for safe keeping. (Well, how else could she have gotten them inside her guts? - Unless she had shoved 'em up her big, blue keester) (snicker-snicker) I have to admit that it wasn't Willis's "Dallas" character who bugged me the most in this movie. There were actually 2 other contenders for the most despicable character who beat out Dallas by a long-shot. #1 was Gary Oldman's Zorg. Let's face it, Oldman just can't convincingly play a villain worth crap. Watching this snivelling wimp trying so desperately to appear evil was the same thing as if the part of Zorg had been given to PeeWee Herman. #2 most despicable character was (surprise-surprise) Ruby Rhod. OK. I'll admit that for the first time around this heterosexual-transvestite's schtick was actually kinda amusing. But when he returned for a 2nd performance he fell flat on his face with all of that fast-talking nonsense. Had the Ruby Rhod character been instrumental in helping Dallas save the day, then, yes, I would've easily forgiven his annoying presence. But all he turned out to be was a big, stupid suck who proved to be a deterrent to Dallas's gallant heroics. Thank goodness that director Luc Besson flatly refused to make a sequel to this disappointing film. And speaking about Besson, here's a little behind-the-scenes drama that might be of interest to some of you here at IMDb - Up to the beginning of The Fifth Element's production, Besson was a married man (of 6 years) to actress Maiwenn Le Besco, who played the "Diva" character. (She was also 16 years his junior). Once filming got underway Besson didn't waste any time to dump Le Besco like a hot potato and start bedding Milla Jovovich, whom he quickly married. (This blissful union of wedlock lasted for exactly 2 whole years. My-oh-my, isn't love just grand?) Like, can you just imagine all of the frickin' tension and ill-will that must've been going one during the production of this film with Besson's bed-hopping and these 2 women vying for his attention? Wow! That must've been a circus, and a half! P.S. - Oh, yeah. Another thing that lost this film points was its blatant product placement of the familiar McDonalds trademark shoved into my face.... Uh.... Do you really believe that this horrible fast-food franchise will still be around in the 23rd Century? I certainly hope not!

    The Fifth Element a sci-fi action extravaganza by Luc Besson. The good. Funny. Outrageous settings and costumes. Wildly imaginative technology and prognostics for the future. Lots of action. The actors. Bruce Willis is in his middle phase. Not his best performance, but still pretty good. Gary Oldman is right as the evil Zorg, the trash of humanity. Ian Holm give us a great performance as the overwhelmed and slightly klutzy priest. Milla Jovovich's role doesn't require much of her, but she's simply adorable. And finally, Chris Tucker is fantastic as the extremely annoying radio DJ. It takes a few times seeing the flick to get used to him, but he's just perfect. The bad. The story is your basic save the world concept, with the ultimate evil, the criminals helping out, and the good guys, which include the army. Nothing inventive there. The ugly. The pet is too obviously a puppet. The result. Lots of sci-fi fun.

    What I really like about The Fifth Element is that it has a little bit of everything in it. It's funny, it's exciting, it's goofy, it's over- the-top, it's campy (in a good way), it's sexy (i.e. Lee-Loo), it's romantic, it's action-packed. It's like one of those rare kind of sci-fi movie you hardly see nowadays. Bruce Willis is doing his thing as Korben Dallas, being the hero who saves the day and gets into all the action. But he and Milla Jovovich had very good, romantic chemistry between them. Jovovich as Lee-Loo was both sexy and sublime and she gave off some memorable lines like "Seno akta gama" or "Multi-pass" or "Big bada boom." Gary Oldman gave a very good performance as the villain but I didn't like the way he was killed in the end. But the only character that I really didn't like was Chris Tucker's performance as Ruby Rhoad. He was probably put in for comedy but he was very annoying and very unfunny and his character felt pretty unnecessary. But the special effects and action scenes are well done. I'm surprised I never heard of this movie until I saw it just a couple of years ago. I'm sure it was a hit when it first came out in 1997 but it deserves more credit and should be appreciated and mentioned more. I would've even liked to have seen a sequel of it too but that doesn't seem likely, unfortunately. But The Fifth Element is an overall 8/10.

Anything more has already been said, other than we've got the 2-DVD Special Edition version & on the movie Disk 1, if you ever get bored rewatching The Fifth Element, choose the Fact Track menu option. Sweet! Not only does it add lots of actually interesting trivia to the film from Credits onwards, but it also forces a whole new level of attention span to what you think you've seen before. You just never know where or when the trivia text will appear on screen & so your eyes will reappraise peripheral viewpoints all over again. Fresh & new, yeah. Excellent... always.

    The Fifth Element directed by Luc Besson is a movie unlike others. The classic "save the world/universe" storyline, done right. Many things are incorporated into this movie to make it every genre you could imagine. Mostly classified as a Sci-Fi, some may also say it is a comedy, action, or love movie. Luc Besson has managed to incorporate nature into the future. Many people see the future as chrome. This movie sees it as a ghetto, dirty place where greenery no longer flourishes. Fast food chains and major corporations rule, with practically no trees or natural monuments. A classic, one man, Korben Dallas, must save the future world from a certain doom and find love at the same time. The Fifth Element is a beautiful movie because of its unique presentation of a very common plot. Every save the world/universe movie we know ends and starts the same. A man or woman who is no longer part of any military or government-based program is chosen to save the world. They do not want to do it but they are the "only ones" on the earth who can do it. Of course, The Fifth Element takes this concept and uses it, but in a beautiful, never done before way. This movie uses the future with flying cars, unbelievable skyscrapers, space ships, and alien life, and shows a different take on it. These buildings, cars, and even people in major cities and not glamorous and glorified. They are worn-out, run down, and crummy. This is a more realistic interpretation of the future because of the way we are spiraling down. In this movie, Bruce Willis plays a man Korben Dallas, a simple city cab driver and ex-military man, who of course, must save the universe from a certain fatal death. He must go on a cruise ship to find these four "element stones" and use them with "the fifth element" to save the world from certain death. The antagonist, Zorg, and the protagonist, Korben, are all trying to find the stones to use them for good or to use them for evil. Korben, as well as Zorg, are one of many characters that you find make this movie what it is. Not only is the plot phenomenal, but the characters and their development with the plot as well. The characters in this movie are ones who form the plot to be what it is. I know it's the same in every movie, but for this one practically everyone plays a part. Leeloo, the love interest, is the supreme human being, or in other words, perfect. In this movie, she is first an alien of what is believed to be the divine race, and what is found of her remains becomes reconstructed in a laboratory where when she becomes "human" or looks to us what would be "normal", you find that she has bright orange hair, a thin figure, and a face with no-make up. Most people would find this unattractive, which is another reason I find this movie so beautiful. It shows true beauty in almost everything. There is another character named Ruby Rhod, who Korben is pretty much partnered up with after "winning" the contest hosted by Ruby to win the cruise tickets. Ruby is a radio show host, very popular; whom many would say is metrosexual. He cares very much about his looks and that his show goes well. I would like to think of Ruby as the comedy figure in this film. Other characters such as the priest, his assistant, and even the president all make this movie what it is and all tie it in together. Cornelius, the priest, and his assistant both play a huge role by telling the story of how the evil came to be. Zorg, who is the antagonist of the story, plays a beautiful part. His unique look and superb acting skills help this movie form. From the very beginning of the movie, he plays a very important role of telling what is going on, what he is doing, and how he's going to do it. There are so many beautiful things about this movie, from the actors and their characters, to the graphics and plot. This movie is a must see for everyone because of its wonderful rendition on a common and almost boring plot. In my opinion this movie is going to be a forever sci-fi, action classic. The Fifth Element has a great rendition on a common plot that made it what it is, which is, a beautiful movie.

    I was intrigued to watch this movie, checked the IMDb score beforehand and was looking forward to a good Bruce Willis sci-fi. Unfortunately, what i got was a passable opening ~40 minutes which dissolved into complete utter stupidity soon as Chris Tucker appeared on the scene. I could not believe the direction thought giving his character such a large role was a good idea. He takes over the movie and craps all over it. I hoped he would have a five minute side role, but no, he becomes a main character, given even more screen time than the interesting and attractive leeloo, and Bruce Willis. He is not funny, just fecking stupid and i wanted to shoot him and if i am honest i still do. How anyone can find this kind of humour funny is completely beyond me. Do you like screaming obnoxious loud uneducated black women that never shut their effing mouth? No? So why is it "funny", when a man portrays the same character? It isn't. If you are an intelligent person, don't listen to the majority score, the majority of people have 90IQ. For you, dignified human being, this movie is offensive in its stupidity.

    This is a great example why I dislike most of today's movies. Movies back then (80 ~ 90 and some of 00's) where more courageous, directors weren't afraid of craziness and nonsense. More art could be expressed, more challenging scenes! I miss this! This movie shows this things clearly, actors are very into this whole new universe and the universe itself is well developed. As a Isaac Asimov reader I approve this science fiction. Now lets talk specifics... I always write for you guys to help choosing this movie to watch, so this is why and when I think you should get this one: If you are into Sci-Fi get this movie, no matter what. It has some plot issues like things happening too fast and some weak comedy in scenes that don't need or match the requirements... but still this is a great Sci-Fi. You'll be able to enjoy even the lifestyle of the universe, the clothes, the environment, the mores. Just do it. As for any other, you should watch to experience a movie that doesn't work on the character development or on the people interactions but it develops an entire new universe so you can enjoy thinking of it. It may be your intro to Sci-Fi since it is a light Sci-Fi with easy to understand rules. Finally for the bads... This movie has some problems. Some times the scenes go too fast and it is somewhat hard to understand why somethings are to be that way. The movie doesn't end well too because of that, for some reason in the end near the climax, things start to solve really fast for idiotic reasons. That doesn't ruin the movie but instead shows how much potential it have if those were to be fixed. It deserves the 7 it has.

    The Fifth Element is a light hearted Sci-Fi adventure featuring Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. Directed by Luc Besson, it takes us through a story that blends faith, comedy and lots of things blowing up. The plot is simple: evil has been kept at bay by a mysterious priesthood for centuries. Now, that evil force has returned and the world must be protected. Evil, however, has other plans; with the greedy interference of a self-centred entrepreneur (played by Gary Oldman), Evil manages to all but destroy humanities only hope. In response, humanity sends in retired soldier Bruce Willis. The rest of the movie involves Bruce seeking out the Five Elements that will destroy evil and the assorted troubles and misadventures that result. Moving quickly, cleverly and with brilliant cohesion under Besson's capable direction, The Fifth Element is a great and vastly underrated film. With great visuals, excellent special effects and some very clever editing, it's a film well worth watching.

    I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but after watching "Leon" (and loved it) I wanted to see other Luc Besson projects. Well, it rarely happens, but this film exceeded my expectations! "The Fifth Element" was really amusing. The action scenes were not monumental, but they were fine. The performances of the actors were also delightful. The colourful setting and costumes (designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier) added a lot to the film, making it one of the most surprising and smart films I've seen for a while. Perhaps the film lacks a little suspense. I'd like to see some more of Oldman, too. I have not seen as many science fiction as I'd wish to, but I can understand why this movie polarized the critics. Nevertheless, I certainly recommend it to the fans of the genre.

The Fifth Element has a great rendition on a common plot that made it what it is, which is, a beautiful movie.

    I was intrigued to watch this movie, checked the IMDb score beforehand and was looking forward to a good Bruce Willis sci-fi. Unfortunately, what i got was a passable opening ~40 minutes which dissolved into complete utter stupidity soon as Chris Tucker appeared on the scene. I could not believe the direction thought giving his character such a large role was a good idea. He takes over the movie and craps all over it. I hoped he would have a five minute side role, but no, he becomes a main character, given even more screen time than the interesting and attractive leeloo, and Bruce Willis. He is not funny, just fecking stupid and i wanted to shoot him and if i am honest i still do. How anyone can find this kind of humour funny is completely beyond me. Do you like screaming obnoxious loud uneducated black women that never shut their effing mouth? No? So why is it "funny", when a man portrays the same character? It isn't. If you are an intelligent person, don't listen to the majority score, the majority of people have 90IQ. For you, dignified human being, this movie is offensive in its stupidity.

    This is a great example why I dislike most of today's movies. Movies back then (80 ~ 90 and some of 00's) where more courageous, directors weren't afraid of craziness and nonsense. More art could be expressed, more challenging scenes! I miss this! This movie shows this things clearly, actors are very into this whole new universe and the universe itself is well developed. As a Isaac Asimov reader I approve this science fiction. Now lets talk specifics... I always write for you guys to help choosing this movie to watch, so this is why and when I think you should get this one: If you are into Sci-Fi get this movie, no matter what. It has some plot issues like things happening too fast and some weak comedy in scenes that don't need or match the requirements... but still this is a great Sci-Fi. You'll be able to enjoy even the lifestyle of the universe, the clothes, the environment, the mores. Just do it. As for any other, you should watch to experience a movie that doesn't work on the character development or on the people interactions but it develops an entire new universe so you can enjoy thinking of it. It may be your intro to Sci-Fi since it is a light Sci-Fi with easy to understand rules. Finally for the bads... This movie has some problems. Some times the scenes go too fast and it is somewhat hard to understand why somethings are to be that way. The movie doesn't end well too because of that, for some reason in the end near the climax, things start to solve really fast for idiotic reasons. That doesn't ruin the movie but instead shows how much potential it have if those were to be fixed. It deserves the 7 it has.

    The Fifth Element is a light hearted Sci-Fi adventure featuring Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. Directed by Luc Besson, it takes us through a story that blends faith, comedy and lots of things blowing up. The plot is simple: evil has been kept at bay by a mysterious priesthood for centuries. Now, that evil force has returned and the world must be protected. Evil, however, has other plans; with the greedy interference of a self-centred entrepreneur (played by Gary Oldman), Evil manages to all but destroy humanities only hope. In response, humanity sends in retired soldier Bruce Willis. The rest of the movie involves Bruce seeking out the Five Elements that will destroy evil and the assorted troubles and misadventures that result. Moving quickly, cleverly and with brilliant cohesion under Besson's capable direction, The Fifth Element is a great and vastly underrated film. With great visuals, excellent special effects and some very clever editing, it's a film well worth watching.

    I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but after watching "Leon" (and loved it) I wanted to see other Luc Besson projects. Well, it rarely happens, but this film exceeded my expectations! "The Fifth Element" was really amusing. The action scenes were not monumental, but they were fine. The performances of the actors were also delightful. The colourful setting and costumes (designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier) added a lot to the film, making it one of the most surprising and smart films I've seen for a while. Perhaps the film lacks a little suspense. I'd like to see some more of Oldman, too. I have not seen as many science fiction as I'd wish to, but I can understand why this movie polarized the critics. Nevertheless, I certainly recommend it to the fans of the genre.

    WOW! Stunningly visual and mind-blowing action! If you love science fiction, action, adventure, or just imagine what kind of cool stuff the future may hold for humankind - this is a must-see film. Much like the world of Blade Runner in the way the world looks and feels in the distant future - everything you could possibly love about science fiction, action, adventure, comedy, and even romance is right here! From the moment the movie begins, you know that you are going to be in for something magical and wonderful. I grew up reading Heavy Metal Magazine and enjoyed the animated motion picture as well. This movie brought together all of the incredible art and magic of those artist into a live action film with great acting and a brilliant story. Thank you, Luc Besson (and the artists that helped you) - you have created a brilliant work of art!

    *Possible spoilers ahead* Fear not for the future, folks, 'cause (get this!) in the 23rd Century a real bad-ass, cab-driving mama's boy is gonna kick some serious alien butt and save all of mankind from total annihilation. So, for the time being, you can all be rest assured that, thanks to Korben Dallas, we are safe from Alien Armageddon once again. Phew! That was a close one, though! Eh? Now, I wouldn't exactly say that The Fifth Element was the worst Sci-Fi movie ever made. No, I wouldn't say that. But I would say that it was most certainly one of the most unhinged, most sloppy and badly-paced of that particular genre which I've ever seen. Would I say that The Fifth Element was so bad that it was almost (but not quite) good? Yeah. Well, maybe I would. When it was revealed to me where the 4 Mystical Stones were being hidden I almost choked, as the Diva Plavalaguana must've when she snarfed them down for safe keeping. (Well, how else could she have gotten them inside her guts? - Unless she had shoved 'em up her big, blue keester) (snicker-snicker) I have to admit that it wasn't Willis's "Dallas" character who bugged me the most in this movie. There were actually 2 other contenders for the most despicable character who beat out Dallas by a long-shot. #1 was Gary Oldman's Zorg. Let's face it, Oldman just can't convincingly play a villain worth crap. Watching this snivelling wimp trying so desperately to appear evil was the same thing as if the part of Zorg had been given to PeeWee Herman. #2 most despicable character was (surprise-surprise) Ruby Rhod. OK. I'll admit that for the first time around this heterosexual-transvestite's schtick was actually kinda amusing. But when he returned for a 2nd performance he fell flat on his face with all of that fast-talking nonsense. Had the Ruby Rhod character been instrumental in helping Dallas save the day, then, yes, I would've easily forgiven his annoying presence. But all he turned out to be was a big, stupid suck who proved to be a deterrent to Dallas's gallant heroics. Thank goodness that director Luc Besson flatly refused to make a sequel to this disappointing film. And speaking about Besson, here's a little behind-the-scenes drama that might be of interest to some of you here at IMDb - Up to the beginning of The Fifth Element's production, Besson was a married man (of 6 years) to actress Maiwenn Le Besco, who played the "Diva" character. (She was also 16 years his junior). Once filming got underway Besson didn't waste any time to dump Le Besco like a hot potato and start bedding Milla Jovovich, whom he quickly married. (This blissful union of wedlock lasted for exactly 2 whole years. My-oh-my, isn't love just grand?) Like, can you just imagine all of the frickin' tension and ill-will that must've been going one during the production of this film with Besson's bed-hopping and these 2 women vying for his attention? Wow! That must've been a circus, and a half! P.S. - Oh, yeah. Another thing that lost this film points was its blatant product placement of the familiar McDonalds trademark shoved into my face.... Uh.... Do you really believe that this horrible fast-food franchise will still be around in the 23rd Century? I certainly hope not!

    The Fifth Element a sci-fi action extravaganza by Luc Besson. The good. Funny. Outrageous settings and costumes. Wildly imaginative technology and prognostics for the future. Lots of action. The actors. Bruce Willis is in his middle phase. Not his best performance, but still pretty good. Gary Oldman is right as the evil Zorg, the trash of humanity. Ian Holm give us a great performance as the overwhelmed and slightly klutzy priest. Milla Jovovich's role doesn't require much of her, but she's simply adorable. And finally, Chris Tucker is fantastic as the extremely annoying radio DJ. It takes a few times seeing the flick to get used to him, but he's just perfect. The bad. The story is your basic save the world concept, with the ultimate evil, the criminals helping out, and the good guys, which include the army. Nothing inventive there. The ugly. The pet is too obviously a puppet. The result. Lots of sci-fi fun.

    What I really like about The Fifth Element is that it has a little bit of everything in it. It's funny, it's exciting, it's goofy, it's over- the-top, it's campy (in a good way), it's sexy (i.e. Lee-Loo), it's romantic, it's action-packed. It's like one of those rare kind of sci-fi movie you hardly see nowadays. Bruce Willis is doing his thing as Korben Dallas, being the hero who saves the day and gets into all the action. But he and Milla Jovovich had very good, romantic chemistry between them. Jovovich as Lee-Loo was both sexy and sublime and she gave off some memorable lines like "Seno akta gama" or "Multi-pass" or "Big bada boom." Gary Oldman gave a very good performance as the villain but I didn't like the way he was killed in the end. But the only character that I really didn't like was Chris Tucker's performance as Ruby Rhoad. He was probably put in for comedy but he was very annoying and very unfunny and his character felt pretty unnecessary. But the special effects and action scenes are well done. I'm surprised I never heard of this movie until I saw it just a couple of years ago. I'm sure it was a hit when it first came out in 1997 but it deserves more credit and should be appreciated and mentioned more. I would've even liked to have seen a sequel of it too but that doesn't seem likely, unfortunately. But The Fifth Element is an overall 8/10.

    Did I say, "One of my all-time favourites?" Well, I meant it, "Was, Now & Ever Shall Be!" Anything more has already been said, other than we've got the 2-DVD Special Edition version & on the movie Disk 1, if you ever get bored rewatching The Fifth Element, choose the Fact Track menu option. Sweet! Not only does it add lots of actually interesting trivia to the film from Credits onwards, but it also forces a whole new level of attention span to what you think you've seen before. You just never know where or when the trivia text will appear on screen & so your eyes will reappraise peripheral viewpoints all over again. Fresh & new, yeah. Excellent... always.

    The Fifth Element directed by Luc Besson is a movie unlike others. The classic "save the world/universe" storyline, done right. Many things are incorporated into this movie to make it every genre you could imagine. Mostly classified as a Sci-Fi, some may also say it is a comedy, action, or love movie. Luc Besson has managed to incorporate nature into the future. Many people see the future as chrome. This movie sees it as a ghetto, dirty place where greenery no longer flourishes. Fast food chains and major corporations rule, with practically no trees or natural monuments. A classic, one man, Korben Dallas, must save the future world from a certain doom and find love at the same time. The Fifth Element is a beautiful movie because of its unique presentation of a very common plot. Every save the world/universe movie we know ends and starts the same. A man or woman who is no longer part of any military or government-based program is chosen to save the world. They do not want to do it but they are the "only ones" on the earth who can do it. Of course, The Fifth Element takes this concept and uses it, but in a beautiful, never done before way. This movie uses the future with flying cars, unbelievable skyscrapers, space ships, and alien life, and shows a different take on it. These buildings, cars, and even people in major cities and not glamorous and glorified. They are worn-out, run down, and crummy. This is a more realistic interpretation of the future because of the way we are spiraling down. In this movie, Bruce Willis plays a man Korben Dallas, a simple city cab driver and ex-military man, who of course, must save the universe from a certain fatal death. He must go on a cruise ship to find these four "element stones" and use them with "the fifth element" to save the world from certain death. The antagonist, Zorg, and the protagonist, Korben, are all trying to find the stones to use them for good or to use them for evil. Korben, as well as Zorg, are one of many characters that you find make this movie what it is. Not only is the plot phenomenal, but the characters and their development with the plot as well. The characters in this movie are ones who form the plot to be what it is. I know it's the same in every movie, but for this one practically everyone plays a part. Leeloo, the love interest, is the supreme human being, or in other words, perfect. In this movie, she is first an alien of what is believed to be the divine race, and what is found of her remains becomes reconstructed in a laboratory where when she becomes "human" or looks to us what would be "normal", you find that she has bright orange hair, a thin figure, and a face with no-make up. Most people would find this unattractive, which is another reason I find this movie so beautiful. It shows true beauty in almost everything. There is another character named Ruby Rhod, who Korben is pretty much partnered up with after "winning" the contest hosted by Ruby to win the cruise tickets. Ruby is a radio show host, very popular; whom many would say is metrosexual. He cares very much about his looks and that his show goes well. I would like to think of Ruby as the comedy figure in this film. Other characters such as the priest, his assistant, and even the president all make this movie what it is and all tie it in together. Cornelius, the priest, and his assistant both play a huge role by telling the story of how the evil came to be. Zorg, who is the antagonist of the story, plays a beautiful part. His unique look and superb acting skills help this movie form. From the very beginning of the movie, he plays a very important role of telling what is going on, what he is doing, and how he's going to do it. There are so many beautiful things about this movie, from the actors and their characters, to the graphics and plot. This movie is a must see for everyone because of its wonderful rendition on a common and almost boring plot. In my opinion this movie is going to be a forever sci-fi, action classic. The Fifth Element has a great rendition on a common plot that made it what it is, which is, a beautiful movie.

It's funny, it's exciting, it's goofy, it's over- the-top, it's campy (in a good way), it's sexy (i.e. Lee-Loo), it's romantic, it's action-packed. It's like one of those rare kind of sci-fi movie you hardly see nowadays. Bruce Willis is doing his thing as Korben Dallas, being the hero who saves the day and gets into all the action. But he and Milla Jovovich had very good, romantic chemistry between them. Jovovich as Lee-Loo was both sexy and sublime and she gave off some memorable lines like "Seno akta gama" or "Multi-pass" or "Big bada boom." Gary Oldman gave a very good performance as the villain but I didn't like the way he was killed in the end. But the only character that I really didn't like was Chris Tucker's performance as Ruby Rhoad. He was probably put in for comedy but he was very annoying and very unfunny and his character felt pretty unnecessary. But the special effects and action scenes are well done. I'm surprised I never heard of this movie until I saw it just a couple of years ago. I'm sure it was a hit when it first came out in 1997 but it deserves more credit and should be appreciated and mentioned more. I would've even liked to have seen a sequel of it too but that doesn't seem likely, unfortunately. But The Fifth Element is an overall 8/10.

    Did I say, "One of my all-time favourites?" Well, I meant it, "Was, Now & Ever Shall Be!" Anything more has already been said, other than we've got the 2-DVD Special Edition version & on the movie Disk 1, if you ever get bored rewatching The Fifth Element, choose the Fact Track menu option. Sweet! Not only does it add lots of actually interesting trivia to the film from Credits onwards, but it also forces a whole new level of attention span to what you think you've seen before. You just never know where or when the trivia text will appear on screen & so your eyes will reappraise peripheral viewpoints all over again. Fresh & new, yeah. Excellent... always.

    The Fifth Element directed by Luc Besson is a movie unlike others. The classic "save the world/universe" storyline, done right. Many things are incorporated into this movie to make it every genre you could imagine. Mostly classified as a Sci-Fi, some may also say it is a comedy, action, or love movie. Luc Besson has managed to incorporate nature into the future. Many people see the future as chrome. This movie sees it as a ghetto, dirty place where greenery no longer flourishes. Fast food chains and major corporations rule, with practically no trees or natural monuments. A classic, one man, Korben Dallas, must save the future world from a certain doom and find love at the same time. The Fifth Element is a beautiful movie because of its unique presentation of a very common plot. Every save the world/universe movie we know ends and starts the same. A man or woman who is no longer part of any military or government-based program is chosen to save the world. They do not want to do it but they are the "only ones" on the earth who can do it. Of course, The Fifth Element takes this concept and uses it, but in a beautiful, never done before way. This movie uses the future with flying cars, unbelievable skyscrapers, space ships, and alien life, and shows a different take on it. These buildings, cars, and even people in major cities and not glamorous and glorified. They are worn-out, run down, and crummy. This is a more realistic interpretation of the future because of the way we are spiraling down. In this movie, Bruce Willis plays a man Korben Dallas, a simple city cab driver and ex-military man, who of course, must save the universe from a certain fatal death. He must go on a cruise ship to find these four "element stones" and use them with "the fifth element" to save the world from certain death. The antagonist, Zorg, and the protagonist, Korben, are all trying to find the stones to use them for good or to use them for evil. Korben, as well as Zorg, are one of many characters that you find make this movie what it is. Not only is the plot phenomenal, but the characters and their development with the plot as well. The characters in this movie are ones who form the plot to be what it is. I know it's the same in every movie, but for this one practically everyone plays a part. Leeloo, the love interest, is the supreme human being, or in other words, perfect. In this movie, she is first an alien of what is believed to be the divine race, and what is found of her remains becomes reconstructed in a laboratory where when she becomes "human" or looks to us what would be "normal", you find that she has bright orange hair, a thin figure, and a face with no-make up. Most people would find this unattractive, which is another reason I find this movie so beautiful. It shows true beauty in almost everything. There is another character named Ruby Rhod, who Korben is pretty much partnered up with after "winning" the contest hosted by Ruby to win the cruise tickets. Ruby is a radio show host, very popular; whom many would say is metrosexual. He cares very much about his looks and that his show goes well. I would like to think of Ruby as the comedy figure in this film. Other characters such as the priest, his assistant, and even the president all make this movie what it is and all tie it in together. Cornelius, the priest, and his assistant both play a huge role by telling the story of how the evil came to be. Zorg, who is the antagonist of the story, plays a beautiful part. His unique look and superb acting skills help this movie form. From the very beginning of the movie, he plays a very important role of telling what is going on, what he is doing, and how he's going to do it. There are so many beautiful things about this movie, from the actors and their characters, to the graphics and plot. This movie is a must see for everyone because of its wonderful rendition on a common and almost boring plot. In my opinion this movie is going to be a forever sci-fi, action classic. The Fifth Element has a great rendition on a common plot that made it what it is, which is, a beautiful movie.

    I was intrigued to watch this movie, checked the IMDb score beforehand and was looking forward to a good Bruce Willis sci-fi. Unfortunately, what i got was a passable opening ~40 minutes which dissolved into complete utter stupidity soon as Chris Tucker appeared on the scene. I could not believe the direction thought giving his character such a large role was a good idea. He takes over the movie and craps all over it. I hoped he would have a five minute side role, but no, he becomes a main character, given even more screen time than the interesting and attractive leeloo, and Bruce Willis. He is not funny, just fecking stupid and i wanted to shoot him and if i am honest i still do. How anyone can find this kind of humour funny is completely beyond me. Do you like screaming obnoxious loud uneducated black women that never shut their effing mouth? No? So why is it "funny", when a man portrays the same character? It isn't. If you are an intelligent person, don't listen to the majority score, the majority of people have 90IQ. For you, dignified human being, this movie is offensive in its stupidity.

    This is a great example why I dislike most of today's movies. Movies back then (80 ~ 90 and some of 00's) where more courageous, directors weren't afraid of craziness and nonsense. More art could be expressed, more challenging scenes! I miss this! This movie shows this things clearly, actors are very into this whole new universe and the universe itself is well developed. As a Isaac Asimov reader I approve this science fiction. Now lets talk specifics... I always write for you guys to help choosing this movie to watch, so this is why and when I think you should get this one: If you are into Sci-Fi get this movie, no matter what. It has some plot issues like things happening too fast and some weak comedy in scenes that don't need or match the requirements... but still this is a great Sci-Fi. You'll be able to enjoy even the lifestyle of the universe, the clothes, the environment, the mores. Just do it. As for any other, you should watch to experience a movie that doesn't work on the character development or on the people interactions but it develops an entire new universe so you can enjoy thinking of it. It may be your intro to Sci-Fi since it is a light Sci-Fi with easy to understand rules. Finally for the bads... This movie has some problems. Some times the scenes go too fast and it is somewhat hard to understand why somethings are to be that way. The movie doesn't end well too because of that, for some reason in the end near the climax, things start to solve really fast for idiotic reasons. That doesn't ruin the movie but instead shows how much potential it have if those were to be fixed. It deserves the 7 it has.

    The Fifth Element is a light hearted Sci-Fi adventure featuring Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. Directed by Luc Besson, it takes us through a story that blends faith, comedy and lots of things blowing up. The plot is simple: evil has been kept at bay by a mysterious priesthood for centuries. Now, that evil force has returned and the world must be protected. Evil, however, has other plans; with the greedy interference of a self-centred entrepreneur (played by Gary Oldman), Evil manages to all but destroy humanities only hope. In response, humanity sends in retired soldier Bruce Willis. The rest of the movie involves Bruce seeking out the Five Elements that will destroy evil and the assorted troubles and misadventures that result. Moving quickly, cleverly and with brilliant cohesion under Besson's capable direction, The Fifth Element is a great and vastly underrated film. With great visuals, excellent special effects and some very clever editing, it's a film well worth watching.

    I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but after watching "Leon" (and loved it) I wanted to see other Luc Besson projects. Well, it rarely happens, but this film exceeded my expectations! "The Fifth Element" was really amusing. The action scenes were not monumental, but they were fine. The performances of the actors were also delightful. The colourful setting and costumes (designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier) added a lot to the film, making it one of the most surprising and smart films I've seen for a while. Perhaps the film lacks a little suspense. I'd like to see some more of Oldman, too. I have not seen as many science fiction as I'd wish to, but I can understand why this movie polarized the critics. Nevertheless, I certainly recommend it to the fans of the genre.

    WOW! Stunningly visual and mind-blowing action! If you love science fiction, action, adventure, or just imagine what kind of cool stuff the future may hold for humankind - this is a must-see film. Much like the world of Blade Runner in the way the world looks and feels in the distant future - everything you could possibly love about science fiction, action, adventure, comedy, and even romance is right here! From the moment the movie begins, you know that you are going to be in for something magical and wonderful. I grew up reading Heavy Metal Magazine and enjoyed the animated motion picture as well. This movie brought together all of the incredible art and magic of those artist into a live action film with great acting and a brilliant story. Thank you, Luc Besson (and the artists that helped you) - you have created a brilliant work of art!

    *Possible spoilers ahead* Fear not for the future, folks, 'cause (get this!) in the 23rd Century a real bad-ass, cab-driving mama's boy is gonna kick some serious alien butt and save all of mankind from total annihilation. So, for the time being, you can all be rest assured that, thanks to Korben Dallas, we are safe from Alien Armageddon once again. Phew! That was a close one, though! Eh? Now, I wouldn't exactly say that The Fifth Element was the worst Sci-Fi movie ever made. No, I wouldn't say that. But I would say that it was most certainly one of the most unhinged, most sloppy and badly-paced of that particular genre which I've ever seen. Would I say that The Fifth Element was so bad that it was almost (but not quite) good? Yeah. Well, maybe I would. When it was revealed to me where the 4 Mystical Stones were being hidden I almost choked, as the Diva Plavalaguana must've when she snarfed them down for safe keeping. (Well, how else could she have gotten them inside her guts? - Unless she had shoved 'em up her big, blue keester) (snicker-snicker) I have to admit that it wasn't Willis's "Dallas" character who bugged me the most in this movie. There were actually 2 other contenders for the most despicable character who beat out Dallas by a long-shot. #1 was Gary Oldman's Zorg. Let's face it, Oldman just can't convincingly play a villain worth crap. Watching this snivelling wimp trying so desperately to appear evil was the same thing as if the part of Zorg had been given to PeeWee Herman. #2 most despicable character was (surprise-surprise) Ruby Rhod. OK. I'll admit that for the first time around this heterosexual-transvestite's schtick was actually kinda amusing. But when he returned for a 2nd performance he fell flat on his face with all of that fast-talking nonsense. Had the Ruby Rhod character been instrumental in helping Dallas save the day, then, yes, I would've easily forgiven his annoying presence. But all he turned out to be was a big, stupid suck who proved to be a deterrent to Dallas's gallant heroics. Thank goodness that director Luc Besson flatly refused to make a sequel to this disappointing film. And speaking about Besson, here's a little behind-the-scenes drama that might be of interest to some of you here at IMDb - Up to the beginning of The Fifth Element's production, Besson was a married man (of 6 years) to actress Maiwenn Le Besco, who played the "Diva" character. (She was also 16 years his junior). Once filming got underway Besson didn't waste any time to dump Le Besco like a hot potato and start bedding Milla Jovovich, whom he quickly married. (This blissful union of wedlock lasted for exactly 2 whole years. My-oh-my, isn't love just grand?) Like, can you just imagine all of the frickin' tension and ill-will that must've been going one during the production of this film with Besson's bed-hopping and these 2 women vying for his attention? Wow! That must've been a circus, and a half! P.S. - Oh, yeah. Another thing that lost this film points was its blatant product placement of the familiar McDonalds trademark shoved into my face.... Uh.... Do you really believe that this horrible fast-food franchise will still be around in the 23rd Century? I certainly hope not!

    The Fifth Element a sci-fi action extravaganza by Luc Besson. The good. Funny. Outrageous settings and costumes. Wildly imaginative technology and prognostics for the future. Lots of action. The actors. Bruce Willis is in his middle phase. Not his best performance, but still pretty good. Gary Oldman is right as the evil Zorg, the trash of humanity. Ian Holm give us a great performance as the overwhelmed and slightly klutzy priest. Milla Jovovich's role doesn't require much of her, but she's simply adorable. And finally, Chris Tucker is fantastic as the extremely annoying radio DJ. It takes a few times seeing the flick to get used to him, but he's just perfect. The bad. The story is your basic save the world concept, with the ultimate evil, the criminals helping out, and the good guys, which include the army. Nothing inventive there. The ugly. The pet is too obviously a puppet. The result. Lots of sci-fi fun.

    WOW! Stunningly visual and mind-blowing action! If you love science fiction, action, adventure, or just imagine what kind of cool stuff the future may hold for humankind - this is a must-see film. Much like the world of Blade Runner in the way the world looks and feels in the distant future - everything you could possibly love about science fiction, action, adventure, comedy, and even romance is right here! From the moment the movie begins, you know that you are going to be in for something magical and wonderful. I grew up reading Heavy Metal Magazine and enjoyed the animated motion picture as well. This movie brought together all of the incredible art and magic of those artist into a live action film with great acting and a brilliant story. Thank you, Luc Besson (and the artists that helped you) - you have created a brilliant work of art!

    *Possible spoilers ahead* Fear not for the future, folks, 'cause (get this!) in the 23rd Century a real bad-ass, cab-driving mama's boy is gonna kick some serious alien butt and save all of mankind from total annihilation. So, for the time being, you can all be rest assured that, thanks to Korben Dallas, we are safe from Alien Armageddon once again. Phew! That was a close one, though! Eh? Now, I wouldn't exactly say that The Fifth Element was the worst Sci-Fi movie ever made. No, I wouldn't say that. But I would say that it was most certainly one of the most unhinged, most sloppy and badly-paced of that particular genre which I've ever seen. Would I say that The Fifth Element was so bad that it was almost (but not quite) good? Yeah. Well, maybe I would. When it was revealed to me where the 4 Mystical Stones were being hidden I almost choked, as the Diva Plavalaguana must've when she snarfed them down for safe keeping. (Well, how else could she have gotten them inside her guts? - Unless she had shoved 'em up her big, blue keester) (snicker-snicker) I have to admit that it wasn't Willis's "Dallas" character who bugged me the most in this movie. There were actually 2 other contenders for the most despicable character who beat out Dallas by a long-shot. #1 was Gary Oldman's Zorg. Let's face it, Oldman just can't convincingly play a villain worth crap. Watching this snivelling wimp trying so desperately to appear evil was the same thing as if the part of Zorg had been given to PeeWee Herman. #2 most despicable character was (surprise-surprise) Ruby Rhod. OK. I'll admit that for the first time around this heterosexual-transvestite's schtick was actually kinda amusing. But when he returned for a 2nd performance he fell flat on his face with all of that fast-talking nonsense. Had the Ruby Rhod character been instrumental in helping Dallas save the day, then, yes, I would've easily forgiven his annoying presence. But all he turned out to be was a big, stupid suck who proved to be a deterrent to Dallas's gallant heroics. Thank goodness that director Luc Besson flatly refused to make a sequel to this disappointing film. And speaking about Besson, here's a little behind-the-scenes drama that might be of interest to some of you here at IMDb - Up to the beginning of The Fifth Element's production, Besson was a married man (of 6 years) to actress Maiwenn Le Besco, who played the "Diva" character. (She was also 16 years his junior). Once filming got underway Besson didn't waste any time to dump Le Besco like a hot potato and start bedding Milla Jovovich, whom he quickly married. (This blissful union of wedlock lasted for exactly 2 whole years. My-oh-my, isn't love just grand?) Like, can you just imagine all of the frickin' tension and ill-will that must've been going one during the production of this film with Besson's bed-hopping and these 2 women vying for his attention? Wow! That must've been a circus, and a half! P.S. - Oh, yeah. Another thing that lost this film points was its blatant product placement of the familiar McDonalds trademark shoved into my face.... Uh.... Do you really believe that this horrible fast-food franchise will still be around in the 23rd Century? I certainly hope not!

    The Fifth Element a sci-fi action extravaganza by Luc Besson. The good. Funny. Outrageous settings and costumes. Wildly imaginative technology and prognostics for the future. Lots of action. The actors. Bruce Willis is in his middle phase. Not his best performance, but still pretty good. Gary Oldman is right as the evil Zorg, the trash of humanity. Ian Holm give us a great performance as the overwhelmed and slightly klutzy priest. Milla Jovovich's role doesn't require much of her, but she's simply adorable. And finally, Chris Tucker is fantastic as the extremely annoying radio DJ. It takes a few times seeing the flick to get used to him, but he's just perfect. The bad. The story is your basic save the world concept, with the ultimate evil, the criminals helping out, and the good guys, which include the army. Nothing inventive there. The ugly. The pet is too obviously a puppet. The result. Lots of sci-fi fun.

    What I really like about The Fifth Element is that it has a little bit of everything in it. It's funny, it's exciting, it's goofy, it's over- the-top, it's campy (in a good way), it's sexy (i.e. Lee-Loo), it's romantic, it's action-packed. It's like one of those rare kind of sci-fi movie you hardly see nowadays. Bruce Willis is doing his thing as Korben Dallas, being the hero who saves the day and gets into all the action. But he and Milla Jovovich had very good, romantic chemistry between them. Jovovich as Lee-Loo was both sexy and sublime and she gave off some memorable lines like "Seno akta gama" or "Multi-pass" or "Big bada boom." Gary Oldman gave a very good performance as the villain but I didn't like the way he was killed in the end. But the only character that I really didn't like was Chris Tucker's performance as Ruby Rhoad. He was probably put in for comedy but he was very annoying and very unfunny and his character felt pretty unnecessary. But the special effects and action scenes are well done. I'm surprised I never heard of this movie until I saw it just a couple of years ago. I'm sure it was a hit when it first came out in 1997 but it deserves more credit and should be appreciated and mentioned more. I would've even liked to have seen a sequel of it too but that doesn't seem likely, unfortunately. But The Fifth Element is an overall 8/10.

Anything more has already been said, other than we've got the 2-DVD Special Edition version & on the movie Disk 1, if you ever get bored rewatching The Fifth Element, choose the Fact Track menu option. Sweet! Not only does it add lots of actually interesting trivia to the film from Credits onwards, but it also forces a whole new level of attention span to what you think you've seen before. You just never know where or when the trivia text will appear on screen & so your eyes will reappraise peripheral viewpoints all over again. Fresh & new, yeah. Excellent... always.

    The Fifth Element directed by Luc Besson is a movie unlike others. The classic "save the world/universe" storyline, done right. Many things are incorporated into this movie to make it every genre you could imagine. Mostly classified as a Sci-Fi, some may also say it is a comedy, action, or love movie. Luc Besson has managed to incorporate nature into the future. Many people see the future as chrome. This movie sees it as a ghetto, dirty place where greenery no longer flourishes. Fast food chains and major corporations rule, with practically no trees or natural monuments. A classic, one man, Korben Dallas, must save the future world from a certain doom and find love at the same time. The Fifth Element is a beautiful movie because of its unique presentation of a very common plot. Every save the world/universe movie we know ends and starts the same. A man or woman who is no longer part of any military or government-based program is chosen to save the world. They do not want to do it but they are the "only ones" on the earth who can do it. Of course, The Fifth Element takes this concept and uses it, but in a beautiful, never done before way. This movie uses the future with flying cars, unbelievable skyscrapers, space ships, and alien life, and shows a different take on it. These buildings, cars, and even people in major cities and not glamorous and glorified. They are worn-out, run down, and crummy. This is a more realistic interpretation of the future because of the way we are spiraling down. In this movie, Bruce Willis plays a man Korben Dallas, a simple city cab driver and ex-military man, who of course, must save the universe from a certain fatal death. He must go on a cruise ship to find these four "element stones" and use them with "the fifth element" to save the world from certain death. The antagonist, Zorg, and the protagonist, Korben, are all trying to find the stones to use them for good or to use them for evil. Korben, as well as Zorg, are one of many characters that you find make this movie what it is. Not only is the plot phenomenal, but the characters and their development with the plot as well. The characters in this movie are ones who form the plot to be what it is. I know it's the same in every movie, but for this one practically everyone plays a part. Leeloo, the love interest, is the supreme human being, or in other words, perfect. In this movie, she is first an alien of what is believed to be the divine race, and what is found of her remains becomes reconstructed in a laboratory where when she becomes "human" or looks to us what would be "normal", you find that she has bright orange hair, a thin figure, and a face with no-make up. Most people would find this unattractive, which is another reason I find this movie so beautiful. It shows true beauty in almost everything. There is another character named Ruby Rhod, who Korben is pretty much partnered up with after "winning" the contest hosted by Ruby to win the cruise tickets. Ruby is a radio show host, very popular; whom many would say is metrosexual. He cares very much about his looks and that his show goes well. I would like to think of Ruby as the comedy figure in this film. Other characters such as the priest, his assistant, and even the president all make this movie what it is and all tie it in together. Cornelius, the priest, and his assistant both play a huge role by telling the story of how the evil came to be. Zorg, who is the antagonist of the story, plays a beautiful part. His unique look and superb acting skills help this movie form. From the very beginning of the movie, he plays a very important role of telling what is going on, what he is doing, and how he's going to do it. There are so many beautiful things about this movie, from the actors and their characters, to the graphics and plot. This movie is a must see for everyone because of its wonderful rendition on a common and almost boring plot. In my opinion this movie is going to be a forever sci-fi, action classic. The Fifth Element has a great rendition on a common plot that made it what it is, which is, a beautiful movie.

    I was intrigued to watch this movie, checked the IMDb score beforehand and was looking forward to a good Bruce Willis sci-fi. Unfortunately, what i got was a passable opening ~40 minutes which dissolved into complete utter stupidity soon as Chris Tucker appeared on the scene. I could not believe the direction thought giving his character such a large role was a good idea. He takes over the movie and craps all over it. I hoped he would have a five minute side role, but no, he becomes a main character, given even more screen time than the interesting and attractive leeloo, and Bruce Willis. He is not funny, just fecking stupid and i wanted to shoot him and if i am honest i still do. How anyone can find this kind of humour funny is completely beyond me. Do you like screaming obnoxious loud uneducated black women that never shut their effing mouth? No? So why is it "funny", when a man portrays the same character? It isn't. If you are an intelligent person, don't listen to the majority score, the majority of people have 90IQ. For you, dignified human being, this movie is offensive in its stupidity.

    This is a great example why I dislike most of today's movies. Movies back then (80 ~ 90 and some of 00's) where more courageous, directors weren't afraid of craziness and nonsense. More art could be expressed, more challenging scenes! I miss this! This movie shows this things clearly, actors are very into this whole new universe and the universe itself is well developed. As a Isaac Asimov reader I approve this science fiction. Now lets talk specifics... I always write for you guys to help choosing this movie to watch, so this is why and when I think you should get this one: If you are into Sci-Fi get this movie, no matter what. It has some plot issues like things happening too fast and some weak comedy in scenes that don't need or match the requirements... but still this is a great Sci-Fi. You'll be able to enjoy even the lifestyle of the universe, the clothes, the environment, the mores. Just do it. As for any other, you should watch to experience a movie that doesn't work on the character development or on the people interactions but it develops an entire new universe so you can enjoy thinking of it. It may be your intro to Sci-Fi since it is a light Sci-Fi with easy to understand rules. Finally for the bads... This movie has some problems. Some times the scenes go too fast and it is somewhat hard to understand why somethings are to be that way. The movie doesn't end well too because of that, for some reason in the end near the climax, things start to solve really fast for idiotic reasons. That doesn't ruin the movie but instead shows how much potential it have if those were to be fixed. It deserves the 7 it has.

    The Fifth Element is a light hearted Sci-Fi adventure featuring Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. Directed by Luc Besson, it takes us through a story that blends faith, comedy and lots of things blowing up. The plot is simple: evil has been kept at bay by a mysterious priesthood for centuries. Now, that evil force has returned and the world must be protected. Evil, however, has other plans; with the greedy interference of a self-centred entrepreneur (played by Gary Oldman), Evil manages to all but destroy humanities only hope. In response, humanity sends in retired soldier Bruce Willis. The rest of the movie involves Bruce seeking out the Five Elements that will destroy evil and the assorted troubles and misadventures that result. Moving quickly, cleverly and with brilliant cohesion under Besson's capable direction, The Fifth Element is a great and vastly underrated film. With great visuals, excellent special effects and some very clever editing, it's a film well worth watching.

    I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but after watching "Leon" (and loved it) I wanted to see other Luc Besson projects. Well, it rarely happens, but this film exceeded my expectations! "The Fifth Element" was really amusing. The action scenes were not monumental, but they were fine. The performances of the actors were also delightful. The colourful setting and costumes (designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier) added a lot to the film, making it one of the most surprising and smart films I've seen for a while. Perhaps the film lacks a little suspense. I'd like to see some more of Oldman, too. I have not seen as many science fiction as I'd wish to, but I can understand why this movie polarized the critics. Nevertheless, I certainly recommend it to the fans of the genre.

    I was intrigued to watch this movie, checked the IMDb score beforehand and was looking forward to a good Bruce Willis sci-fi. Unfortunately, what i got was a passable opening ~40 minutes which dissolved into complete utter stupidity soon as Chris Tucker appeared on the scene. I could not believe the direction thought giving his character such a large role was a good idea. He takes over the movie and craps all over it. I hoped he would have a five minute side role, but no, he becomes a main character, given even more screen time than the interesting and attractive leeloo, and Bruce Willis. He is not funny, just fecking stupid and i wanted to shoot him and if i am honest i still do. How anyone can find this kind of humour funny is completely beyond me. Do you like screaming obnoxious loud uneducated black women that never shut their effing mouth? No? So why is it "funny", when a man portrays the same character? It isn't. If you are an intelligent person, don't listen to the majority score, the majority of people have 90IQ. For you, dignified human being, this movie is offensive in its stupidity.

    This is a great example why I dislike most of today's movies. Movies back then (80 ~ 90 and some of 00's) where more courageous, directors weren't afraid of craziness and nonsense. More art could be expressed, more challenging scenes! I miss this! This movie shows this things clearly, actors are very into this whole new universe and the universe itself is well developed. As a Isaac Asimov reader I approve this science fiction. Now lets talk specifics... I always write for you guys to help choosing this movie to watch, so this is why and when I think you should get this one: If you are into Sci-Fi get this movie, no matter what. It has some plot issues like things happening too fast and some weak comedy in scenes that don't need or match the requirements... but still this is a great Sci-Fi. You'll be able to enjoy even the lifestyle of the universe, the clothes, the environment, the mores. Just do it. As for any other, you should watch to experience a movie that doesn't work on the character development or on the people interactions but it develops an entire new universe so you can enjoy thinking of it. It may be your intro to Sci-Fi since it is a light Sci-Fi with easy to understand rules. Finally for the bads... This movie has some problems. Some times the scenes go too fast and it is somewhat hard to understand why somethings are to be that way. The movie doesn't end well too because of that, for some reason in the end near the climax, things start to solve really fast for idiotic reasons. That doesn't ruin the movie but instead shows how much potential it have if those were to be fixed. It deserves the 7 it has.

    The Fifth Element is a light hearted Sci-Fi adventure featuring Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. Directed by Luc Besson, it takes us through a story that blends faith, comedy and lots of things blowing up. The plot is simple: evil has been kept at bay by a mysterious priesthood for centuries. Now, that evil force has returned and the world must be protected. Evil, however, has other plans; with the greedy interference of a self-centred entrepreneur (played by Gary Oldman), Evil manages to all but destroy humanities only hope. In response, humanity sends in retired soldier Bruce Willis. The rest of the movie involves Bruce seeking out the Five Elements that will destroy evil and the assorted troubles and misadventures that result. Moving quickly, cleverly and with brilliant cohesion under Besson's capable direction, The Fifth Element is a great and vastly underrated film. With great visuals, excellent special effects and some very clever editing, it's a film well worth watching.

    I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but after watching "Leon" (and loved it) I wanted to see other Luc Besson projects. Well, it rarely happens, but this film exceeded my expectations! "The Fifth Element" was really amusing. The action scenes were not monumental, but they were fine. The performances of the actors were also delightful. The colourful setting and costumes (designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier) added a lot to the film, making it one of the most surprising and smart films I've seen for a while. Perhaps the film lacks a little suspense. I'd like to see some more of Oldman, too. I have not seen as many science fiction as I'd wish to, but I can understand why this movie polarized the critics. Nevertheless, I certainly recommend it to the fans of the genre.

    WOW! Stunningly visual and mind-blowing action! If you love science fiction, action, adventure, or just imagine what kind of cool stuff the future may hold for humankind - this is a must-see film. Much like the world of Blade Runner in the way the world looks and feels in the distant future - everything you could possibly love about science fiction, action, adventure, comedy, and even romance is right here! From the moment the movie begins, you know that you are going to be in for something magical and wonderful. I grew up reading Heavy Metal Magazine and enjoyed the animated motion picture as well. This movie brought together all of the incredible art and magic of those artist into a live action film with great acting and a brilliant story. Thank you, Luc Besson (and the artists that helped you) - you have created a brilliant work of art!

    *Possible spoilers ahead* Fear not for the future, folks, 'cause (get this!) in the 23rd Century a real bad-ass, cab-driving mama's boy is gonna kick some serious alien butt and save all of mankind from total annihilation. So, for the time being, you can all be rest assured that, thanks to Korben Dallas, we are safe from Alien Armageddon once again. Phew! That was a close one, though! Eh? Now, I wouldn't exactly say that The Fifth Element was the worst Sci-Fi movie ever made. No, I wouldn't say that. But I would say that it was most certainly one of the most unhinged, most sloppy and badly-paced of that particular genre which I've ever seen. Would I say that The Fifth Element was so bad that it was almost (but not quite) good? Yeah. Well, maybe I would. When it was revealed to me where the 4 Mystical Stones were being hidden I almost choked, as the Diva Plavalaguana must've when she snarfed them down for safe keeping. (Well, how else could she have gotten them inside her guts? - Unless she had shoved 'em up her big, blue keester) (snicker-snicker) I have to admit that it wasn't Willis's "Dallas" character who bugged me the most in this movie. There were actually 2 other contenders for the most despicable character who beat out Dallas by a long-shot. #1 was Gary Oldman's Zorg. Let's face it, Oldman just can't convincingly play a villain worth crap. Watching this snivelling wimp trying so desperately to appear evil was the same thing as if the part of Zorg had been given to PeeWee Herman. #2 most despicable character was (surprise-surprise) Ruby Rhod. OK. I'll admit that for the first time around this heterosexual-transvestite's schtick was actually kinda amusing. But when he returned for a 2nd performance he fell flat on his face with all of that fast-talking nonsense. Had the Ruby Rhod character been instrumental in helping Dallas save the day, then, yes, I would've easily forgiven his annoying presence. But all he turned out to be was a big, stupid suck who proved to be a deterrent to Dallas's gallant heroics. Thank goodness that director Luc Besson flatly refused to make a sequel to this disappointing film. And speaking about Besson, here's a little behind-the-scenes drama that might be of interest to some of you here at IMDb - Up to the beginning of The Fifth Element's production, Besson was a married man (of 6 years) to actress Maiwenn Le Besco, who played the "Diva" character. (She was also 16 years his junior). Once filming got underway Besson didn't waste any time to dump Le Besco like a hot potato and start bedding Milla Jovovich, whom he quickly married. (This blissful union of wedlock lasted for exactly 2 whole years. My-oh-my, isn't love just grand?) Like, can you just imagine all of the frickin' tension and ill-will that must've been going one during the production of this film with Besson's bed-hopping and these 2 women vying for his attention? Wow! That must've been a circus, and a half! P.S. - Oh, yeah. Another thing that lost this film points was its blatant product placement of the familiar McDonalds trademark shoved into my face.... Uh.... Do you really believe that this horrible fast-food franchise will still be around in the 23rd Century? I certainly hope not!

    The Fifth Element a sci-fi action extravaganza by Luc Besson. The good. Funny. Outrageous settings and costumes. Wildly imaginative technology and prognostics for the future. Lots of action. The actors. Bruce Willis is in his middle phase. Not his best performance, but still pretty good. Gary Oldman is right as the evil Zorg, the trash of humanity. Ian Holm give us a great performance as the overwhelmed and slightly klutzy priest. Milla Jovovich's role doesn't require much of her, but she's simply adorable. And finally, Chris Tucker is fantastic as the extremely annoying radio DJ. It takes a few times seeing the flick to get used to him, but he's just perfect. The bad. The story is your basic save the world concept, with the ultimate evil, the criminals helping out, and the good guys, which include the army. Nothing inventive there. The ugly. The pet is too obviously a puppet. The result. Lots of sci-fi fun.

    What I really like about The Fifth Element is that it has a little bit of everything in it. It's funny, it's exciting, it's goofy, it's over- the-top, it's campy (in a good way), it's sexy (i.e. Lee-Loo), it's romantic, it's action-packed. It's like one of those rare kind of sci-fi movie you hardly see nowadays. Bruce Willis is doing his thing as Korben Dallas, being the hero who saves the day and gets into all the action. But he and Milla Jovovich had very good, romantic chemistry between them. Jovovich as Lee-Loo was both sexy and sublime and she gave off some memorable lines like "Seno akta gama" or "Multi-pass" or "Big bada boom." Gary Oldman gave a very good performance as the villain but I didn't like the way he was killed in the end. But the only character that I really didn't like was Chris Tucker's performance as Ruby Rhoad. He was probably put in for comedy but he was very annoying and very unfunny and his character felt pretty unnecessary. But the special effects and action scenes are well done. I'm surprised I never heard of this movie until I saw it just a couple of years ago. I'm sure it was a hit when it first came out in 1997 but it deserves more credit and should be appreciated and mentioned more. I would've even liked to have seen a sequel of it too but that doesn't seem likely, unfortunately. But The Fifth Element is an overall 8/10.

    Did I say, "One of my all-time favourites?" Well, I meant it, "Was, Now & Ever Shall Be!" Anything more has already been said, other than we've got the 2-DVD Special Edition version & on the movie Disk 1, if you ever get bored rewatching The Fifth Element, choose the Fact Track menu option. Sweet! Not only does it add lots of actually interesting trivia to the film from Credits onwards, but it also forces a whole new level of attention span to what you think you've seen before. You just never know where or when the trivia text will appear on screen & so your eyes will reappraise peripheral viewpoints all over again. Fresh & new, yeah. Excellent... always.

    The Fifth Element directed by Luc Besson is a movie unlike others. The classic "save the world/universe" storyline, done right. Many things are incorporated into this movie to make it every genre you could imagine. Mostly classified as a Sci-Fi, some may also say it is a comedy, action, or love movie. Luc Besson has managed to incorporate nature into the future. Many people see the future as chrome. This movie sees it as a ghetto, dirty place where greenery no longer flourishes. Fast food chains and major corporations rule, with practically no trees or natural monuments. A classic, one man, Korben Dallas, must save the future world from a certain doom and find love at the same time. The Fifth Element is a beautiful movie because of its unique presentation of a very common plot. Every save the world/universe movie we know ends and starts the same. A man or woman who is no longer part of any military or government-based program is chosen to save the world. They do not want to do it but they are the "only ones" on the earth who can do it. Of course, The Fifth Element takes this concept and uses it, but in a beautiful, never done before way. This movie uses the future with flying cars, unbelievable skyscrapers, space ships, and alien life, and shows a different take on it. These buildings, cars, and even people in major cities and not glamorous and glorified. They are worn-out, run down, and crummy. This is a more realistic interpretation of the future because of the way we are spiraling down. In this movie, Bruce Willis plays a man Korben Dallas, a simple city cab driver and ex-military man, who of course, must save the universe from a certain fatal death. He must go on a cruise ship to find these four "element stones" and use them with "the fifth element" to save the world from certain death. The antagonist, Zorg, and the protagonist, Korben, are all trying to find the stones to use them for good or to use them for evil. Korben, as well as Zorg, are one of many characters that you find make this movie what it is. Not only is the plot phenomenal, but the characters and their development with the plot as well. The characters in this movie are ones who form the plot to be what it is. I know it's the same in every movie, but for this one practically everyone plays a part. Leeloo, the love interest, is the supreme human being, or in other words, perfect. In this movie, she is first an alien of what is believed to be the divine race, and what is found of her remains becomes reconstructed in a laboratory where when she becomes "human" or looks to us what would be "normal", you find that she has bright orange hair, a thin figure, and a face with no-make up. Most people would find this unattractive, which is another reason I find this movie so beautiful. It shows true beauty in almost everything. There is another character named Ruby Rhod, who Korben is pretty much partnered up with after "winning" the contest hosted by Ruby to win the cruise tickets. Ruby is a radio show host, very popular; whom many would say is metrosexual. He cares very much about his looks and that his show goes well. I would like to think of Ruby as the comedy figure in this film. Other characters such as the priest, his assistant, and even the president all make this movie what it is and all tie it in together. Cornelius, the priest, and his assistant both play a huge role by telling the story of how the evil came to be. Zorg, who is the antagonist of the story, plays a beautiful part. His unique look and superb acting skills help this movie form. From the very beginning of the movie, he plays a very important role of telling what is going on, what he is doing, and how he's going to do it. There are so many beautiful things about this movie, from the actors and their characters, to the graphics and plot. This movie is a must see for everyone because of its wonderful rendition on a common and almost boring plot. In my opinion this movie is going to be a forever sci-fi, action classic. The Fifth Element has a great rendition on a common plot that made it what it is, which is, a beautiful movie.

Jovovich as Lee-Loo was both sexy and sublime and she gave off some memorable lines like "Seno akta gama" or "Multi-pass" or "Big bada boom." Gary Oldman gave a very good performance as the villain but I didn't like the way he was killed in the end. But the only character that I really didn't like was Chris Tucker's performance as Ruby Rhoad. He was probably put in for comedy but he was very annoying and very unfunny and his character felt pretty unnecessary. But the special effects and action scenes are well done. I'm surprised I never heard of this movie until I saw it just a couple of years ago. I'm sure it was a hit when it first came out in 1997 but it deserves more credit and should be appreciated and mentioned more. I would've even liked to have seen a sequel of it too but that doesn't seem likely, unfortunately. But The Fifth Element is an overall 8/10.

    Did I say, "One of my all-time favourites?" Well, I meant it, "Was, Now & Ever Shall Be!" Anything more has already been said, other than we've got the 2-DVD Special Edition version & on the movie Disk 1, if you ever get bored rewatching The Fifth Element, choose the Fact Track menu option. Sweet! Not only does it add lots of actually interesting trivia to the film from Credits onwards, but it also forces a whole new level of attention span to what you think you've seen before. You just never know where or when the trivia text will appear on screen & so your eyes will reappraise peripheral viewpoints all over again. Fresh & new, yeah. Excellent... always.
