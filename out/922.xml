 <sinopse>
  On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake encounters a strange North American man named Nobody who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Dead Man is the story of a young man's journey, both physically and spiritually, into very unfamiliar terrain. William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded, he encounters a very odd, outcast Native American, named "Nobody," who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story, with Nobody's help, leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature, circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw, a killer, and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away. Thrown into a world that is cruel and chaotic, his eyes are opened to the fragility that defines the realm of the living. It is as though he passes through the surface of a mirror, and emerges into a previously-unknown world that exists on the other side.

    William Blake, a young man from Ohio has lost his parents to illness, and heads West to begin anew. A long, surreal train ride across America is mildly disturbing to him, and the train's fireman lets Blake know that his destination - the town of "Machine" - is NO place to be. "The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body. The ball passes through her, and lodges near his heart. Blake fumbles with the woman's pistol, and manages to kill his attacker, which spells his doom. The Suitor was the son of the factory manager that rejected Blake, who then hires Bounty hunters to bring Blake in, dead or alive. Blake is now a hunted man, critically wounded, and sought by both the Law and hired killers. Blake narrowly escapes, with the unexpected aid of an Indian Shaman without a tribe, who calls himself "Nobody". What follows, is a surreal journey through the American West - Blake, assisted and sometimes harassed by Nobody, continues his journey to (he knows not where), with Nobody as guide and protector. Strange and malevolent encounters with men in the wilderness - all of them Desperadoes at some level - result in an increasing Body Count for Blake. Nobody is firmly convinced that Blake is the same William Blake as the English poet and author - Nobody tells Blake: "Now you are a killer of White Men. Your words will be written in blood". The strangeness of the encounters - the appearance of Benevolent Spirits to Blake in the camp's firelight - and an incredibly melancholy but sweet soundtrack (solo electric guitar, heavily Distorted with Reverb and Tremolo) by Neil Young - all contribute to an atmosphere of Foreboding. Is Blake already dead, and is this all a dream? This question begs the viewer to decide. I will not reveal any more of the story. I really hope that all the readers of these Reviews decide to see this movie for themselves. It is certainly Unique, and contains excellent acting by Gary Farmer, Lance Henrickson, and (darkly humorous) Billy Bob Thornton, to name just a few. Yes, it is a movie that reveals more, with successive viewings, than at first. Heavy use of Foreshadowing, and some Iconic displays (which may not be in harmony with the plot, but seem somehow appropriate anyway), also add to the feeling of Blake's journey. Of note, is the representation of the slaughter of Native Americans and their culture. The Death of their civilization is presented graphically, without words. Words are not necessary. Johnny Depp is, of course, brilliant in his role as William Blake - an innocent man, totally transformed and Metamorphosed into something else entirely.....but, IMHO, Gary Farmer is the most interesting Character in the movie. He is intelligent, articulate and actually well-educated in the White Man's ways, while still retaining some of the superstitious aspects of his Native culture. His character is the only really Humorous character in the story. He is kind-hearted and jovial by nature, but will kill without hesitation, if the need arises. I would grade this movie a "9" out of "10".

    I did not see the film Dead Man until after seeing Depp's film Lone Ranger. Wow, what a pair of films. Would make a great double bill. Dead Man is amazing. Really makes you think about near death experiences and what consciousness may be like in the dying process. Death may have occurred before the film even starts but the time of death doesn't matter. The point is not to get obsessed with exactly when he dies but to allow yourself to drift into an altered state of consciousness as Depp does. This is a major film achievement since actual death is something we can only imagine. I suspect film is one of the few ways we can get close to the experience while we are still alive. Jarmusch has done it with this film.

    Johnny Depp is one of the most talented & influential actors of the Modern-Era. His body of work proves that fact right! Having played some of the most twisted characters, Depp reinvents himself with his outstanding performance as a meek accountant in 'Dead Man'. WOW! 'Dead Man' Synopsis: On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake encounters a strange North American man named Nobody who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world. 'Dead Man', as a film, has the power to engross its viewer. Its an interesting film, that is executed sharply by Cult-Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch executes the film with style & a sense of wonderment, which works big time. The Narrative is crisp & even humorous at times. Jarmusch's Screenplay & Direction, both, are very well-done. Cinematography is fabulous. Editing is decent. Art Design is proper. Performance-Wise: Its a Johnny Depp Show All The Way! He's simply outstanding as the protagonist. This has to be Depp's finest performance from the mid 1990's. Gary Farmer is efficient. Crispin Glover & John Hurt are okay. Gabriel Byrne is ever-impressive. On the whole, 'Dead Man' is certainly a film worth watching.

    Dead Man is my 4th Jim Jarmusch film and it's a strange western that chronicles the death of a character played by Johnny Depp. This film is the very definition of a art-house western. It's weird, strange, shot in gorgeous black and white, stars a lot of actors you have seen before and it's weird. I enjoyed Dead Man quite a bit, but it din't resonate to me as much as Mystery Train or Ghost Dog did. The reason is very simple - Johnny Depp felt miscast in the role William Blake. Not saying he did a bad job, but he felt slightly off and out of place. As if he didn't belong in this film and that might the whole point of his character but it somehow disconnected me from the film. The rest of the film was excellent, featuring strange performances, bizarre scenes featuring well known character actors and so on. But by far the best thing in this film was Gary Farmer as Nobody. He played an interesting character and his performance was pure genius. I also liked the soundtrack done by Neil Young. I like his music and listening to him improvise the soundtrack is just amazing. So as far as the film goes, Dead Man is pretty good and interesting. I was hoping to be more drawn in by the lead performance but it didn't happen. Jarmusch should have cast Youki Kudoh in the lead or just about anyone who looks and feels out place, but has certain spark to their performance not just "I'm confused Johnny Depp Face".

    I am a big Bergman fan. Watching his slow filmed masterpieces I fall in love with magic of slow-paced filming. For shooting these scenes you must have knowledge like Ingmar, Tarkovsky, Kieslowsky... Jarmusch failed at all points... Johny Depp is the most overrated actor witch you can see in this movie and the many other ones-From Hell, Dark Shadows and many more. The plot is boring, and the black and white style is a big miss. With the spectrum of colors you can do anything, especially in movies like this one. I gave 5 to this movie only because I enjoyed Jarmusch's Ghost Dog, Night on Earth, Broken Flowers, Down by Law... Jarmusch's choice of Indian is desperate...I feel sorry for him, but this film is pure shit...5 out of 10.

    Those were the longest two hours I've ever experienced. And to top em off, I had an extra 30 minutes to go! Good God, what a drag this film is. This movie is nothing more than an overrated, pretentious pile of steaming camel excrement from the dreary, foul realms of Hell. The first quarter of this movie had me intrigued. There was a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere about it. But after that, it's just Johnny Depp and his racist Indian friend walking around in what-seems-to-be a forest (so much for a Western!) for the rest of the movie. The acting all around is so pathetic, especially by Depp. It almost seems as if he's barely even trying. It's just him wandering about speaking a few lines, then moving on. Of course, I'm not sure if he's to blame here, but overall, it's bad. The music is the WORST I've ever heard in a movie. EVER. It's just a distorted guitar motif on and off for the entire film - THE ENTIRE FILM! This movie being in black and white is nothing clever. Not like the pretentious hack Jim Jarmusch (director) would like to believe it is. It makes the entire film seem more uninspired and soulless. A useless strategy for a useless film. I can barely go on with this review like I could barely go on with the movie. Anyways, I'd like to point out that this is barely to be considered a Western film. If it is, then it gives the entire genre a bad name. The fact that I took time to write a review for this bloated piece of garbage is as generous as I could be. It's pretentious, boring, and an overall waste of time. If you watch this, then that'll be 120 minutes you will never retrieve. Avoid at all costs.

    A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Jarmusch's psychedelic Western that deals with existentialism and spirituality

    Dead Man presents the bizarre journey of a meek, naive young accountant who, after getting haplessly entangled in a deadly maelstrom, goes through an intellectual and spiritual transformation that changes his life forever. While any typical road movie could have served as an effective vehicle for the propagation of this quaint tale, Jarmusch defiantly opts to make a Western based on his belief that the Western as a genre is "very open to metaphor, and has deep roots in classical narrative forms." But, Dead Man is far from being a conventional Western. Jarmusch basically leverages upon flexibility of the form and its umbilical link to America to concoct a far more complex work of art that not only transcends genres, but also deals with existential and spiritual motifs. With Dead Man, Jarmusch succeeds in giving the Western genre his personal touch by ingeniously building upon the aforementioned complex motifs to formulate a powerful cinematic treatise enriched with several vital elements of poetry: be it metaphors, symbolism, allusion, or imagery. Depp's character in Dead Man is a namesake of the English poet William Blake. The association obviously is not limited to the name alone. Dead Man has multiple references to the poetry of William Blake. In fact, most of Exaybachay's recitations in the movie are taken from Blake's poems like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Auguries of Innocence, The Everlasting Gospel, etc. Anyone who has seen the movie would remember the bizarrely sublime (taken from the aforementioned Marriage): "The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn from the crow." Thel (beautifully played by Mili Avital), the name of the prostitute who sells paper flowers, is also a reference to William Blake's The Book of Thel. And to top it all, the all-knowing Exaybachay, an ardent William Blake admirer, believes the accountant Blake to be a reincarnation of the dead English poet. Overall, Dead Man is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that is bound to elicit extreme responses from its audience: one would either love it or detest it, no midway affair. The deftly blended humor and suspense gives the movie an eerie tone which plainly reflects the nauseating feeling, as experienced by movie's characters, of being stuck in a limbo. An existential Western with surrealistic overtones, the movie is equally brilliant on both the technical and emotional fronts. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that Dead Man serves to be a brilliant showcase of the very best in direction, cinematography, music and acting. Dead Man is not a film for a casual viewer. The patient viewer, however, would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie may require multiple viewings for a clearer and deeper understanding. Dead Man is a must watch for anyone who values intelligent cinema that goes beyond the usual doze of entertainment and makes the viewer ruminate on what he saw long after the movie is over.

    Interesting idea but unfortunately not fully realized. Refreshing black-and-white photography. Nice sardonic touches. Has its moments -- but not all moments equally good. Unfortunately, its undeniable small virtues were completely spoiled (for me) by the random, ear-splitting, badly improvised twanging and banging on some over-loud stringed device from hell. The movie could easily stand on its own feet without any music, and it certainly was not helped by this pointless racket. I somehow expected a more surreal and other-worldly ascent into sheer imagination at the end -- something that black-and-white would lend itself to, but found the ending a little bathetic.

    Dead man ( 1994 ) Johny Depp A black and white American classic for hardcore cinephiles .The central character molded on the 17th century English poet painter William Blake , on a spiritual journey . Beginning as an aspiring accountant forgetting his poetic past he begins his journey from the cut throat corrupt immoral metal mining bad town at faraway place close to the "Injun" land , learns what is cheating and treachery , quintessential to the real world capitalism .Being falsely accused of murder , hunted by the cannibal representative of uncle Sam eminently played by Lance Henrikssen ( who kills and eats the colored and Scottish origin co bounty hunters ) , helped by the Indian tribesman with ancient spiritual wisdom , who already had vision about the certain fate of death of Blake . The gun vending priest ( Alfred Molina as the trade post missionary ) all representing every modern day ills and evil of the Western society desperately trying to bring down the honest man Blake ( the 17th century poet was well known for his anti establishment stance after his demise ) . This fantastic classic of a movie needs repeat viewings to get a full grasp of the enormous and deep theme embedded within , reminded me of O'Brother .. where art thou ( 2000 , George Clooney ) another social satire masterpiece !!!

A long, surreal train ride across America is mildly disturbing to him, and the train's fireman lets Blake know that his destination - the town of "Machine" - is NO place to be. "The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body. The ball passes through her, and lodges near his heart. Blake fumbles with the woman's pistol, and manages to kill his attacker, which spells his doom.

    Dead Man presents the bizarre journey of a meek, naive young accountant who, after getting haplessly entangled in a deadly maelstrom, goes through an intellectual and spiritual transformation that changes his life forever. While any typical road movie could have served as an effective vehicle for the propagation of this quaint tale, Jarmusch defiantly opts to make a Western based on his belief that the Western as a genre is "very open to metaphor, and has deep roots in classical narrative forms." But, Dead Man is far from being a conventional Western. Jarmusch basically leverages upon flexibility of the form and its umbilical link to America to concoct a far more complex work of art that not only transcends genres, but also deals with existential and spiritual motifs. With Dead Man, Jarmusch succeeds in giving the Western genre his personal touch by ingeniously building upon the aforementioned complex motifs to formulate a powerful cinematic treatise enriched with several vital elements of poetry: be it metaphors, symbolism, allusion, or imagery. Depp's character in Dead Man is a namesake of the English poet William Blake. The association obviously is not limited to the name alone. Dead Man has multiple references to the poetry of William Blake. In fact, most of Exaybachay's recitations in the movie are taken from Blake's poems like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Auguries of Innocence, The Everlasting Gospel, etc. Anyone who has seen the movie would remember the bizarrely sublime (taken from the aforementioned Marriage): "The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn from the crow." Thel (beautifully played by Mili Avital), the name of the prostitute who sells paper flowers, is also a reference to William Blake's The Book of Thel. And to top it all, the all-knowing Exaybachay, an ardent William Blake admirer, believes the accountant Blake to be a reincarnation of the dead English poet. Overall, Dead Man is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that is bound to elicit extreme responses from its audience: one would either love it or detest it, no midway affair. The deftly blended humor and suspense gives the movie an eerie tone which plainly reflects the nauseating feeling, as experienced by movie's characters, of being stuck in a limbo. An existential Western with surrealistic overtones, the movie is equally brilliant on both the technical and emotional fronts. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that Dead Man serves to be a brilliant showcase of the very best in direction, cinematography, music and acting. Dead Man is not a film for a casual viewer. The patient viewer, however, would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie may require multiple viewings for a clearer and deeper understanding. Dead Man is a must watch for anyone who values intelligent cinema that goes beyond the usual doze of entertainment and makes the viewer ruminate on what he saw long after the movie is over.

    Interesting idea but unfortunately not fully realized. Refreshing black-and-white photography. Nice sardonic touches. Has its moments -- but not all moments equally good. Unfortunately, its undeniable small virtues were completely spoiled (for me) by the random, ear-splitting, badly improvised twanging and banging on some over-loud stringed device from hell. The movie could easily stand on its own feet without any music, and it certainly was not helped by this pointless racket. I somehow expected a more surreal and other-worldly ascent into sheer imagination at the end -- something that black-and-white would lend itself to, but found the ending a little bathetic.

    William Blake, a young man from Ohio has lost his parents to illness, and heads West to begin anew. A long, surreal train ride across America is mildly disturbing to him, and the train's fireman lets Blake know that his destination - the town of "Machine" - is NO place to be. "The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body. The ball passes through her, and lodges near his heart. Blake fumbles with the woman's pistol, and manages to kill his attacker, which spells his doom. The Suitor was the son of the factory manager that rejected Blake, who then hires Bounty hunters to bring Blake in, dead or alive. Blake is now a hunted man, critically wounded, and sought by both the Law and hired killers. Blake narrowly escapes, with the unexpected aid of an Indian Shaman without a tribe, who calls himself "Nobody". What follows, is a surreal journey through the American West - Blake, assisted and sometimes harassed by Nobody, continues his journey to (he knows not where), with Nobody as guide and protector. Strange and malevolent encounters with men in the wilderness - all of them Desperadoes at some level - result in an increasing Body Count for Blake. Nobody is firmly convinced that Blake is the same William Blake as the English poet and author - Nobody tells Blake: "Now you are a killer of White Men. Your words will be written in blood". The strangeness of the encounters - the appearance of Benevolent Spirits to Blake in the camp's firelight - and an incredibly melancholy but sweet soundtrack (solo electric guitar, heavily Distorted with Reverb and Tremolo) by Neil Young - all contribute to an atmosphere of Foreboding. Is Blake already dead, and is this all a dream? This question begs the viewer to decide. I will not reveal any more of the story. I really hope that all the readers of these Reviews decide to see this movie for themselves. It is certainly Unique, and contains excellent acting by Gary Farmer, Lance Henrickson, and (darkly humorous) Billy Bob Thornton, to name just a few. Yes, it is a movie that reveals more, with successive viewings, than at first. Heavy use of Foreshadowing, and some Iconic displays (which may not be in harmony with the plot, but seem somehow appropriate anyway), also add to the feeling of Blake's journey. Of note, is the representation of the slaughter of Native Americans and their culture. The Death of their civilization is presented graphically, without words. Words are not necessary. Johnny Depp is, of course, brilliant in his role as William Blake - an innocent man, totally transformed and Metamorphosed into something else entirely.....but, IMHO, Gary Farmer is the most interesting Character in the movie. He is intelligent, articulate and actually well-educated in the White Man's ways, while still retaining some of the superstitious aspects of his Native culture. His character is the only really Humorous character in the story. He is kind-hearted and jovial by nature, but will kill without hesitation, if the need arises. I would grade this movie a "9" out of "10".

    I did not see the film Dead Man until after seeing Depp's film Lone Ranger. Wow, what a pair of films. Would make a great double bill. Dead Man is amazing. Really makes you think about near death experiences and what consciousness may be like in the dying process. Death may have occurred before the film even starts but the time of death doesn't matter. The point is not to get obsessed with exactly when he dies but to allow yourself to drift into an altered state of consciousness as Depp does. This is a major film achievement since actual death is something we can only imagine. I suspect film is one of the few ways we can get close to the experience while we are still alive. Jarmusch has done it with this film.

    Johnny Depp is one of the most talented & influential actors of the Modern-Era. His body of work proves that fact right! Having played some of the most twisted characters, Depp reinvents himself with his outstanding performance as a meek accountant in 'Dead Man'. WOW! 'Dead Man' Synopsis: On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake encounters a strange North American man named Nobody who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world. 'Dead Man', as a film, has the power to engross its viewer. Its an interesting film, that is executed sharply by Cult-Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch executes the film with style & a sense of wonderment, which works big time. The Narrative is crisp & even humorous at times. Jarmusch's Screenplay & Direction, both, are very well-done. Cinematography is fabulous. Editing is decent. Art Design is proper. Performance-Wise: Its a Johnny Depp Show All The Way! He's simply outstanding as the protagonist. This has to be Depp's finest performance from the mid 1990's. Gary Farmer is efficient. Crispin Glover & John Hurt are okay. Gabriel Byrne is ever-impressive. On the whole, 'Dead Man' is certainly a film worth watching.

    Dead Man is my 4th Jim Jarmusch film and it's a strange western that chronicles the death of a character played by Johnny Depp. This film is the very definition of a art-house western. It's weird, strange, shot in gorgeous black and white, stars a lot of actors you have seen before and it's weird. I enjoyed Dead Man quite a bit, but it din't resonate to me as much as Mystery Train or Ghost Dog did. The reason is very simple - Johnny Depp felt miscast in the role William Blake. Not saying he did a bad job, but he felt slightly off and out of place. As if he didn't belong in this film and that might the whole point of his character but it somehow disconnected me from the film. The rest of the film was excellent, featuring strange performances, bizarre scenes featuring well known character actors and so on. But by far the best thing in this film was Gary Farmer as Nobody. He played an interesting character and his performance was pure genius. I also liked the soundtrack done by Neil Young. I like his music and listening to him improvise the soundtrack is just amazing. So as far as the film goes, Dead Man is pretty good and interesting. I was hoping to be more drawn in by the lead performance but it didn't happen. Jarmusch should have cast Youki Kudoh in the lead or just about anyone who looks and feels out place, but has certain spark to their performance not just "I'm confused Johnny Depp Face".

    I am a big Bergman fan. Watching his slow filmed masterpieces I fall in love with magic of slow-paced filming. For shooting these scenes you must have knowledge like Ingmar, Tarkovsky, Kieslowsky... Jarmusch failed at all points... Johny Depp is the most overrated actor witch you can see in this movie and the many other ones-From Hell, Dark Shadows and many more. The plot is boring, and the black and white style is a big miss. With the spectrum of colors you can do anything, especially in movies like this one. I gave 5 to this movie only because I enjoyed Jarmusch's Ghost Dog, Night on Earth, Broken Flowers, Down by Law... Jarmusch's choice of Indian is desperate...I feel sorry for him, but this film is pure shit...5 out of 10.

    Those were the longest two hours I've ever experienced. And to top em off, I had an extra 30 minutes to go! Good God, what a drag this film is. This movie is nothing more than an overrated, pretentious pile of steaming camel excrement from the dreary, foul realms of Hell. The first quarter of this movie had me intrigued. There was a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere about it. But after that, it's just Johnny Depp and his racist Indian friend walking around in what-seems-to-be a forest (so much for a Western!) for the rest of the movie. The acting all around is so pathetic, especially by Depp. It almost seems as if he's barely even trying. It's just him wandering about speaking a few lines, then moving on. Of course, I'm not sure if he's to blame here, but overall, it's bad. The music is the WORST I've ever heard in a movie. EVER. It's just a distorted guitar motif on and off for the entire film - THE ENTIRE FILM! This movie being in black and white is nothing clever. Not like the pretentious hack Jim Jarmusch (director) would like to believe it is. It makes the entire film seem more uninspired and soulless. A useless strategy for a useless film. I can barely go on with this review like I could barely go on with the movie. Anyways, I'd like to point out that this is barely to be considered a Western film. If it is, then it gives the entire genre a bad name. The fact that I took time to write a review for this bloated piece of garbage is as generous as I could be. It's pretentious, boring, and an overall waste of time. If you watch this, then that'll be 120 minutes you will never retrieve. Avoid at all costs.

    I'll admit I didn't like this movie. Just not my sort of thing. However I did realize something later on. It distinctly feels like an interpretation of Dante's Inferno and Purgatory, the first two parts of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. It really hit me when I realized Nobody (this story's Virgil) baptizes William and casts him off to travel to paradise, while Nobody is left behind. Somehow, though I still don't like the movie, but I like seeing that symbolism in it. Plus Iggy Pop as the crazy robber/murderer was somewhat entertaining.

    Dead Man presents the bizarre journey of a meek, naive young accountant who, after getting haplessly entangled in a deadly maelstrom, goes through an intellectual and spiritual transformation that changes his life forever. While any typical road movie could have served as an effective vehicle for the propagation of this quaint tale, Jarmusch defiantly opts to make a Western based on his belief that the Western as a genre is "very open to metaphor, and has deep roots in classical narrative forms." But, Dead Man is far from being a conventional Western. Jarmusch basically leverages upon flexibility of the form and its umbilical link to America to concoct a far more complex work of art that not only transcends genres, but also deals with existential and spiritual motifs. With Dead Man, Jarmusch succeeds in giving the Western genre his personal touch by ingeniously building upon the aforementioned complex motifs to formulate a powerful cinematic treatise enriched with several vital elements of poetry: be it metaphors, symbolism, allusion, or imagery. Depp's character in Dead Man is a namesake of the English poet William Blake. The association obviously is not limited to the name alone. Dead Man has multiple references to the poetry of William Blake. In fact, most of Exaybachay's recitations in the movie are taken from Blake's poems like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Auguries of Innocence, The Everlasting Gospel, etc. Anyone who has seen the movie would remember the bizarrely sublime (taken from the aforementioned Marriage): "The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn from the crow." Thel (beautifully played by Mili Avital), the name of the prostitute who sells paper flowers, is also a reference to William Blake's The Book of Thel. And to top it all, the all-knowing Exaybachay, an ardent William Blake admirer, believes the accountant Blake to be a reincarnation of the dead English poet. Overall, Dead Man is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that is bound to elicit extreme responses from its audience: one would either love it or detest it, no midway affair. The deftly blended humor and suspense gives the movie an eerie tone which plainly reflects the nauseating feeling, as experienced by movie's characters, of being stuck in a limbo. An existential Western with surrealistic overtones, the movie is equally brilliant on both the technical and emotional fronts. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that Dead Man serves to be a brilliant showcase of the very best in direction, cinematography, music and acting. Dead Man is not a film for a casual viewer. The patient viewer, however, would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie may require multiple viewings for a clearer and deeper understanding. Dead Man is a must watch for anyone who values intelligent cinema that goes beyond the usual doze of entertainment and makes the viewer ruminate on what he saw long after the movie is over.

    Interesting idea but unfortunately not fully realized. Refreshing black-and-white photography. Nice sardonic touches. Has its moments -- but not all moments equally good. Unfortunately, its undeniable small virtues were completely spoiled (for me) by the random, ear-splitting, badly improvised twanging and banging on some over-loud stringed device from hell. The movie could easily stand on its own feet without any music, and it certainly was not helped by this pointless racket. I somehow expected a more surreal and other-worldly ascent into sheer imagination at the end -- something that black-and-white would lend itself to, but found the ending a little bathetic.

    William Blake, a young man from Ohio has lost his parents to illness, and heads West to begin anew. A long, surreal train ride across America is mildly disturbing to him, and the train's fireman lets Blake know that his destination - the town of "Machine" - is NO place to be. "The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body.

    Those were the longest two hours I've ever experienced. And to top em off, I had an extra 30 minutes to go! Good God, what a drag this film is. This movie is nothing more than an overrated, pretentious pile of steaming camel excrement from the dreary, foul realms of Hell. The first quarter of this movie had me intrigued. There was a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere about it. But after that, it's just Johnny Depp and his racist Indian friend walking around in what-seems-to-be a forest (so much for a Western!) for the rest of the movie. The acting all around is so pathetic, especially by Depp. It almost seems as if he's barely even trying. It's just him wandering about speaking a few lines, then moving on. Of course, I'm not sure if he's to blame here, but overall, it's bad. The music is the WORST I've ever heard in a movie. EVER. It's just a distorted guitar motif on and off for the entire film - THE ENTIRE FILM! This movie being in black and white is nothing clever. Not like the pretentious hack Jim Jarmusch (director) would like to believe it is. It makes the entire film seem more uninspired and soulless. A useless strategy for a useless film. I can barely go on with this review like I could barely go on with the movie. Anyways, I'd like to point out that this is barely to be considered a Western film. If it is, then it gives the entire genre a bad name. The fact that I took time to write a review for this bloated piece of garbage is as generous as I could be. It's pretentious, boring, and an overall waste of time. If you watch this, then that'll be 120 minutes you will never retrieve. Avoid at all costs.

    I'll admit I didn't like this movie. Just not my sort of thing. However I did realize something later on. It distinctly feels like an interpretation of Dante's Inferno and Purgatory, the first two parts of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. It really hit me when I realized Nobody (this story's Virgil) baptizes William and casts him off to travel to paradise, while Nobody is left behind. Somehow, though I still don't like the movie, but I like seeing that symbolism in it. Plus Iggy Pop as the crazy robber/murderer was somewhat entertaining.

    Dead Man presents the bizarre journey of a meek, naive young accountant who, after getting haplessly entangled in a deadly maelstrom, goes through an intellectual and spiritual transformation that changes his life forever. While any typical road movie could have served as an effective vehicle for the propagation of this quaint tale, Jarmusch defiantly opts to make a Western based on his belief that the Western as a genre is "very open to metaphor, and has deep roots in classical narrative forms." But, Dead Man is far from being a conventional Western. Jarmusch basically leverages upon flexibility of the form and its umbilical link to America to concoct a far more complex work of art that not only transcends genres, but also deals with existential and spiritual motifs. With Dead Man, Jarmusch succeeds in giving the Western genre his personal touch by ingeniously building upon the aforementioned complex motifs to formulate a powerful cinematic treatise enriched with several vital elements of poetry: be it metaphors, symbolism, allusion, or imagery. Depp's character in Dead Man is a namesake of the English poet William Blake. The association obviously is not limited to the name alone. Dead Man has multiple references to the poetry of William Blake. In fact, most of Exaybachay's recitations in the movie are taken from Blake's poems like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Auguries of Innocence, The Everlasting Gospel, etc. Anyone who has seen the movie would remember the bizarrely sublime (taken from the aforementioned Marriage): "The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn from the crow." Thel (beautifully played by Mili Avital), the name of the prostitute who sells paper flowers, is also a reference to William Blake's The Book of Thel. And to top it all, the all-knowing Exaybachay, an ardent William Blake admirer, believes the accountant Blake to be a reincarnation of the dead English poet. Overall, Dead Man is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that is bound to elicit extreme responses from its audience: one would either love it or detest it, no midway affair. The deftly blended humor and suspense gives the movie an eerie tone which plainly reflects the nauseating feeling, as experienced by movie's characters, of being stuck in a limbo. An existential Western with surrealistic overtones, the movie is equally brilliant on both the technical and emotional fronts. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that Dead Man serves to be a brilliant showcase of the very best in direction, cinematography, music and acting. Dead Man is not a film for a casual viewer. The patient viewer, however, would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie may require multiple viewings for a clearer and deeper understanding. Dead Man is a must watch for anyone who values intelligent cinema that goes beyond the usual doze of entertainment and makes the viewer ruminate on what he saw long after the movie is over.

    Interesting idea but unfortunately not fully realized. Refreshing black-and-white photography. Nice sardonic touches. Has its moments -- but not all moments equally good. Unfortunately, its undeniable small virtues were completely spoiled (for me) by the random, ear-splitting, badly improvised twanging and banging on some over-loud stringed device from hell. The movie could easily stand on its own feet without any music, and it certainly was not helped by this pointless racket. I somehow expected a more surreal and other-worldly ascent into sheer imagination at the end -- something that black-and-white would lend itself to, but found the ending a little bathetic.

    William Blake, a young man from Ohio has lost his parents to illness, and heads West to begin anew. A long, surreal train ride across America is mildly disturbing to him, and the train's fireman lets Blake know that his destination - the town of "Machine" - is NO place to be. "The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body. The ball passes through her, and lodges near his heart. Blake fumbles with the woman's pistol, and manages to kill his attacker, which spells his doom. The Suitor was the son of the factory manager that rejected Blake, who then hires Bounty hunters to bring Blake in, dead or alive. Blake is now a hunted man, critically wounded, and sought by both the Law and hired killers. Blake narrowly escapes, with the unexpected aid of an Indian Shaman without a tribe, who calls himself "Nobody". What follows, is a surreal journey through the American West - Blake, assisted and sometimes harassed by Nobody, continues his journey to (he knows not where), with Nobody as guide and protector. Strange and malevolent encounters with men in the wilderness - all of them Desperadoes at some level - result in an increasing Body Count for Blake. Nobody is firmly convinced that Blake is the same William Blake as the English poet and author - Nobody tells Blake: "Now you are a killer of White Men. Your words will be written in blood". The strangeness of the encounters - the appearance of Benevolent Spirits to Blake in the camp's firelight - and an incredibly melancholy but sweet soundtrack (solo electric guitar, heavily Distorted with Reverb and Tremolo) by Neil Young - all contribute to an atmosphere of Foreboding. Is Blake already dead, and is this all a dream? This question begs the viewer to decide. I will not reveal any more of the story. I really hope that all the readers of these Reviews decide to see this movie for themselves. It is certainly Unique, and contains excellent acting by Gary Farmer, Lance Henrickson, and (darkly humorous) Billy Bob Thornton, to name just a few. Yes, it is a movie that reveals more, with successive viewings, than at first. Heavy use of Foreshadowing, and some Iconic displays (which may not be in harmony with the plot, but seem somehow appropriate anyway), also add to the feeling of Blake's journey. Of note, is the representation of the slaughter of Native Americans and their culture. The Death of their civilization is presented graphically, without words. Words are not necessary. Johnny Depp is, of course, brilliant in his role as William Blake - an innocent man, totally transformed and Metamorphosed into something else entirely.....but, IMHO, Gary Farmer is the most interesting Character in the movie. He is intelligent, articulate and actually well-educated in the White Man's ways, while still retaining some of the superstitious aspects of his Native culture. His character is the only really Humorous character in the story. He is kind-hearted and jovial by nature, but will kill without hesitation, if the need arises. I would grade this movie a "9" out of "10".

    I did not see the film Dead Man until after seeing Depp's film Lone Ranger. Wow, what a pair of films. Would make a great double bill. Dead Man is amazing. Really makes you think about near death experiences and what consciousness may be like in the dying process. Death may have occurred before the film even starts but the time of death doesn't matter. The point is not to get obsessed with exactly when he dies but to allow yourself to drift into an altered state of consciousness as Depp does. This is a major film achievement since actual death is something we can only imagine. I suspect film is one of the few ways we can get close to the experience while we are still alive. Jarmusch has done it with this film.

    Johnny Depp is one of the most talented & influential actors of the Modern-Era. His body of work proves that fact right! Having played some of the most twisted characters, Depp reinvents himself with his outstanding performance as a meek accountant in 'Dead Man'. WOW! 'Dead Man' Synopsis: On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake encounters a strange North American man named Nobody who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world. 'Dead Man', as a film, has the power to engross its viewer. Its an interesting film, that is executed sharply by Cult-Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch executes the film with style & a sense of wonderment, which works big time. The Narrative is crisp & even humorous at times. Jarmusch's Screenplay & Direction, both, are very well-done. Cinematography is fabulous. Editing is decent. Art Design is proper. Performance-Wise: Its a Johnny Depp Show All The Way! He's simply outstanding as the protagonist. This has to be Depp's finest performance from the mid 1990's. Gary Farmer is efficient. Crispin Glover & John Hurt are okay. Gabriel Byrne is ever-impressive. On the whole, 'Dead Man' is certainly a film worth watching.

    Dead Man is my 4th Jim Jarmusch film and it's a strange western that chronicles the death of a character played by Johnny Depp. This film is the very definition of a art-house western. It's weird, strange, shot in gorgeous black and white, stars a lot of actors you have seen before and it's weird. I enjoyed Dead Man quite a bit, but it din't resonate to me as much as Mystery Train or Ghost Dog did. The reason is very simple - Johnny Depp felt miscast in the role William Blake. Not saying he did a bad job, but he felt slightly off and out of place. As if he didn't belong in this film and that might the whole point of his character but it somehow disconnected me from the film. The rest of the film was excellent, featuring strange performances, bizarre scenes featuring well known character actors and so on. But by far the best thing in this film was Gary Farmer as Nobody. He played an interesting character and his performance was pure genius. I also liked the soundtrack done by Neil Young. I like his music and listening to him improvise the soundtrack is just amazing. So as far as the film goes, Dead Man is pretty good and interesting. I was hoping to be more drawn in by the lead performance but it didn't happen. Jarmusch should have cast Youki Kudoh in the lead or just about anyone who looks and feels out place, but has certain spark to their performance not just "I'm confused Johnny Depp Face".

    I am a big Bergman fan. Watching his slow filmed masterpieces I fall in love with magic of slow-paced filming. For shooting these scenes you must have knowledge like Ingmar, Tarkovsky, Kieslowsky... Jarmusch failed at all points... Johny Depp is the most overrated actor witch you can see in this movie and the many other ones-From Hell, Dark Shadows and many more. The plot is boring, and the black and white style is a big miss. With the spectrum of colors you can do anything, especially in movies like this one. I gave 5 to this movie only because I enjoyed Jarmusch's Ghost Dog, Night on Earth, Broken Flowers, Down by Law... Jarmusch's choice of Indian is desperate...I feel sorry for him, but this film is pure shit...5 out of 10.

    Those were the longest two hours I've ever experienced. And to top em off, I had an extra 30 minutes to go! Good God, what a drag this film is. This movie is nothing more than an overrated, pretentious pile of steaming camel excrement from the dreary, foul realms of Hell. The first quarter of this movie had me intrigued. There was a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere about it. But after that, it's just Johnny Depp and his racist Indian friend walking around in what-seems-to-be a forest (so much for a Western!) for the rest of the movie. The acting all around is so pathetic, especially by Depp. It almost seems as if he's barely even trying. It's just him wandering about speaking a few lines, then moving on. Of course, I'm not sure if he's to blame here, but overall, it's bad. The music is the WORST I've ever heard in a movie. EVER. It's just a distorted guitar motif on and off for the entire film - THE ENTIRE FILM! This movie being in black and white is nothing clever. Not like the pretentious hack Jim Jarmusch (director) would like to believe it is. It makes the entire film seem more uninspired and soulless. A useless strategy for a useless film. I can barely go on with this review like I could barely go on with the movie. Anyways, I'd like to point out that this is barely to be considered a Western film. If it is, then it gives the entire genre a bad name. The fact that I took time to write a review for this bloated piece of garbage is as generous as I could be. It's pretentious, boring, and an overall waste of time. If you watch this, then that'll be 120 minutes you will never retrieve. Avoid at all costs.

    I'll admit I didn't like this movie. Just not my sort of thing. However I did realize something later on. It distinctly feels like an interpretation of Dante's Inferno and Purgatory, the first two parts of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. It really hit me when I realized Nobody (this story's Virgil) baptizes William and casts him off to travel to paradise, while Nobody is left behind. Somehow, though I still don't like the movie, but I like seeing that symbolism in it. Plus Iggy Pop as the crazy robber/murderer was somewhat entertaining.

"The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees.

    Dead Man is my 4th Jim Jarmusch film and it's a strange western that chronicles the death of a character played by Johnny Depp. This film is the very definition of a art-house western. It's weird, strange, shot in gorgeous black and white, stars a lot of actors you have seen before and it's weird. I enjoyed Dead Man quite a bit, but it din't resonate to me as much as Mystery Train or Ghost Dog did. The reason is very simple - Johnny Depp felt miscast in the role William Blake. Not saying he did a bad job, but he felt slightly off and out of place. As if he didn't belong in this film and that might the whole point of his character but it somehow disconnected me from the film. The rest of the film was excellent, featuring strange performances, bizarre scenes featuring well known character actors and so on. But by far the best thing in this film was Gary Farmer as Nobody. He played an interesting character and his performance was pure genius. I also liked the soundtrack done by Neil Young. I like his music and listening to him improvise the soundtrack is just amazing. So as far as the film goes, Dead Man is pretty good and interesting. I was hoping to be more drawn in by the lead performance but it didn't happen. Jarmusch should have cast Youki Kudoh in the lead or just about anyone who looks and feels out place, but has certain spark to their performance not just "I'm confused Johnny Depp Face".

    I am a big Bergman fan. Watching his slow filmed masterpieces I fall in love with magic of slow-paced filming. For shooting these scenes you must have knowledge like Ingmar, Tarkovsky, Kieslowsky... Jarmusch failed at all points... Johny Depp is the most overrated actor witch you can see in this movie and the many other ones-From Hell, Dark Shadows and many more. The plot is boring, and the black and white style is a big miss. With the spectrum of colors you can do anything, especially in movies like this one. I gave 5 to this movie only because I enjoyed Jarmusch's Ghost Dog, Night on Earth, Broken Flowers, Down by Law... Jarmusch's choice of Indian is desperate...I feel sorry for him, but this film is pure shit...5 out of 10.

    Those were the longest two hours I've ever experienced. And to top em off, I had an extra 30 minutes to go! Good God, what a drag this film is. This movie is nothing more than an overrated, pretentious pile of steaming camel excrement from the dreary, foul realms of Hell. The first quarter of this movie had me intrigued. There was a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere about it. But after that, it's just Johnny Depp and his racist Indian friend walking around in what-seems-to-be a forest (so much for a Western!) for the rest of the movie. The acting all around is so pathetic, especially by Depp. It almost seems as if he's barely even trying. It's just him wandering about speaking a few lines, then moving on. Of course, I'm not sure if he's to blame here, but overall, it's bad. The music is the WORST I've ever heard in a movie. EVER. It's just a distorted guitar motif on and off for the entire film - THE ENTIRE FILM! This movie being in black and white is nothing clever. Not like the pretentious hack Jim Jarmusch (director) would like to believe it is. It makes the entire film seem more uninspired and soulless. A useless strategy for a useless film. I can barely go on with this review like I could barely go on with the movie. Anyways, I'd like to point out that this is barely to be considered a Western film. If it is, then it gives the entire genre a bad name. The fact that I took time to write a review for this bloated piece of garbage is as generous as I could be. It's pretentious, boring, and an overall waste of time. If you watch this, then that'll be 120 minutes you will never retrieve. Avoid at all costs.

    I'll admit I didn't like this movie. Just not my sort of thing. However I did realize something later on. It distinctly feels like an interpretation of Dante's Inferno and Purgatory, the first two parts of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. It really hit me when I realized Nobody (this story's Virgil) baptizes William and casts him off to travel to paradise, while Nobody is left behind. Somehow, though I still don't like the movie, but I like seeing that symbolism in it. Plus Iggy Pop as the crazy robber/murderer was somewhat entertaining.

    Dead Man presents the bizarre journey of a meek, naive young accountant who, after getting haplessly entangled in a deadly maelstrom, goes through an intellectual and spiritual transformation that changes his life forever. While any typical road movie could have served as an effective vehicle for the propagation of this quaint tale, Jarmusch defiantly opts to make a Western based on his belief that the Western as a genre is "very open to metaphor, and has deep roots in classical narrative forms." But, Dead Man is far from being a conventional Western. Jarmusch basically leverages upon flexibility of the form and its umbilical link to America to concoct a far more complex work of art that not only transcends genres, but also deals with existential and spiritual motifs. With Dead Man, Jarmusch succeeds in giving the Western genre his personal touch by ingeniously building upon the aforementioned complex motifs to formulate a powerful cinematic treatise enriched with several vital elements of poetry: be it metaphors, symbolism, allusion, or imagery. Depp's character in Dead Man is a namesake of the English poet William Blake. The association obviously is not limited to the name alone. Dead Man has multiple references to the poetry of William Blake. In fact, most of Exaybachay's recitations in the movie are taken from Blake's poems like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Auguries of Innocence, The Everlasting Gospel, etc. Anyone who has seen the movie would remember the bizarrely sublime (taken from the aforementioned Marriage): "The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn from the crow." Thel (beautifully played by Mili Avital), the name of the prostitute who sells paper flowers, is also a reference to William Blake's The Book of Thel. And to top it all, the all-knowing Exaybachay, an ardent William Blake admirer, believes the accountant Blake to be a reincarnation of the dead English poet. Overall, Dead Man is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that is bound to elicit extreme responses from its audience: one would either love it or detest it, no midway affair. The deftly blended humor and suspense gives the movie an eerie tone which plainly reflects the nauseating feeling, as experienced by movie's characters, of being stuck in a limbo. An existential Western with surrealistic overtones, the movie is equally brilliant on both the technical and emotional fronts. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that Dead Man serves to be a brilliant showcase of the very best in direction, cinematography, music and acting. Dead Man is not a film for a casual viewer. The patient viewer, however, would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie may require multiple viewings for a clearer and deeper understanding. Dead Man is a must watch for anyone who values intelligent cinema that goes beyond the usual doze of entertainment and makes the viewer ruminate on what he saw long after the movie is over.

    Interesting idea but unfortunately not fully realized. Refreshing black-and-white photography. Nice sardonic touches. Has its moments -- but not all moments equally good. Unfortunately, its undeniable small virtues were completely spoiled (for me) by the random, ear-splitting, badly improvised twanging and banging on some over-loud stringed device from hell. The movie could easily stand on its own feet without any music, and it certainly was not helped by this pointless racket. I somehow expected a more surreal and other-worldly ascent into sheer imagination at the end -- something that black-and-white would lend itself to, but found the ending a little bathetic.

    William Blake, a young man from Ohio has lost his parents to illness, and heads West to begin anew. A long, surreal train ride across America is mildly disturbing to him, and the train's fireman lets Blake know that his destination - the town of "Machine" - is NO place to be. "The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body. The ball passes through her, and lodges near his heart. Blake fumbles with the woman's pistol, and manages to kill his attacker, which spells his doom. The Suitor was the son of the factory manager that rejected Blake, who then hires Bounty hunters to bring Blake in, dead or alive. Blake is now a hunted man, critically wounded, and sought by both the Law and hired killers. Blake narrowly escapes, with the unexpected aid of an Indian Shaman without a tribe, who calls himself "Nobody". What follows, is a surreal journey through the American West - Blake, assisted and sometimes harassed by Nobody, continues his journey to (he knows not where), with Nobody as guide and protector. Strange and malevolent encounters with men in the wilderness - all of them Desperadoes at some level - result in an increasing Body Count for Blake. Nobody is firmly convinced that Blake is the same William Blake as the English poet and author - Nobody tells Blake: "Now you are a killer of White Men. Your words will be written in blood". The strangeness of the encounters - the appearance of Benevolent Spirits to Blake in the camp's firelight - and an incredibly melancholy but sweet soundtrack (solo electric guitar, heavily Distorted with Reverb and Tremolo) by Neil Young - all contribute to an atmosphere of Foreboding. Is Blake already dead, and is this all a dream? This question begs the viewer to decide. I will not reveal any more of the story. I really hope that all the readers of these Reviews decide to see this movie for themselves. It is certainly Unique, and contains excellent acting by Gary Farmer, Lance Henrickson, and (darkly humorous) Billy Bob Thornton, to name just a few. Yes, it is a movie that reveals more, with successive viewings, than at first. Heavy use of Foreshadowing, and some Iconic displays (which may not be in harmony with the plot, but seem somehow appropriate anyway), also add to the feeling of Blake's journey. Of note, is the representation of the slaughter of Native Americans and their culture. The Death of their civilization is presented graphically, without words. Words are not necessary. Johnny Depp is, of course, brilliant in his role as William Blake - an innocent man, totally transformed and Metamorphosed into something else entirely.....but, IMHO, Gary Farmer is the most interesting Character in the movie. He is intelligent, articulate and actually well-educated in the White Man's ways, while still retaining some of the superstitious aspects of his Native culture. His character is the only really Humorous character in the story. He is kind-hearted and jovial by nature, but will kill without hesitation, if the need arises. I would grade this movie a "9" out of "10".

    I did not see the film Dead Man until after seeing Depp's film Lone Ranger. Wow, what a pair of films. Would make a great double bill. Dead Man is amazing. Really makes you think about near death experiences and what consciousness may be like in the dying process. Death may have occurred before the film even starts but the time of death doesn't matter. The point is not to get obsessed with exactly when he dies but to allow yourself to drift into an altered state of consciousness as Depp does. This is a major film achievement since actual death is something we can only imagine. I suspect film is one of the few ways we can get close to the experience while we are still alive. Jarmusch has done it with this film.

    Johnny Depp is one of the most talented & influential actors of the Modern-Era. His body of work proves that fact right! Having played some of the most twisted characters, Depp reinvents himself with his outstanding performance as a meek accountant in 'Dead Man'. WOW! 'Dead Man' Synopsis: On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake encounters a strange North American man named Nobody who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world. 'Dead Man', as a film, has the power to engross its viewer. Its an interesting film, that is executed sharply by Cult-Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch executes the film with style & a sense of wonderment, which works big time. The Narrative is crisp & even humorous at times. Jarmusch's Screenplay & Direction, both, are very well-done. Cinematography is fabulous. Editing is decent. Art Design is proper. Performance-Wise: Its a Johnny Depp Show All The Way! He's simply outstanding as the protagonist. This has to be Depp's finest performance from the mid 1990's. Gary Farmer is efficient. Crispin Glover & John Hurt are okay. Gabriel Byrne is ever-impressive. On the whole, 'Dead Man' is certainly a film worth watching.

Jarmusch should have cast Youki Kudoh in the lead or just about anyone who looks and feels out place, but has certain spark to their performance not just "I'm confused Johnny Depp Face".

For shooting these scenes you must have knowledge like Ingmar, Tarkovsky, Kieslowsky... Jarmusch failed at all points... Johny Depp is the most overrated actor witch you can see in this movie and the many other ones-From Hell, Dark Shadows and many more. The plot is boring, and the black and white style is a big miss. With the spectrum of colors you can do anything, especially in movies like this one. I gave 5 to this movie only because I enjoyed Jarmusch's Ghost Dog, Night on Earth, Broken Flowers, Down by Law...

    William Blake, a young man from Ohio has lost his parents to illness, and heads West to begin anew. A long, surreal train ride across America is mildly disturbing to him, and the train's fireman lets Blake know that his destination - the town of "Machine" - is NO place to be. "The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body. The ball passes through her, and lodges near his heart. Blake fumbles with the woman's pistol, and manages to kill his attacker, which spells his doom. The Suitor was the son of the factory manager that rejected Blake, who then hires Bounty hunters to bring Blake in, dead or alive. Blake is now a hunted man, critically wounded, and sought by both the Law and hired killers. Blake narrowly escapes, with the unexpected aid of an Indian Shaman without a tribe, who calls himself "Nobody". What follows, is a surreal journey through the American West - Blake, assisted and sometimes harassed by Nobody, continues his journey to (he knows not where), with Nobody as guide and protector. Strange and malevolent encounters with men in the wilderness - all of them Desperadoes at some level - result in an increasing Body Count for Blake. Nobody is firmly convinced that Blake is the same William Blake as the English poet and author - Nobody tells Blake: "Now you are a killer of White Men. Your words will be written in blood". The strangeness of the encounters - the appearance of Benevolent Spirits to Blake in the camp's firelight - and an incredibly melancholy but sweet soundtrack (solo electric guitar, heavily Distorted with Reverb and Tremolo) by Neil Young - all contribute to an atmosphere of Foreboding. Is Blake already dead, and is this all a dream? This question begs the viewer to decide. I will not reveal any more of the story. I really hope that all the readers of these Reviews decide to see this movie for themselves. It is certainly Unique, and contains excellent acting by Gary Farmer, Lance Henrickson, and (darkly humorous) Billy Bob Thornton, to name just a few. Yes, it is a movie that reveals more, with successive viewings, than at first. Heavy use of Foreshadowing, and some Iconic displays (which may not be in harmony with the plot, but seem somehow appropriate anyway), also add to the feeling of Blake's journey. Of note, is the representation of the slaughter of Native Americans and their culture. The Death of their civilization is presented graphically, without words. Words are not necessary. Johnny Depp is, of course, brilliant in his role as William Blake - an innocent man, totally transformed and Metamorphosed into something else entirely.....but, IMHO, Gary Farmer is the most interesting Character in the movie.

    I did not see the film Dead Man until after seeing Depp's film Lone Ranger. Wow, what a pair of films. Would make a great double bill. Dead Man is amazing. Really makes you think about near death experiences and what consciousness may be like in the dying process. Death may have occurred before the film even starts but the time of death doesn't matter. The point is not to get obsessed with exactly when he dies but to allow yourself to drift into an altered state of consciousness as Depp does. This is a major film achievement since actual death is something we can only imagine. I suspect film is one of the few ways we can get close to the experience while we are still alive. Jarmusch has done it with this film.

    Johnny Depp is one of the most talented & influential actors of the Modern-Era. His body of work proves that fact right! Having played some of the most twisted characters, Depp reinvents himself with his outstanding performance as a meek accountant in 'Dead Man'. WOW! 'Dead Man' Synopsis: On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake encounters a strange North American man named Nobody who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world. 'Dead Man', as a film, has the power to engross its viewer. Its an interesting film, that is executed sharply by Cult-Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch executes the film with style & a sense of wonderment, which works big time. The Narrative is crisp & even humorous at times. Jarmusch's Screenplay & Direction, both, are very well-done. Cinematography is fabulous. Editing is decent. Art Design is proper. Performance-Wise: Its a Johnny Depp Show All The Way! He's simply outstanding as the protagonist. This has to be Depp's finest performance from the mid 1990's. Gary Farmer is efficient. Crispin Glover & John Hurt are okay. Gabriel Byrne is ever-impressive. On the whole, 'Dead Man' is certainly a film worth watching.

    Dead Man is my 4th Jim Jarmusch film and it's a strange western that chronicles the death of a character played by Johnny Depp. This film is the very definition of a art-house western. It's weird, strange, shot in gorgeous black and white, stars a lot of actors you have seen before and it's weird. I enjoyed Dead Man quite a bit, but it din't resonate to me as much as Mystery Train or Ghost Dog did. The reason is very simple - Johnny Depp felt miscast in the role William Blake. Not saying he did a bad job, but he felt slightly off and out of place. As if he didn't belong in this film and that might the whole point of his character but it somehow disconnected me from the film. The rest of the film was excellent, featuring strange performances, bizarre scenes featuring well known character actors and so on. But by far the best thing in this film was Gary Farmer as Nobody. He played an interesting character and his performance was pure genius. I also liked the soundtrack done by Neil Young. I like his music and listening to him improvise the soundtrack is just amazing. So as far as the film goes, Dead Man is pretty good and interesting. I was hoping to be more drawn in by the lead performance but it didn't happen. Jarmusch should have cast Youki Kudoh in the lead or just about anyone who looks and feels out place, but has certain spark to their performance not just "I'm confused Johnny Depp Face".

    I am a big Bergman fan. Watching his slow filmed masterpieces I fall in love with magic of slow-paced filming. For shooting these scenes you must have knowledge like Ingmar, Tarkovsky, Kieslowsky... Jarmusch failed at all points... Johny Depp is the most overrated actor witch you can see in this movie and the many other ones-From Hell, Dark Shadows and many more. The plot is boring, and the black and white style is a big miss. With the spectrum of colors you can do anything, especially in movies like this one. I gave 5 to this movie only because I enjoyed Jarmusch's Ghost Dog, Night on Earth, Broken Flowers, Down by Law... Jarmusch's choice of Indian is desperate...I feel sorry for him, but this film is pure shit...5 out of 10.

    Those were the longest two hours I've ever experienced. And to top em off, I had an extra 30 minutes to go! Good God, what a drag this film is. This movie is nothing more than an overrated, pretentious pile of steaming camel excrement from the dreary, foul realms of Hell. The first quarter of this movie had me intrigued. There was a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere about it. But after that, it's just Johnny Depp and his racist Indian friend walking around in what-seems-to-be a forest (so much for a Western!) for the rest of the movie. The acting all around is so pathetic, especially by Depp. It almost seems as if he's barely even trying. It's just him wandering about speaking a few lines, then moving on. Of course, I'm not sure if he's to blame here, but overall, it's bad. The music is the WORST I've ever heard in a movie. EVER. It's just a distorted guitar motif on and off for the entire film - THE ENTIRE FILM! This movie being in black and white is nothing clever. Not like the pretentious hack Jim Jarmusch (director) would like to believe it is. It makes the entire film seem more uninspired and soulless. A useless strategy for a useless film. I can barely go on with this review like I could barely go on with the movie. Anyways, I'd like to point out that this is barely to be considered a Western film. If it is, then it gives the entire genre a bad name. The fact that I took time to write a review for this bloated piece of garbage is as generous as I could be. It's pretentious, boring, and an overall waste of time. If you watch this, then that'll be 120 minutes you will never retrieve. Avoid at all costs.

    Dead Man presents the bizarre journey of a meek, naive young accountant who, after getting haplessly entangled in a deadly maelstrom, goes through an intellectual and spiritual transformation that changes his life forever. While any typical road movie could have served as an effective vehicle for the propagation of this quaint tale, Jarmusch defiantly opts to make a Western based on his belief that the Western as a genre is "very open to metaphor, and has deep roots in classical narrative forms." But, Dead Man is far from being a conventional Western. Jarmusch basically leverages upon flexibility of the form and its umbilical link to America to concoct a far more complex work of art that not only transcends genres, but also deals with existential and spiritual motifs. With Dead Man, Jarmusch succeeds in giving the Western genre his personal touch by ingeniously building upon the aforementioned complex motifs to formulate a powerful cinematic treatise enriched with several vital elements of poetry: be it metaphors, symbolism, allusion, or imagery. Depp's character in Dead Man is a namesake of the English poet William Blake. The association obviously is not limited to the name alone. Dead Man has multiple references to the poetry of William Blake. In fact, most of Exaybachay's recitations in the movie are taken from Blake's poems like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Auguries of Innocence, The Everlasting Gospel, etc. Anyone who has seen the movie would remember the bizarrely sublime (taken from the aforementioned Marriage): "The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn from the crow." Thel (beautifully played by Mili Avital), the name of the prostitute who sells paper flowers, is also a reference to William Blake's The Book of Thel. And to top it all, the all-knowing Exaybachay, an ardent William Blake admirer, believes the accountant Blake to be a reincarnation of the dead English poet. Overall, Dead Man is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that is bound to elicit extreme responses from its audience: one would either love it or detest it, no midway affair. The deftly blended humor and suspense gives the movie an eerie tone which plainly reflects the nauseating feeling, as experienced by movie's characters, of being stuck in a limbo. An existential Western with surrealistic overtones, the movie is equally brilliant on both the technical and emotional fronts. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that Dead Man serves to be a brilliant showcase of the very best in direction, cinematography, music and acting. Dead Man is not a film for a casual viewer. The patient viewer, however, would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie may require multiple viewings for a clearer and deeper understanding. Dead Man is a must watch for anyone who values intelligent cinema that goes beyond the usual doze of entertainment and makes the viewer ruminate on what he saw long after the movie is over.

Unfortunately, its undeniable small virtues were completely spoiled (for me) by the random, ear-splitting, badly improvised twanging and banging on some over-loud stringed device from hell. The movie could easily stand on its own feet without any music, and it certainly was not helped by this pointless racket. I somehow expected a more surreal and other-worldly ascent into sheer imagination at the end -- something that black-and-white would lend itself to, but found the ending a little bathetic.

    William Blake, a young man from Ohio has lost his parents to illness, and heads West to begin anew. A long, surreal train ride across America is mildly disturbing to him, and the train's fireman lets Blake know that his destination - the town of "Machine" - is NO place to be. "The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body. The ball passes through her, and lodges near his heart. Blake fumbles with the woman's pistol, and manages to kill his attacker, which spells his doom. The Suitor was the son of the factory manager that rejected Blake, who then hires Bounty hunters to bring Blake in, dead or alive. Blake is now a hunted man, critically wounded, and sought by both the Law and hired killers. Blake narrowly escapes, with the unexpected aid of an Indian Shaman without a tribe, who calls himself "Nobody". What follows, is a surreal journey through the American West - Blake, assisted and sometimes harassed by Nobody, continues his journey to (he knows not where), with Nobody as guide and protector. Strange and malevolent encounters with men in the wilderness - all of them Desperadoes at some level - result in an increasing Body Count for Blake. Nobody is firmly convinced that Blake is the same William Blake as the English poet and author - Nobody tells Blake: "Now you are a killer of White Men. Your words will be written in blood". The strangeness of the encounters - the appearance of Benevolent Spirits to Blake in the camp's firelight - and an incredibly melancholy but sweet soundtrack (solo electric guitar, heavily Distorted with Reverb and Tremolo) by Neil Young - all contribute to an atmosphere of Foreboding. Is Blake already dead, and is this all a dream? This question begs the viewer to decide. I will not reveal any more of the story. I really hope that all the readers of these Reviews decide to see this movie for themselves. It is certainly Unique, and contains excellent acting by Gary Farmer, Lance Henrickson, and (darkly humorous) Billy Bob Thornton, to name just a few. Yes, it is a movie that reveals more, with successive viewings, than at first. Heavy use of Foreshadowing, and some Iconic displays (which may not be in harmony with the plot, but seem somehow appropriate anyway), also add to the feeling of Blake's journey. Of note, is the representation of the slaughter of Native Americans and their culture. The Death of their civilization is presented graphically, without words. Words are not necessary. Johnny Depp is, of course, brilliant in his role as William Blake - an innocent man, totally transformed and Metamorphosed into something else entirely.....but, IMHO, Gary Farmer is the most interesting Character in the movie. He is intelligent, articulate and actually well-educated in the White Man's ways, while still retaining some of the superstitious aspects of his Native culture. His character is the only really Humorous character in the story. He is kind-hearted and jovial by nature, but will kill without hesitation, if the need arises. I would grade this movie a "9" out of "10".

    I did not see the film Dead Man until after seeing Depp's film Lone Ranger. Wow, what a pair of films. Would make a great double bill. Dead Man is amazing. Really makes you think about near death experiences and what consciousness may be like in the dying process. Death may have occurred before the film even starts but the time of death doesn't matter. The point is not to get obsessed with exactly when he dies but to allow yourself to drift into an altered state of consciousness as Depp does. This is a major film achievement since actual death is something we can only imagine. I suspect film is one of the few ways we can get close to the experience while we are still alive.

This has to be Depp's finest performance from the mid 1990's. Gary Farmer is efficient. Crispin Glover & John Hurt are okay. Gabriel Byrne is ever-impressive. On the whole, 'Dead Man' is certainly a film worth watching.

    Interesting idea but unfortunately not fully realized. Refreshing black-and-white photography. Nice sardonic touches. Has its moments -- but not all moments equally good. Unfortunately, its undeniable small virtues were completely spoiled (for me) by the random, ear-splitting, badly improvised twanging and banging on some over-loud stringed device from hell. The movie could easily stand on its own feet without any music, and it certainly was not helped by this pointless racket. I somehow expected a more surreal and other-worldly ascent into sheer imagination at the end -- something that black-and-white would lend itself to, but found the ending a little bathetic.

"The end of the line!"... Seeking to accept a job offer in a metalworks, his rejection is met with gales of mirth from office employees. Up to that moment, his entire experience in "Machine" is a grim Foreshadowing, of a culture that is merciless, perverted and dangerously violent. Befriending a former prostitute, who takes him into her room for the night, Blake is surprised by a would-be Suitor of the prostitute, who shoots her, as she tries to shield Blake with her body. The ball passes through her, and lodges near his heart. Blake fumbles with the woman's pistol, and manages to kill his attacker, which spells his doom. The Suitor was the son of the factory manager that rejected Blake, who then hires Bounty hunters to bring Blake in, dead or alive. Blake is now a hunted man, critically wounded, and sought by both the Law and hired killers. Blake narrowly escapes, with the unexpected aid of an Indian Shaman without a tribe, who calls himself "Nobody". What follows, is a surreal journey through the American West - Blake, assisted and sometimes harassed by Nobody, continues his journey to (he knows not where), with Nobody as guide and protector. Strange and malevolent encounters with men in the wilderness - all of them Desperadoes at some level - result in an increasing Body Count for Blake. Nobody is firmly convinced that Blake is the same William Blake as the English poet and author - Nobody tells Blake: "Now you are a killer of White Men. Your words will be written in blood". The strangeness of the encounters - the appearance of Benevolent Spirits to Blake in the camp's firelight - and an incredibly melancholy but sweet soundtrack (solo electric guitar, heavily Distorted with Reverb and Tremolo) by Neil Young - all contribute to an atmosphere of Foreboding. Is Blake already dead, and is this all a dream? This question begs the viewer to decide. I will not reveal any more of the story. I really hope that all the readers of these Reviews decide to see this movie for themselves. It is certainly Unique, and contains excellent acting by Gary Farmer, Lance Henrickson, and (darkly humorous) Billy Bob Thornton, to name just a few. Yes, it is a movie that reveals more, with successive viewings, than at first. Heavy use of Foreshadowing, and some Iconic displays (which may not be in harmony with the plot, but seem somehow appropriate anyway), also add to the feeling of Blake's journey. Of note, is the representation of the slaughter of Native Americans and their culture. The Death of their civilization is presented graphically, without words. Words are not necessary. Johnny Depp is, of course, brilliant in his role as William Blake - an innocent man, totally transformed and Metamorphosed into something else entirely.....but, IMHO, Gary Farmer is the most interesting Character in the movie. He is intelligent, articulate and actually well-educated in the White Man's ways, while still retaining some of the superstitious aspects of his Native culture. His character is the only really Humorous character in the story. He is kind-hearted and jovial by nature, but will kill without hesitation, if the need arises. I would grade this movie a "9" out of "10".

    I did not see the film Dead Man until after seeing Depp's film Lone Ranger. Wow, what a pair of films. Would make a great double bill. Dead Man is amazing. Really makes you think about near death experiences and what consciousness may be like in the dying process. Death may have occurred before the film even starts but the time of death doesn't matter. The point is not to get obsessed with exactly when he dies but to allow yourself to drift into an altered state of consciousness as Depp does. This is a major film achievement since actual death is something we can only imagine. I suspect film is one of the few ways we can get close to the experience while we are still alive. Jarmusch has done it with this film.

    Johnny Depp is one of the most talented & influential actors of the Modern-Era. His body of work proves that fact right! Having played some of the most twisted characters, Depp reinvents himself with his outstanding performance as a meek accountant in 'Dead Man'. WOW! 'Dead Man' Synopsis: On the run after murdering a man, accountant William Blake encounters a strange North American man named Nobody who prepares him for his journey into the spiritual world. 'Dead Man', as a film, has the power to engross its viewer. Its an interesting film, that is executed sharply by Cult-Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch executes the film with style & a sense of wonderment, which works big time. The Narrative is crisp & even humorous at times. Jarmusch's Screenplay & Direction, both, are very well-done. Cinematography is fabulous. Editing is decent. Art Design is proper. Performance-Wise: Its a Johnny Depp Show All The Way! He's simply outstanding as the protagonist. This has to be Depp's finest performance from the mid 1990's. Gary Farmer is efficient. Crispin Glover & John Hurt are okay. Gabriel Byrne is ever-impressive. On the whole, 'Dead Man' is certainly a film worth watching.

    Dead Man is my 4th Jim Jarmusch film and it's a strange western that chronicles the death of a character played by Johnny Depp. This film is the very definition of a art-house western. It's weird, strange, shot in gorgeous black and white, stars a lot of actors you have seen before and it's weird. I enjoyed Dead Man quite a bit, but it din't resonate to me as much as Mystery Train or Ghost Dog did. The reason is very simple - Johnny Depp felt miscast in the role William Blake. Not saying he did a bad job, but he felt slightly off and out of place. As if he didn't belong in this film and that might the whole point of his character but it somehow disconnected me from the film. The rest of the film was excellent, featuring strange performances, bizarre scenes featuring well known character actors and so on. But by far the best thing in this film was Gary Farmer as Nobody. He played an interesting character and his performance was pure genius. I also liked the soundtrack done by Neil Young. I like his music and listening to him improvise the soundtrack is just amazing. So as far as the film goes, Dead Man is pretty good and interesting. I was hoping to be more drawn in by the lead performance but it didn't happen. Jarmusch should have cast Youki Kudoh in the lead or just about anyone who looks and feels out place, but has certain spark to their performance not just "I'm confused Johnny Depp Face".

    I am a big Bergman fan. Watching his slow filmed masterpieces I fall in love with magic of slow-paced filming. For shooting these scenes you must have knowledge like Ingmar, Tarkovsky, Kieslowsky... Jarmusch failed at all points... Johny Depp is the most overrated actor witch you can see in this movie and the many other ones-From Hell, Dark Shadows and many more. The plot is boring, and the black and white style is a big miss. With the spectrum of colors you can do anything, especially in movies like this one. I gave 5 to this movie only because I enjoyed Jarmusch's Ghost Dog, Night on Earth, Broken Flowers, Down by Law... Jarmusch's choice of Indian is desperate...I feel sorry for him, but this film is pure shit...5 out of 10.

    Those were the longest two hours I've ever experienced. And to top em off, I had an extra 30 minutes to go! Good God, what a drag this film is. This movie is nothing more than an overrated, pretentious pile of steaming camel excrement from the dreary, foul realms of Hell. The first quarter of this movie had me intrigued. There was a gloomy and mysterious atmosphere about it. But after that, it's just Johnny Depp and his racist Indian friend walking around in what-seems-to-be a forest (so much for a Western!) for the rest of the movie. The acting all around is so pathetic, especially by Depp. It almost seems as if he's barely even trying. It's just him wandering about speaking a few lines, then moving on. Of course, I'm not sure if he's to blame here, but overall, it's bad. The music is the WORST I've ever heard in a movie. EVER. It's just a distorted guitar motif on and off for the entire film - THE ENTIRE FILM! This movie being in black and white is nothing clever. Not like the pretentious hack Jim Jarmusch (director) would like to believe it is. It makes the entire film seem more uninspired and soulless. A useless strategy for a useless film. I can barely go on with this review like I could barely go on with the movie. Anyways, I'd like to point out that this is barely to be considered a Western film. If it is, then it gives the entire genre a bad name. The fact that I took time to write a review for this bloated piece of garbage is as generous as I could be. It's pretentious, boring, and an overall waste of time. If you watch this, then that'll be 120 minutes you will never retrieve. Avoid at all costs.

    I'll admit I didn't like this movie. Just not my sort of thing. However I did realize something later on. It distinctly feels like an interpretation of Dante's Inferno and Purgatory, the first two parts of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. It really hit me when I realized Nobody (this story's Virgil) baptizes William and casts him off to travel to paradise, while Nobody is left behind. Somehow, though I still don't like the movie, but I like seeing that symbolism in it. Plus Iggy Pop as the crazy robber/murderer was somewhat entertaining.

    A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Jarmusch's psychedelic Western that deals with existentialism and spirituality

    Dead Man presents the bizarre journey of a meek, naive young accountant who, after getting haplessly entangled in a deadly maelstrom, goes through an intellectual and spiritual transformation that changes his life forever. While any typical road movie could have served as an effective vehicle for the propagation of this quaint tale, Jarmusch defiantly opts to make a Western based on his belief that the Western as a genre is "very open to metaphor, and has deep roots in classical narrative forms." But, Dead Man is far from being a conventional Western. Jarmusch basically leverages upon flexibility of the form and its umbilical link to America to concoct a far more complex work of art that not only transcends genres, but also deals with existential and spiritual motifs. With Dead Man, Jarmusch succeeds in giving the Western genre his personal touch by ingeniously building upon the aforementioned complex motifs to formulate a powerful cinematic treatise enriched with several vital elements of poetry: be it metaphors, symbolism, allusion, or imagery. Depp's character in Dead Man is a namesake of the English poet William Blake. The association obviously is not limited to the name alone. Dead Man has multiple references to the poetry of William Blake. In fact, most of Exaybachay's recitations in the movie are taken from Blake's poems like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Auguries of Innocence, The Everlasting Gospel, etc. Anyone who has seen the movie would remember the bizarrely sublime (taken from the aforementioned Marriage): "The eagle never lost so much time, as when he submitted to learn from the crow." Thel (beautifully played by Mili Avital), the name of the prostitute who sells paper flowers, is also a reference to William Blake's The Book of Thel. And to top it all, the all-knowing Exaybachay, an ardent William Blake admirer, believes the accountant Blake to be a reincarnation of the dead English poet. Overall, Dead Man is an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that is bound to elicit extreme responses from its audience: one would either love it or detest it, no midway affair. The deftly blended humor and suspense gives the movie an eerie tone which plainly reflects the nauseating feeling, as experienced by movie's characters, of being stuck in a limbo. An existential Western with surrealistic overtones, the movie is equally brilliant on both the technical and emotional fronts. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that Dead Man serves to be a brilliant showcase of the very best in direction, cinematography, music and acting. Dead Man is not a film for a casual viewer. The patient viewer, however, would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie may require multiple viewings for a clearer and deeper understanding. Dead Man is a must watch for anyone who values intelligent cinema that goes beyond the usual doze of entertainment and makes the viewer ruminate on what he saw long after the movie is over.

    Interesting idea but unfortunately not fully realized. Refreshing black-and-white photography. Nice sardonic touches. Has its moments -- but not all moments equally good. Unfortunately, its undeniable small virtues were completely spoiled (for me) by the random, ear-splitting, badly improvised twanging and banging on some over-loud stringed device from hell. The movie could easily stand on its own feet without any music, and it certainly was not helped by this pointless racket. I somehow expected a more surreal and other-worldly ascent into sheer imagination at the end -- something that black-and-white would lend itself to, but found the ending a little bathetic.

    Dead man ( 1994 ) Johny Depp A black and white American classic for hardcore cinephiles .The central character molded on the 17th century English poet painter William Blake , on a spiritual journey . Beginning as an aspiring accountant forgetting his poetic past he begins his journey from the cut throat corrupt immoral metal mining bad town at faraway place close to the "Injun" land , learns what is cheating and treachery , quintessential to the real world capitalism .Being falsely accused of murder , hunted by the cannibal representative of uncle Sam eminently played by Lance Henrikssen ( who kills and eats the colored and Scottish origin co bounty hunters ) , helped by the Indian tribesman with ancient spiritual wisdom , who already had vision about the certain fate of death of Blake . The gun vending priest ( Alfred Molina as the trade post missionary ) all representing every modern day ills and evil of the Western society desperately trying to bring down the honest man Blake ( the 17th century poet was well known for his anti establishment stance after his demise ) . This fantastic classic of a movie needs repeat viewings to get a full grasp of the enormous and deep theme embedded within , reminded me of O'Brother .. where art thou ( 2000 , George Clooney ) another social satire masterpiece !!!
