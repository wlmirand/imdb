    I really enjoyed this movie, as an owner now of 4 dogs, and as a kid when I had a dog ,, I used to share lunch with the dog,, talk to him/her... play all the things kids do with dogs.. this movie just rocks.. I so hated buddy's first owner,, the stupid clown,, oh so happy when the kid decides to take action against the clown. as far as a dog playing basketball I actually wouldn't put it past an actual real life dog to do it being properly trained and all, the only thing I feel that's a little far fetched is the poor dog wearing those tiny dog slippers tell me how a golden retriever is gonna run up and down the basketball court in sneakers,, but other than that I really just loved this movie,, it's a movie for all ages 9-99. enjoy folks.

    The first of the 'Air Bud' series is as much wonderful as it is horribly underrated, truly a 90's classic. It has a dignified place in the list of the greatest animal movies as well. In many ways it is a depressing movie but it's also heart-warming, touching, feel-good and tons of fun. There's more to it to like, though. Cinematography is really beautiful and pure. The soundtrack is just perfect for this film. The boy and his devoted four-legged friend make a marvelous team and have a perfect chemistry. Even though the film's title obviously refers to the dog, his name is actually Buddy - that is, once he ends up in the hands of Josh Framm. Even as the movie starts, the little we see is enough to realize how horribly the clown treats his dog (constantly yelling at him and hitting him hard with the newspaper). It is heartbreaking to see that. Fortunately, this horrible man accidentally loses him and he finds Josh Framm (a, I assume, 12-year-old who is loving and caring but very shy and silent and currently under a depressive mood). They quickly become best friends, as Josh gives him the treatment he deserves. Buddy is a very special dog alone, but he has a special secret that makes him even more special: he can play basketball (even more amazing, better than humans can!). Even though the clown is a horrible person, he doesn't have that much of a role. He is not someone I sympathize and he certainly isn't funny, although it is hilarious when his truck starts to fall apart and he can't stop it and accidentally drives it into the river. Larry Willingham's father is a jerk. Even though Larry unfairly picks on Josh, at least he isn't too bratty and is funny at times. But Larry's father, that guy is such a jerk, although not overly annoying. Coach Joe isn't especially sympathetic because he is very impatient and temperamental, but he goes too far when he throws basketballs at Josh's peculiar friend Tom with aggressiveness. The movie is focused more on Josh and Buddy, who are the most likable characters of the movie. Kevin Zegers is flawless as Josh Framm. Buddy the Dog is amazing as Buddy (may this wonderful dog rest in peace, wherever he is now). Brendan Fletcher does a good job as Larry. So does Shayn Solberg as Josh's good friend Tom. The late Eric Christmas is hilarious as Judge Cranfield. Title in Portugal: 'Air Bud'.

    Looking for a great sports movie with touching scenes and some unique players? Well then this is a movie for you. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Julianna No one (age 12) shares her review below: Video review available here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FORlwS-_E This movie stars Kevin Zeggers as Josh Framm, Wendy Makkena as Jackie Framm, and Michael Jeter as Norm Snively the clown. This film is about a boy who is new to town. One day while playing basketball Josh finds Bud, a abandoned dog. Bud gives Josh faith in himself which leads him to try out for the basketball team. Josh learns that Bud can play basketball too. Josh and Bud just have to be aware of Bud's old abusive owner, Norm Snively the clown. My favorite character is Bud. I like Bud because of his unbiased love of Josh and because Josh and his family took Bud in when his old abusive owner was about to take him to the pound. However, I like him mostly because he is talented and it is pretty cool that he can play basketball. My favorite scenes are when Bud decides to bite his old owner Norm the clown and runs back to his new family, Josh and the rest of the Framms. My other favorite scene is when Bud actually plays for Josh's team because one player is injured and another fouls out of the game. What I like about this movie is how well the stunt coordinator trained Bud, so in the movie he has such great aptitude or talent. The cinematography is well done and how it is anthropomorphic in how Bud is able to play basketball, like he is just another kid on the team. I think that people who love animals, sports and comedy mixed with a little heart warming scenes will absolutely love this incredible film. I know this because I really love this film and I hope you will as well. Also even if you don't really like sports or animal movies you will still enjoy this film as it has a great story to follow. This movie is great for the whole family. There is a strong moral to the story as well as many emotionally gripping scenes for everyone to enjoy. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars because it is a great movie that everyone can sit down and enjoy.

    (Some Spoilers) After being abandoned on the highway by his master the drunken clown Norm Snively played by Michael Jeter, no relations to Yankee star infielder Derek, Buddy the dog is befriended by young Josh Framm, Kevin Zegers, who found Buddy lost and hungry wandering around in the woods. Josh is having trouble adjusting to his new life in Fernfield Washington and Buddy is just what he needs, a friend, to spend his time with. As it soon turns out Buddy has this talent in shooting basketballs through hoops by bouncing them off his snout that can put Michael Jordon and Jerry West to shame! The film has Josh together with his dog Buddy become the sensation of Fernfield High School who do a half-time show that's draws more people them the basketball game itself. It's the teams new coach school janitor and boiler room attendant,it gets real cold up there in Washington State during the winter, former professional basketball player for the New York Knicks Arthur Chaney, Bill Cobbs,who sees potential in Buddy's,the team's mascot, ability to play on the team and waits just for the right moment to put him into the game. That comes at the critical game for the state championship honors between Coach Chaney's Timberwolves and last years champions Warriors! It's during this time that Buddy's former owner Snively, while recovering from the DT's, sees Buddy on the local TV news shooting baskets and a light bulb lights up in his head. Seeing dollar signs and six packs of beer in his future Snively decides to get Buddy back legally despite having abandoned him months ago. Something that both Buddy and his new found friend Josh will do everything in their power to prevent. Corny at times but heart warming film with the sharp shooting Buddy, who sadly passed away six months after the films release, making every basket count as well as stealing ever scene in the movie. Not only was Buddy able to score points but as Coach Chaney predicted motivate the players, especially Josh, to improve their game as well. While Snively tried to get Buddy back and make money with him by doing beer and dog food commercials the dog with Josh's help escaped and ended up in court in a dog custody case with Josh and Snively as the complainants. ***SPOILERS***Even though the presiding judge in the case Judge Cornfield, played by Eric Christmas,is a big Knick, as well as former Knick player Arthur Chaney, fan and was very sympathetic for Josh in seeing what a crazy nut, coming to court dressed up as Bozo the clown, Sinvely was it was in fact Buddy who made the decision to whom he want's to stay with. And as it turned out that decision was final!

    I loved this movie when I was a kid, and even back then I had little idea why. I mean, it wasn't like I thought it was particularly funny or touching or anything like that. I guess I just really liked the basic premise, because you have to admit the central idea is pretty weird and nutty. How stoned do you have to get before you come up with a dog that plays basketball? How would that even remotely work? I'm really putting too much thought in this movie I guess, but it's just so bizarre that I've always found it very entertaining. I've learned the sequels actually stretch the premise even further and involve dogs that can play soccer, baseball and volleyball, but this one will always be the one and only original "dog does weird athletic stuff it can't possibly do"-flick.

    Air Bud is far from a classic, but I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. As far as dog movies go, Lassie Come Home and Old Yeller are the best in my opinion, but Air Bud is not a bad family movie at all. It is too short though, and there is some uneven direction and some hit and misses in the script, However, some of it is fitfully amusing, and the story is appealing. And the characters are engaging, especially Buddy and Josh, those two have great chemistry together. Kevin Zegers is likable enough, while Buddy steals the film whether it is the stunts or the bonding scenes. Air Bud is nice to look at, and the soundtrack is decent. But I have to give special mention to the acrobatics, because they are amazing. All in all, an entertaining and likable film, not perfect but decent family fare without taking itself too seriously. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    After a kids dad dies he moves to a new city where he finds himself lost and alone. His passion is basketball, but hes kind of shy and weird around kids and doesn't try out for the team at first. He finds a stray dog and soon learns the dog can actually shoot hoops with his nose. After a while he joins the team and soon the whole town witnesses the dogs talents and he ends up on the team. Soon, once the original owner of the dog who hated him finds out the dog is famous he comes back to claim him for his own. I had watched this movie a few times years ago and it was just another predictable happy ending kids film. I must admit there's hundreds of thousands of these movies made and they are all pretty much the same. Good for a kid to set down and kept shut up for an hour and a half. You know how they are gonna end and what the story is all about just by looking at the cover art. I didn't hate it, but it offered nothing great. I like Kevin Zegers and I had watched this a few times 12 or 13 years ago when it came out and thought it was okay for a kids movie. Eric Christmas does good as the judge and Michael Jeter plays a good bad guy here.. I always give credit to directors who work with animals, it cannot be an easy job. The director of this film made an old horror movie from 86 I love called Trick or Treat so thats a cool plus for me. Watch it and decide for yourself but you aren't seeing anything new here. Maybe a dog playing basketball isn't that heard of or seen, but it's not too impressive and the story itself is middle of the road 3/10 stars.

    Although this family sports movie was released in 1997, I believe I saw it for the first time in 2001. I was in my early teens at the time, and it definitely didn't turn out to be one of my all-time favourite movies, but I think I was impressed with a lot of it. I certainly wasn't bored. If I remember correctly, what I liked the most about "Air Bud" was the dog, since I found him so cute. I think he often put a smile on my face, at least early in the film. However, if I hadn't seen the film years ago, I doubt I would have ever bothered watching it, but since I remembered it, I decided to watch it again eight years later. This time, I knew it wasn't a very popular movie, and unsurprisingly, I noticed some flaws I hadn't noticed before. Josh Framm is a boy who has just moved to Fernfield, Washington with his mother and younger sister after the tragic death of his father. At school in this town, he has no friends, and despite his interest in basketball, he is too shy to try out for the school's team. He discovers an abandoned basketball court in the town, and starts shooting hoops there. He also meets a stray golden retriever in that area, one who was lost by his abusive owner, a clown named Norm Snively, when he fell out of his truck. Josh quickly befriends this dog, naming him Buddy, and sees that he's also good at basketball! Eventually, Josh does make the school team, and Buddy soon joins in, which brings him a lot of attention. Unfortunately, however, after Norm Snively sees his lost dog on TV, he wants him back. The relationship between the boy and the dog could be in trouble, and so could the team! This movie is hands down a failure when it comes to humour. This includes the beginning, with Norm Snively, played by Michael Jeter, at a birthday party with Buddy (before he loses him), trying to entertain a bunch of kids, which leads to some weak slapstick, making a huge mess in the house. The scene where Josh's mother sees Buddy for the first time is a lot like that, with more unfunny slapstick leading to a huge mess. Norm is supposed to be a really funny character, but VERY rarely is. As for the serious parts, they're not terrible, but aren't really that gripping or anything. A bit of emotion or tension wasn't enough to make it satisfying. Basically, "Air Bud" is another mediocre modern-day PG-rated kiddie flick, but I guess it's harmless, and many kids could enjoy it. As for me, I'm going to have to move on, and not bother watching this movie's one theatrical sequel or any of its many direct-to-video sequels.

    I am in disbelief right now, seeing all these horrible comments about a great family movie. I grew up loving all of the air bud movies, especially the first one. It really is a feel good movie, and I found it realistic. You have a young boy, who is struggling because of his fathers death, and he really does not have anything to look forward too. But when buddy comes into his life, everything changes. He is having a lot more fun, and you can see that throughout this movie. How can anyone say this is movie has no plot? The plot centers around a boy struggling, looking for something, and finds it in Buddy I know it is not real realistic for a dog to play basketball, but honestly, i could care less. This is a great family movie, one that i would recommend to anyone.

    'Air Bud' is one of "doggy" movies so much in fashion in its time. And it's surprisingly underrated. This is by no means a comedy, although it has its funny moments. It is dramatic, more than anything. In fact, this is often a depressing film but joyful at the same time. Unlike its sequels, this one has a clever plot (a sentimental one, I'd say). It's heartwarming, in the line of others like this such as 'Old Yeller', 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey', 'Napoleon' and 'Fluke'. Despite the title, the story isn't just about our very dear canine friend Buddy (even if he is the main star). The story also focus on Josh Framm, who is a crucial character, together with the dog. After all, they are destined to be best friends. Josh is Buddy's salvation, but Buddy also plays an important role to save Josh's life. Buddy escapes from his alcoholic and aggressive owner and finds a peaceful life with Josh. On the other hand, Josh gets over depression and shyness thanks to Buddy, which gives the him will to live and brings back Josh's lost interest in basketball. That's when the movie's most original thing happens: Buddy can play basketball! That is just amazing! Like everybody else in the movie, to see the dog playing basketball leaves me speechless. That dog has an incredible talent for basketball and even more unbelievable is that he never fails. He's a much better and natural-born player than the humans themselves. He becomes the mascot of Josh's basketball team... which brings them lots of luck. The beauty of this movie isn't just in the dramatic story, but also in the friendship between Josh and man's best friend. Plus, Buddy is a Golden Retriever, my favorite dog breed. Golden Retrievers look so friendly and pacific. They are in fact. They are among the world's sweetest and most beautiful dogs. But the magnificent scenario also gives beauty to the movie: rivers, green places, a nice village. All of this is very well combined with soft, relaxing and beautiful piano music (like in "Fluke"). Tom is an eccentric boy who always carries minor pieces of garbage to give him luck. It is, however, a bit disturbing to see that Joe coach throwing him numerous basketballs, causing the boy to shake nervously and feel very tired. Larry, although constantly picking on Josh, isn't really annoying or stupid. He is more of an arrogant and jealous guy than actually mean. Despite having some deeply touching moments, the most heartbreaking moment of the movie is when Buddy crosses the river and tries to follow the river boat which Josh catches. That scene always makes tears come to my eyes. As for the cast, Kevin Zegers (a sports boy in real life, just like Noah Hathaway) is wonderful in the role of Josh Framm and Buddy the Dog is simply fantastic as Buddy. I was so sad when I found out that Buddy died. He was a friendly, adorable, beautiful and very talented dog. The little girl who plays Josh's cute little sister (whoever she is) is alright either. But I don't like some of the characters at all. Norm Snively is a drunk, abusive man and a loser as a clown. Coach Joe is a jerk and unkind. Larry's father is a jerk and a hypocrite. This should definitely be on Top 250.

And as it turned out that decision was final!

    I loved this movie when I was a kid, and even back then I had little idea why. I mean, it wasn't like I thought it was particularly funny or touching or anything like that. I guess I just really liked the basic premise, because you have to admit the central idea is pretty weird and nutty. How stoned do you have to get before you come up with a dog that plays basketball? How would that even remotely work? I'm really putting too much thought in this movie I guess, but it's just so bizarre that I've always found it very entertaining. I've learned the sequels actually stretch the premise even further and involve dogs that can play soccer, baseball and volleyball, but this one will always be the one and only original "dog does weird athletic stuff it can't possibly do"-flick.

    Air Bud is far from a classic, but I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. As far as dog movies go, Lassie Come Home and Old Yeller are the best in my opinion, but Air Bud is not a bad family movie at all. It is too short though, and there is some uneven direction and some hit and misses in the script, However, some of it is fitfully amusing, and the story is appealing. And the characters are engaging, especially Buddy and Josh, those two have great chemistry together. Kevin Zegers is likable enough, while Buddy steals the film whether it is the stunts or the bonding scenes. Air Bud is nice to look at, and the soundtrack is decent. But I have to give special mention to the acrobatics, because they are amazing. All in all, an entertaining and likable film, not perfect but decent family fare without taking itself too seriously. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    After a kids dad dies he moves to a new city where he finds himself lost and alone. His passion is basketball, but hes kind of shy and weird around kids and doesn't try out for the team at first. He finds a stray dog and soon learns the dog can actually shoot hoops with his nose. After a while he joins the team and soon the whole town witnesses the dogs talents and he ends up on the team. Soon, once the original owner of the dog who hated him finds out the dog is famous he comes back to claim him for his own. I had watched this movie a few times years ago and it was just another predictable happy ending kids film. I must admit there's hundreds of thousands of these movies made and they are all pretty much the same. Good for a kid to set down and kept shut up for an hour and a half. You know how they are gonna end and what the story is all about just by looking at the cover art. I didn't hate it, but it offered nothing great. I like Kevin Zegers and I had watched this a few times 12 or 13 years ago when it came out and thought it was okay for a kids movie. Eric Christmas does good as the judge and Michael Jeter plays a good bad guy here.. I always give credit to directors who work with animals, it cannot be an easy job. The director of this film made an old horror movie from 86 I love called Trick or Treat so thats a cool plus for me. Watch it and decide for yourself but you aren't seeing anything new here. Maybe a dog playing basketball isn't that heard of or seen, but it's not too impressive and the story itself is middle of the road 3/10 stars.

    Although this family sports movie was released in 1997, I believe I saw it for the first time in 2001. I was in my early teens at the time, and it definitely didn't turn out to be one of my all-time favourite movies, but I think I was impressed with a lot of it. I certainly wasn't bored. If I remember correctly, what I liked the most about "Air Bud" was the dog, since I found him so cute. I think he often put a smile on my face, at least early in the film. However, if I hadn't seen the film years ago, I doubt I would have ever bothered watching it, but since I remembered it, I decided to watch it again eight years later. This time, I knew it wasn't a very popular movie, and unsurprisingly, I noticed some flaws I hadn't noticed before. Josh Framm is a boy who has just moved to Fernfield, Washington with his mother and younger sister after the tragic death of his father. At school in this town, he has no friends, and despite his interest in basketball, he is too shy to try out for the school's team. He discovers an abandoned basketball court in the town, and starts shooting hoops there. He also meets a stray golden retriever in that area, one who was lost by his abusive owner, a clown named Norm Snively, when he fell out of his truck. Josh quickly befriends this dog, naming him Buddy, and sees that he's also good at basketball! Eventually, Josh does make the school team, and Buddy soon joins in, which brings him a lot of attention. Unfortunately, however, after Norm Snively sees his lost dog on TV, he wants him back. The relationship between the boy and the dog could be in trouble, and so could the team! This movie is hands down a failure when it comes to humour. This includes the beginning, with Norm Snively, played by Michael Jeter, at a birthday party with Buddy (before he loses him), trying to entertain a bunch of kids, which leads to some weak slapstick, making a huge mess in the house. The scene where Josh's mother sees Buddy for the first time is a lot like that, with more unfunny slapstick leading to a huge mess. Norm is supposed to be a really funny character, but VERY rarely is. As for the serious parts, they're not terrible, but aren't really that gripping or anything. A bit of emotion or tension wasn't enough to make it satisfying. Basically, "Air Bud" is another mediocre modern-day PG-rated kiddie flick, but I guess it's harmless, and many kids could enjoy it. As for me, I'm going to have to move on, and not bother watching this movie's one theatrical sequel or any of its many direct-to-video sequels.

    I am in disbelief right now, seeing all these horrible comments about a great family movie. I grew up loving all of the air bud movies, especially the first one. It really is a feel good movie, and I found it realistic. You have a young boy, who is struggling because of his fathers death, and he really does not have anything to look forward too. But when buddy comes into his life, everything changes. He is having a lot more fun, and you can see that throughout this movie. How can anyone say this is movie has no plot? The plot centers around a boy struggling, looking for something, and finds it in Buddy I know it is not real realistic for a dog to play basketball, but honestly, i could care less. This is a great family movie, one that i would recommend to anyone.

    'Air Bud' is one of "doggy" movies so much in fashion in its time. And it's surprisingly underrated. This is by no means a comedy, although it has its funny moments. It is dramatic, more than anything. In fact, this is often a depressing film but joyful at the same time. Unlike its sequels, this one has a clever plot (a sentimental one, I'd say). It's heartwarming, in the line of others like this such as 'Old Yeller', 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey', 'Napoleon' and 'Fluke'. Despite the title, the story isn't just about our very dear canine friend Buddy (even if he is the main star). The story also focus on Josh Framm, who is a crucial character, together with the dog. After all, they are destined to be best friends. Josh is Buddy's salvation, but Buddy also plays an important role to save Josh's life. Buddy escapes from his alcoholic and aggressive owner and finds a peaceful life with Josh. On the other hand, Josh gets over depression and shyness thanks to Buddy, which gives the him will to live and brings back Josh's lost interest in basketball. That's when the movie's most original thing happens: Buddy can play basketball! That is just amazing! Like everybody else in the movie, to see the dog playing basketball leaves me speechless. That dog has an incredible talent for basketball and even more unbelievable is that he never fails. He's a much better and natural-born player than the humans themselves. He becomes the mascot of Josh's basketball team... which brings them lots of luck. The beauty of this movie isn't just in the dramatic story, but also in the friendship between Josh and man's best friend. Plus, Buddy is a Golden Retriever, my favorite dog breed. Golden Retrievers look so friendly and pacific. They are in fact. They are among the world's sweetest and most beautiful dogs. But the magnificent scenario also gives beauty to the movie: rivers, green places, a nice village. All of this is very well combined with soft, relaxing and beautiful piano music (like in "Fluke"). Tom is an eccentric boy who always carries minor pieces of garbage to give him luck. It is, however, a bit disturbing to see that Joe coach throwing him numerous basketballs, causing the boy to shake nervously and feel very tired. Larry, although constantly picking on Josh, isn't really annoying or stupid. He is more of an arrogant and jealous guy than actually mean. Despite having some deeply touching moments, the most heartbreaking moment of the movie is when Buddy crosses the river and tries to follow the river boat which Josh catches. That scene always makes tears come to my eyes. As for the cast, Kevin Zegers (a sports boy in real life, just like Noah Hathaway) is wonderful in the role of Josh Framm and Buddy the Dog is simply fantastic as Buddy. I was so sad when I found out that Buddy died. He was a friendly, adorable, beautiful and very talented dog. The little girl who plays Josh's cute little sister (whoever she is) is alright either. But I don't like some of the characters at all. Norm Snively is a drunk, abusive man and a loser as a clown. Coach Joe is a jerk and unkind. Larry's father is a jerk and a hypocrite. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    I really enjoyed this movie, as an owner now of 4 dogs, and as a kid when I had a dog ,, I used to share lunch with the dog,, talk to him/her... play all the things kids do with dogs.. this movie just rocks.. I so hated buddy's first owner,, the stupid clown,, oh so happy when the kid decides to take action against the clown. as far as a dog playing basketball I actually wouldn't put it past an actual real life dog to do it being properly trained and all, the only thing I feel that's a little far fetched is the poor dog wearing those tiny dog slippers tell me how a golden retriever is gonna run up and down the basketball court in sneakers,, but other than that I really just loved this movie,, it's a movie for all ages 9-99. enjoy folks.

    The first of the 'Air Bud' series is as much wonderful as it is horribly underrated, truly a 90's classic. It has a dignified place in the list of the greatest animal movies as well. In many ways it is a depressing movie but it's also heart-warming, touching, feel-good and tons of fun. There's more to it to like, though. Cinematography is really beautiful and pure. The soundtrack is just perfect for this film. The boy and his devoted four-legged friend make a marvelous team and have a perfect chemistry. Even though the film's title obviously refers to the dog, his name is actually Buddy - that is, once he ends up in the hands of Josh Framm. Even as the movie starts, the little we see is enough to realize how horribly the clown treats his dog (constantly yelling at him and hitting him hard with the newspaper). It is heartbreaking to see that. Fortunately, this horrible man accidentally loses him and he finds Josh Framm (a, I assume, 12-year-old who is loving and caring but very shy and silent and currently under a depressive mood). They quickly become best friends, as Josh gives him the treatment he deserves. Buddy is a very special dog alone, but he has a special secret that makes him even more special: he can play basketball (even more amazing, better than humans can!). Even though the clown is a horrible person, he doesn't have that much of a role. He is not someone I sympathize and he certainly isn't funny, although it is hilarious when his truck starts to fall apart and he can't stop it and accidentally drives it into the river. Larry Willingham's father is a jerk. Even though Larry unfairly picks on Josh, at least he isn't too bratty and is funny at times. But Larry's father, that guy is such a jerk, although not overly annoying. Coach Joe isn't especially sympathetic because he is very impatient and temperamental, but he goes too far when he throws basketballs at Josh's peculiar friend Tom with aggressiveness. The movie is focused more on Josh and Buddy, who are the most likable characters of the movie. Kevin Zegers is flawless as Josh Framm. Buddy the Dog is amazing as Buddy (may this wonderful dog rest in peace, wherever he is now). Brendan Fletcher does a good job as Larry. So does Shayn Solberg as Josh's good friend Tom. The late Eric Christmas is hilarious as Judge Cranfield. Title in Portugal: 'Air Bud'.

    Looking for a great sports movie with touching scenes and some unique players? Well then this is a movie for you. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Julianna No one (age 12) shares her review below: Video review available here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FORlwS-_E This movie stars Kevin Zeggers as Josh Framm, Wendy Makkena as Jackie Framm, and Michael Jeter as Norm Snively the clown. This film is about a boy who is new to town. One day while playing basketball Josh finds Bud, a abandoned dog. Bud gives Josh faith in himself which leads him to try out for the basketball team. Josh learns that Bud can play basketball too. Josh and Bud just have to be aware of Bud's old abusive owner, Norm Snively the clown. My favorite character is Bud. I like Bud because of his unbiased love of Josh and because Josh and his family took Bud in when his old abusive owner was about to take him to the pound. However, I like him mostly because he is talented and it is pretty cool that he can play basketball. My favorite scenes are when Bud decides to bite his old owner Norm the clown and runs back to his new family, Josh and the rest of the Framms. My other favorite scene is when Bud actually plays for Josh's team because one player is injured and another fouls out of the game. What I like about this movie is how well the stunt coordinator trained Bud, so in the movie he has such great aptitude or talent. The cinematography is well done and how it is anthropomorphic in how Bud is able to play basketball, like he is just another kid on the team. I think that people who love animals, sports and comedy mixed with a little heart warming scenes will absolutely love this incredible film. I know this because I really love this film and I hope you will as well. Also even if you don't really like sports or animal movies you will still enjoy this film as it has a great story to follow. This movie is great for the whole family. There is a strong moral to the story as well as many emotionally gripping scenes for everyone to enjoy. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars because it is a great movie that everyone can sit down and enjoy.

    (Some Spoilers) After being abandoned on the highway by his master the drunken clown Norm Snively played by Michael Jeter, no relations to Yankee star infielder Derek, Buddy the dog is befriended by young Josh Framm, Kevin Zegers, who found Buddy lost and hungry wandering around in the woods. Josh is having trouble adjusting to his new life in Fernfield Washington and Buddy is just what he needs, a friend, to spend his time with. As it soon turns out Buddy has this talent in shooting basketballs through hoops by bouncing them off his snout that can put Michael Jordon and Jerry West to shame! The film has Josh together with his dog Buddy become the sensation of Fernfield High School who do a half-time show that's draws more people them the basketball game itself. It's the teams new coach school janitor and boiler room attendant,it gets real cold up there in Washington State during the winter, former professional basketball player for the New York Knicks Arthur Chaney, Bill Cobbs,who sees potential in Buddy's,the team's mascot, ability to play on the team and waits just for the right moment to put him into the game. That comes at the critical game for the state championship honors between Coach Chaney's Timberwolves and last years champions Warriors! It's during this time that Buddy's former owner Snively, while recovering from the DT's, sees Buddy on the local TV news shooting baskets and a light bulb lights up in his head. Seeing dollar signs and six packs of beer in his future Snively decides to get Buddy back legally despite having abandoned him months ago. Something that both Buddy and his new found friend Josh will do everything in their power to prevent. Corny at times but heart warming film with the sharp shooting Buddy, who sadly passed away six months after the films release, making every basket count as well as stealing ever scene in the movie. Not only was Buddy able to score points but as Coach Chaney predicted motivate the players, especially Josh, to improve their game as well. While Snively tried to get Buddy back and make money with him by doing beer and dog food commercials the dog with Josh's help escaped and ended up in court in a dog custody case with Josh and Snively as the complainants. ***SPOILERS***Even though the presiding judge in the case Judge Cornfield, played by Eric Christmas,is a big Knick, as well as former Knick player Arthur Chaney, fan and was very sympathetic for Josh in seeing what a crazy nut, coming to court dressed up as Bozo the clown, Sinvely was it was in fact Buddy who made the decision to whom he want's to stay with. And as it turned out that decision was final!

Larry, although constantly picking on Josh, isn't really annoying or stupid. He is more of an arrogant and jealous guy than actually mean. Despite having some deeply touching moments, the most heartbreaking moment of the movie is when Buddy crosses the river and tries to follow the river boat which Josh catches. That scene always makes tears come to my eyes. As for the cast, Kevin Zegers (a sports boy in real life, just like Noah Hathaway) is wonderful in the role of Josh Framm and Buddy the Dog is simply fantastic as Buddy. I was so sad when I found out that Buddy died. He was a friendly, adorable, beautiful and very talented dog. The little girl who plays Josh's cute little sister (whoever she is) is alright either. But I don't like some of the characters at all. Norm Snively is a drunk, abusive man and a loser as a clown. Coach Joe is a jerk and unkind. Larry's father is a jerk and a hypocrite. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    I really enjoyed this movie, as an owner now of 4 dogs, and as a kid when I had a dog ,, I used to share lunch with the dog,, talk to him/her... play all the things kids do with dogs.. this movie just rocks.. I so hated buddy's first owner,, the stupid clown,, oh so happy when the kid decides to take action against the clown. as far as a dog playing basketball I actually wouldn't put it past an actual real life dog to do it being properly trained and all, the only thing I feel that's a little far fetched is the poor dog wearing those tiny dog slippers tell me how a golden retriever is gonna run up and down the basketball court in sneakers,, but other than that I really just loved this movie,, it's a movie for all ages 9-99. enjoy folks.

    The first of the 'Air Bud' series is as much wonderful as it is horribly underrated, truly a 90's classic. It has a dignified place in the list of the greatest animal movies as well. In many ways it is a depressing movie but it's also heart-warming, touching, feel-good and tons of fun. There's more to it to like, though. Cinematography is really beautiful and pure. The soundtrack is just perfect for this film. The boy and his devoted four-legged friend make a marvelous team and have a perfect chemistry. Even though the film's title obviously refers to the dog, his name is actually Buddy - that is, once he ends up in the hands of Josh Framm. Even as the movie starts, the little we see is enough to realize how horribly the clown treats his dog (constantly yelling at him and hitting him hard with the newspaper). It is heartbreaking to see that. Fortunately, this horrible man accidentally loses him and he finds Josh Framm (a, I assume, 12-year-old who is loving and caring but very shy and silent and currently under a depressive mood). They quickly become best friends, as Josh gives him the treatment he deserves. Buddy is a very special dog alone, but he has a special secret that makes him even more special: he can play basketball (even more amazing, better than humans can!). Even though the clown is a horrible person, he doesn't have that much of a role. He is not someone I sympathize and he certainly isn't funny, although it is hilarious when his truck starts to fall apart and he can't stop it and accidentally drives it into the river. Larry Willingham's father is a jerk. Even though Larry unfairly picks on Josh, at least he isn't too bratty and is funny at times. But Larry's father, that guy is such a jerk, although not overly annoying. Coach Joe isn't especially sympathetic because he is very impatient and temperamental, but he goes too far when he throws basketballs at Josh's peculiar friend Tom with aggressiveness. The movie is focused more on Josh and Buddy, who are the most likable characters of the movie. Kevin Zegers is flawless as Josh Framm. Buddy the Dog is amazing as Buddy (may this wonderful dog rest in peace, wherever he is now). Brendan Fletcher does a good job as Larry. So does Shayn Solberg as Josh's good friend Tom. The late Eric Christmas is hilarious as Judge Cranfield. Title in Portugal: 'Air Bud'.

    Looking for a great sports movie with touching scenes and some unique players? Well then this is a movie for you. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Julianna No one (age 12) shares her review below: Video review available here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FORlwS-_E This movie stars Kevin Zeggers as Josh Framm, Wendy Makkena as Jackie Framm, and Michael Jeter as Norm Snively the clown. This film is about a boy who is new to town. One day while playing basketball Josh finds Bud, a abandoned dog. Bud gives Josh faith in himself which leads him to try out for the basketball team. Josh learns that Bud can play basketball too. Josh and Bud just have to be aware of Bud's old abusive owner, Norm Snively the clown. My favorite character is Bud. I like Bud because of his unbiased love of Josh and because Josh and his family took Bud in when his old abusive owner was about to take him to the pound. However, I like him mostly because he is talented and it is pretty cool that he can play basketball. My favorite scenes are when Bud decides to bite his old owner Norm the clown and runs back to his new family, Josh and the rest of the Framms. My other favorite scene is when Bud actually plays for Josh's team because one player is injured and another fouls out of the game. What I like about this movie is how well the stunt coordinator trained Bud, so in the movie he has such great aptitude or talent. The cinematography is well done and how it is anthropomorphic in how Bud is able to play basketball, like he is just another kid on the team. I think that people who love animals, sports and comedy mixed with a little heart warming scenes will absolutely love this incredible film. I know this because I really love this film and I hope you will as well. Also even if you don't really like sports or animal movies you will still enjoy this film as it has a great story to follow. This movie is great for the whole family. There is a strong moral to the story as well as many emotionally gripping scenes for everyone to enjoy. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars because it is a great movie that everyone can sit down and enjoy.

    (Some Spoilers) After being abandoned on the highway by his master the drunken clown Norm Snively played by Michael Jeter, no relations to Yankee star infielder Derek, Buddy the dog is befriended by young Josh Framm, Kevin Zegers, who found Buddy lost and hungry wandering around in the woods. Josh is having trouble adjusting to his new life in Fernfield Washington and Buddy is just what he needs, a friend, to spend his time with. As it soon turns out Buddy has this talent in shooting basketballs through hoops by bouncing them off his snout that can put Michael Jordon and Jerry West to shame! The film has Josh together with his dog Buddy become the sensation of Fernfield High School who do a half-time show that's draws more people them the basketball game itself. It's the teams new coach school janitor and boiler room attendant,it gets real cold up there in Washington State during the winter, former professional basketball player for the New York Knicks Arthur Chaney, Bill Cobbs,who sees potential in Buddy's,the team's mascot, ability to play on the team and waits just for the right moment to put him into the game. That comes at the critical game for the state championship honors between Coach Chaney's Timberwolves and last years champions Warriors! It's during this time that Buddy's former owner Snively, while recovering from the DT's, sees Buddy on the local TV news shooting baskets and a light bulb lights up in his head. Seeing dollar signs and six packs of beer in his future Snively decides to get Buddy back legally despite having abandoned him months ago. Something that both Buddy and his new found friend Josh will do everything in their power to prevent. Corny at times but heart warming film with the sharp shooting Buddy, who sadly passed away six months after the films release, making every basket count as well as stealing ever scene in the movie. Not only was Buddy able to score points but as Coach Chaney predicted motivate the players, especially Josh, to improve their game as well. While Snively tried to get Buddy back and make money with him by doing beer and dog food commercials the dog with Josh's help escaped and ended up in court in a dog custody case with Josh and Snively as the complainants. ***SPOILERS***Even though the presiding judge in the case Judge Cornfield, played by Eric Christmas,is a big Knick, as well as former Knick player Arthur Chaney, fan and was very sympathetic for Josh in seeing what a crazy nut, coming to court dressed up as Bozo the clown, Sinvely was it was in fact Buddy who made the decision to whom he want's to stay with. And as it turned out that decision was final!

    I loved this movie when I was a kid, and even back then I had little idea why. I mean, it wasn't like I thought it was particularly funny or touching or anything like that. I guess I just really liked the basic premise, because you have to admit the central idea is pretty weird and nutty. How stoned do you have to get before you come up with a dog that plays basketball? How would that even remotely work? I'm really putting too much thought in this movie I guess, but it's just so bizarre that I've always found it very entertaining. I've learned the sequels actually stretch the premise even further and involve dogs that can play soccer, baseball and volleyball, but this one will always be the one and only original "dog does weird athletic stuff it can't possibly do"-flick.

    Air Bud is far from a classic, but I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. As far as dog movies go, Lassie Come Home and Old Yeller are the best in my opinion, but Air Bud is not a bad family movie at all. It is too short though, and there is some uneven direction and some hit and misses in the script, However, some of it is fitfully amusing, and the story is appealing. And the characters are engaging, especially Buddy and Josh, those two have great chemistry together. Kevin Zegers is likable enough, while Buddy steals the film whether it is the stunts or the bonding scenes. Air Bud is nice to look at, and the soundtrack is decent. But I have to give special mention to the acrobatics, because they are amazing. All in all, an entertaining and likable film, not perfect but decent family fare without taking itself too seriously. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    After a kids dad dies he moves to a new city where he finds himself lost and alone. His passion is basketball, but hes kind of shy and weird around kids and doesn't try out for the team at first. He finds a stray dog and soon learns the dog can actually shoot hoops with his nose. After a while he joins the team and soon the whole town witnesses the dogs talents and he ends up on the team. Soon, once the original owner of the dog who hated him finds out the dog is famous he comes back to claim him for his own. I had watched this movie a few times years ago and it was just another predictable happy ending kids film. I must admit there's hundreds of thousands of these movies made and they are all pretty much the same. Good for a kid to set down and kept shut up for an hour and a half. You know how they are gonna end and what the story is all about just by looking at the cover art. I didn't hate it, but it offered nothing great. I like Kevin Zegers and I had watched this a few times 12 or 13 years ago when it came out and thought it was okay for a kids movie. Eric Christmas does good as the judge and Michael Jeter plays a good bad guy here.. I always give credit to directors who work with animals, it cannot be an easy job. The director of this film made an old horror movie from 86 I love called Trick or Treat so thats a cool plus for me. Watch it and decide for yourself but you aren't seeing anything new here. Maybe a dog playing basketball isn't that heard of or seen, but it's not too impressive and the story itself is middle of the road 3/10 stars.

    Although this family sports movie was released in 1997, I believe I saw it for the first time in 2001. I was in my early teens at the time, and it definitely didn't turn out to be one of my all-time favourite movies, but I think I was impressed with a lot of it. I certainly wasn't bored. If I remember correctly, what I liked the most about "Air Bud" was the dog, since I found him so cute. I think he often put a smile on my face, at least early in the film. However, if I hadn't seen the film years ago, I doubt I would have ever bothered watching it, but since I remembered it, I decided to watch it again eight years later. This time, I knew it wasn't a very popular movie, and unsurprisingly, I noticed some flaws I hadn't noticed before. Josh Framm is a boy who has just moved to Fernfield, Washington with his mother and younger sister after the tragic death of his father. At school in this town, he has no friends, and despite his interest in basketball, he is too shy to try out for the school's team. He discovers an abandoned basketball court in the town, and starts shooting hoops there. He also meets a stray golden retriever in that area, one who was lost by his abusive owner, a clown named Norm Snively, when he fell out of his truck. Josh quickly befriends this dog, naming him Buddy, and sees that he's also good at basketball! Eventually, Josh does make the school team, and Buddy soon joins in, which brings him a lot of attention. Unfortunately, however, after Norm Snively sees his lost dog on TV, he wants him back. The relationship between the boy and the dog could be in trouble, and so could the team! This movie is hands down a failure when it comes to humour. This includes the beginning, with Norm Snively, played by Michael Jeter, at a birthday party with Buddy (before he loses him), trying to entertain a bunch of kids, which leads to some weak slapstick, making a huge mess in the house. The scene where Josh's mother sees Buddy for the first time is a lot like that, with more unfunny slapstick leading to a huge mess. Norm is supposed to be a really funny character, but VERY rarely is. As for the serious parts, they're not terrible, but aren't really that gripping or anything. A bit of emotion or tension wasn't enough to make it satisfying. Basically, "Air Bud" is another mediocre modern-day PG-rated kiddie flick, but I guess it's harmless, and many kids could enjoy it. As for me, I'm going to have to move on, and not bother watching this movie's one theatrical sequel or any of its many direct-to-video sequels.

    I am in disbelief right now, seeing all these horrible comments about a great family movie. I grew up loving all of the air bud movies, especially the first one. It really is a feel good movie, and I found it realistic. You have a young boy, who is struggling because of his fathers death, and he really does not have anything to look forward too. But when buddy comes into his life, everything changes. He is having a lot more fun, and you can see that throughout this movie. How can anyone say this is movie has no plot? The plot centers around a boy struggling, looking for something, and finds it in Buddy I know it is not real realistic for a dog to play basketball, but honestly, i could care less. This is a great family movie, one that i would recommend to anyone.

    'Air Bud' is one of "doggy" movies so much in fashion in its time. And it's surprisingly underrated. This is by no means a comedy, although it has its funny moments. It is dramatic, more than anything. In fact, this is often a depressing film but joyful at the same time. Unlike its sequels, this one has a clever plot (a sentimental one, I'd say). It's heartwarming, in the line of others like this such as 'Old Yeller', 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey', 'Napoleon' and 'Fluke'. Despite the title, the story isn't just about our very dear canine friend Buddy (even if he is the main star). The story also focus on Josh Framm, who is a crucial character, together with the dog. After all, they are destined to be best friends. Josh is Buddy's salvation, but Buddy also plays an important role to save Josh's life. Buddy escapes from his alcoholic and aggressive owner and finds a peaceful life with Josh. On the other hand, Josh gets over depression and shyness thanks to Buddy, which gives the him will to live and brings back Josh's lost interest in basketball. That's when the movie's most original thing happens: Buddy can play basketball! That is just amazing! Like everybody else in the movie, to see the dog playing basketball leaves me speechless. That dog has an incredible talent for basketball and even more unbelievable is that he never fails. He's a much better and natural-born player than the humans themselves. He becomes the mascot of Josh's basketball team... which brings them lots of luck. The beauty of this movie isn't just in the dramatic story, but also in the friendship between Josh and man's best friend. Plus, Buddy is a Golden Retriever, my favorite dog breed. Golden Retrievers look so friendly and pacific. They are in fact. They are among the world's sweetest and most beautiful dogs. But the magnificent scenario also gives beauty to the movie: rivers, green places, a nice village. All of this is very well combined with soft, relaxing and beautiful piano music (like in "Fluke"). Tom is an eccentric boy who always carries minor pieces of garbage to give him luck. It is, however, a bit disturbing to see that Joe coach throwing him numerous basketballs, causing the boy to shake nervously and feel very tired. Larry, although constantly picking on Josh, isn't really annoying or stupid. He is more of an arrogant and jealous guy than actually mean. Despite having some deeply touching moments, the most heartbreaking moment of the movie is when Buddy crosses the river and tries to follow the river boat which Josh catches. That scene always makes tears come to my eyes. As for the cast, Kevin Zegers (a sports boy in real life, just like Noah Hathaway) is wonderful in the role of Josh Framm and Buddy the Dog is simply fantastic as Buddy. I was so sad when I found out that Buddy died. He was a friendly, adorable, beautiful and very talented dog. The little girl who plays Josh's cute little sister (whoever she is) is alright either. But I don't like some of the characters at all. Norm Snively is a drunk, abusive man and a loser as a clown. Coach Joe is a jerk and unkind. Larry's father is a jerk and a hypocrite. This should definitely be on Top 250.
