    A morality story of distrust, savagery, and survival in the Mexican desert Three men roaming the world at loose ends hook up in Tampico, Mexico and band together to prospect for gold. We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument. Tim Holt plays the guy who has the physical and emotional advantages of youth on his side. Not yet beaten down by life into a fatalistic pessimism, he has an inner decency, and expectations; to him life is still a vista of possibilities. The threat of Mexican bandits lurks among the three prospectors as a constant threat. The banditos offer a hovering menace as well as a device for black humor. Actor Alfonso Bedoya, the head bad guy, utters a few lines of dialogue that still resonate today. When challenged he voices a self-proclaimed authority that needs no official validation. He doesn't "need no stinking badges!" A story of desperation, greed, and of how fate that unpredictable determinator inserts itself into events to throw a wrench in the works, turning the best laid plans of men into just dust blowing in the desert wind.

    Τhe theme of this film is about a treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains. It's a classic movie with action and adventure. The direction of this movie for the time that it was filmed (1948) is very good and that's why John Huston won the academy award of Best Director. I also liked the performances of Humphrey Bogart (Dobbs) as one of the American who searches for work in Mexico but can not find so he is going to find the treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains, and the performance of Tim Holt (Curtin) as one of the partners of Humphrey Bogart. In this movie you will see how the reactions of a person changes when money are the most important thing of the people and you will understand how the situation changes because of them.

    One of the first-rate westerns as well as one of the finest films ever made, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superbly directed, adapted and acted cinema that even after a span of more than 6 decades hasn't aged a day. Featuring 3 brilliant performances from Humphrey Bogart, Walter Hudson & Tim Holt that alone elevated this film to an instant classic status, while also presenting a very gripping story of treasure hunting blended with the themes of friendship, doubt, greed & fate, the movie is tightly edited and creates an excellent atmosphere of doubt & suspense throughout its runtime and culminates with an unexpected but if seen from a different paradigm, a truly fitting finale. Beautifully portraying the corrupting power of greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a must for every cinema lover.

    The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully. And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie. Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade. Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too. Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico. Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clich&eacute;s, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work. I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.

    I realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed "corny", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven. One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious. I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic. There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched. There are just so many things about the man that ooze a particular essence, and it's no wonder the man had a great career. 3) John Huston will always be remembered as one of the best filmmakers there ever was. His grandiose stories were full of human qualities, full of great dialogue and wonderful sceneries captured perfectly by the director. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those movies that tells a tale of a most important theme in history: greed. One of the reasons this film gets a 10 out of 10 for me is because it is endures; I only recently saw this for the first time after having heard Paul Thomas Anderson talk of it a bunch, and boy have I been sleeping. I had already fell in love with Bogart's acting previously via In a Lonely Place, and started my way on watching through his other performances. Here, Bogart plays the dirtiest dirt bag I've ever seen on film: the poor American starting off with most honourable intentions devolves into a paranoid, revolting, seething maniac bent on doing anyone in if they even so much as look at him with a queer eye. Admittedly, I have never seen Tim Holt in anything, but I loved his portrayal of Curtin; the almost baby faced hopeful prospector comes out to be the more honourable of the two between he and Bogart's Dobbs. However, the picture stealing role in this film goes to Walter Huston (father of the director John Huston) who absolutely tears through his character of Howard: an old seasoned prospector who takes Curtin and Dobbs up to mine for gold, and shows them how to get along while prospecting while providing some hearty laughs for the audience. There are a few times I found myself laughing just as much as Howard himself, which I don't often do aloud by myself while watching films (even comedies); later on, this compliments the film itself, as laughter is a cathartic action for Curtin and Howard in the end. From the cinematography to the writing to the acting and overall direction of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, everything lines up perfect. An epic (I hate the overuse today of that word, but here it is truly deserved in the classical sense) tale of greed, honour, and pure evil, which could be placed today in the current state of the oil business; Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood bridges this film to the audiences of today who are more akin to the oil industry than that of gold. Once again, that is a reason why this film holds up today because the themes here are the same ones running through the veins of society these days. In the end, two of the characters learn a highly valuable lesson that there are worse things than the loss of wealth. 10 out of 10 and HIGHLY recommended for any true lover of cinema. "We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds."

    The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a reflection on some of the most basic human values. Greed for money, trust in friends, courage and loyalty, always helping the needy are some of themes that manifest themselves on the screen during different times. The acting is brilliant in this movie. Humphrey Bogart is spot on with his portrayal of an impecunious bloke, who wants an opportunity to make it big, and his transformation from that to a mistrusting, nefarious lunatic. Tim Holt and Walter Huston complement Bogart wonderfully and act as models of rectitude and self-righteousness. The bandits and the Indians put in captivating performances. The scene at the end ,when Holt and Huston's characters laugh at the game fate put them through just to set them off to the next chapters in their life where they can feel contented, served as a fitting end to an impressive movie by John Huston.

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

    THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all. But it was. THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich. Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed. THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance. Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene. The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him. If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    Τhe theme of this film is about a treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains. It's a classic movie with action and adventure. The direction of this movie for the time that it was filmed (1948) is very good and that's why John Huston won the academy award of Best Director. I also liked the performances of Humphrey Bogart (Dobbs) as one of the American who searches for work in Mexico but can not find so he is going to find the treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains, and the performance of Tim Holt (Curtin) as one of the partners of Humphrey Bogart. In this movie you will see how the reactions of a person changes when money are the most important thing of the people and you will understand how the situation changes because of them.

    One of the first-rate westerns as well as one of the finest films ever made, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superbly directed, adapted and acted cinema that even after a span of more than 6 decades hasn't aged a day. Featuring 3 brilliant performances from Humphrey Bogart, Walter Hudson & Tim Holt that alone elevated this film to an instant classic status, while also presenting a very gripping story of treasure hunting blended with the themes of friendship, doubt, greed & fate, the movie is tightly edited and creates an excellent atmosphere of doubt & suspense throughout its runtime and culminates with an unexpected but if seen from a different paradigm, a truly fitting finale. Beautifully portraying the corrupting power of greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a must for every cinema lover.

    The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully. And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie. Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade. Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too. Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico. Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clich&eacute;s, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work. I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.

    I realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed "corny", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven. One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious. I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic. There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched. There are just so many things about the man that ooze a particular essence, and it's no wonder the man had a great career. 3) John Huston will always be remembered as one of the best filmmakers there ever was. His grandiose stories were full of human qualities, full of great dialogue and wonderful sceneries captured perfectly by the director. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those movies that tells a tale of a most important theme in history: greed. One of the reasons this film gets a 10 out of 10 for me is because it is endures; I only recently saw this for the first time after having heard Paul Thomas Anderson talk of it a bunch, and boy have I been sleeping. I had already fell in love with Bogart's acting previously via In a Lonely Place, and started my way on watching through his other performances. Here, Bogart plays the dirtiest dirt bag I've ever seen on film: the poor American starting off with most honourable intentions devolves into a paranoid, revolting, seething maniac bent on doing anyone in if they even so much as look at him with a queer eye. Admittedly, I have never seen Tim Holt in anything, but I loved his portrayal of Curtin; the almost baby faced hopeful prospector comes out to be the more honourable of the two between he and Bogart's Dobbs. However, the picture stealing role in this film goes to Walter Huston (father of the director John Huston) who absolutely tears through his character of Howard: an old seasoned prospector who takes Curtin and Dobbs up to mine for gold, and shows them how to get along while prospecting while providing some hearty laughs for the audience. There are a few times I found myself laughing just as much as Howard himself, which I don't often do aloud by myself while watching films (even comedies); later on, this compliments the film itself, as laughter is a cathartic action for Curtin and Howard in the end. From the cinematography to the writing to the acting and overall direction of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, everything lines up perfect. An epic (I hate the overuse today of that word, but here it is truly deserved in the classical sense) tale of greed, honour, and pure evil, which could be placed today in the current state of the oil business; Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood bridges this film to the audiences of today who are more akin to the oil industry than that of gold. Once again, that is a reason why this film holds up today because the themes here are the same ones running through the veins of society these days. In the end, two of the characters learn a highly valuable lesson that there are worse things than the loss of wealth. 10 out of 10 and HIGHLY recommended for any true lover of cinema. "We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds."

    The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a reflection on some of the most basic human values. Greed for money, trust in friends, courage and loyalty, always helping the needy are some of themes that manifest themselves on the screen during different times. The acting is brilliant in this movie. Humphrey Bogart is spot on with his portrayal of an impecunious bloke, who wants an opportunity to make it big, and his transformation from that to a mistrusting, nefarious lunatic. Tim Holt and Walter Huston complement Bogart wonderfully and act as models of rectitude and self-righteousness. The bandits and the Indians put in captivating performances. The scene at the end ,when Holt and Huston's characters laugh at the game fate put them through just to set them off to the next chapters in their life where they can feel contented, served as a fitting end to an impressive movie by John Huston.

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

    THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all. But it was. THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich. Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed. THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance. Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene. The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him. If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    A morality story of distrust, savagery, and survival in the Mexican desert Three men roaming the world at loose ends hook up in Tampico, Mexico and band together to prospect for gold. We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument. Tim Holt plays the guy who has the physical and emotional advantages of youth on his side. Not yet beaten down by life into a fatalistic pessimism, he has an inner decency, and expectations; to him life is still a vista of possibilities. The threat of Mexican bandits lurks among the three prospectors as a constant threat. The banditos offer a hovering menace as well as a device for black humor. Actor Alfonso Bedoya, the head bad guy, utters a few lines of dialogue that still resonate today. When challenged he voices a self-proclaimed authority that needs no official validation. He doesn't "need no stinking badges!" A story of desperation, greed, and of how fate that unpredictable determinator inserts itself into events to throw a wrench in the works, turning the best laid plans of men into just dust blowing in the desert wind.

But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious. I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic. There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched. There are just so many things about the man that ooze a particular essence, and it's no wonder the man had a great career. 3) John Huston will always be remembered as one of the best filmmakers there ever was. His grandiose stories were full of human qualities, full of great dialogue and wonderful sceneries captured perfectly by the director. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those movies that tells a tale of a most important theme in history: greed. One of the reasons this film gets a 10 out of 10 for me is because it is endures; I only recently saw this for the first time after having heard Paul Thomas Anderson talk of it a bunch, and boy have I been sleeping. I had already fell in love with Bogart's acting previously via In a Lonely Place, and started my way on watching through his other performances. Here, Bogart plays the dirtiest dirt bag I've ever seen on film: the poor American starting off with most honourable intentions devolves into a paranoid, revolting, seething maniac bent on doing anyone in if they even so much as look at him with a queer eye. Admittedly, I have never seen Tim Holt in anything, but I loved his portrayal of Curtin; the almost baby faced hopeful prospector comes out to be the more honourable of the two between he and Bogart's Dobbs. However, the picture stealing role in this film goes to Walter Huston (father of the director John Huston) who absolutely tears through his character of Howard: an old seasoned prospector who takes Curtin and Dobbs up to mine for gold, and shows them how to get along while prospecting while providing some hearty laughs for the audience. There are a few times I found myself laughing just as much as Howard himself, which I don't often do aloud by myself while watching films (even comedies); later on, this compliments the film itself, as laughter is a cathartic action for Curtin and Howard in the end. From the cinematography to the writing to the acting and overall direction of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, everything lines up perfect. An epic (I hate the overuse today of that word, but here it is truly deserved in the classical sense) tale of greed, honour, and pure evil, which could be placed today in the current state of the oil business; Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood bridges this film to the audiences of today who are more akin to the oil industry than that of gold. Once again, that is a reason why this film holds up today because the themes here are the same ones running through the veins of society these days. In the end, two of the characters learn a highly valuable lesson that there are worse things than the loss of wealth. 10 out of 10 and HIGHLY recommended for any true lover of cinema. "We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds."

    The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a reflection on some of the most basic human values. Greed for money, trust in friends, courage and loyalty, always helping the needy are some of themes that manifest themselves on the screen during different times. The acting is brilliant in this movie. Humphrey Bogart is spot on with his portrayal of an impecunious bloke, who wants an opportunity to make it big, and his transformation from that to a mistrusting, nefarious lunatic. Tim Holt and Walter Huston complement Bogart wonderfully and act as models of rectitude and self-righteousness. The bandits and the Indians put in captivating performances. The scene at the end ,when Holt and Huston's characters laugh at the game fate put them through just to set them off to the next chapters in their life where they can feel contented, served as a fitting end to an impressive movie by John Huston.

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

    THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all. But it was. THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich. Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed. THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance. Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene. The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him. If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    A morality story of distrust, savagery, and survival in the Mexican desert Three men roaming the world at loose ends hook up in Tampico, Mexico and band together to prospect for gold. We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument. Tim Holt plays the guy who has the physical and emotional advantages of youth on his side. Not yet beaten down by life into a fatalistic pessimism, he has an inner decency, and expectations; to him life is still a vista of possibilities. The threat of Mexican bandits lurks among the three prospectors as a constant threat. The banditos offer a hovering menace as well as a device for black humor. Actor Alfonso Bedoya, the head bad guy, utters a few lines of dialogue that still resonate today. When challenged he voices a self-proclaimed authority that needs no official validation. He doesn't "need no stinking badges!" A story of desperation, greed, and of how fate that unpredictable determinator inserts itself into events to throw a wrench in the works, turning the best laid plans of men into just dust blowing in the desert wind.

    Τhe theme of this film is about a treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains. It's a classic movie with action and adventure. The direction of this movie for the time that it was filmed (1948) is very good and that's why John Huston won the academy award of Best Director. I also liked the performances of Humphrey Bogart (Dobbs) as one of the American who searches for work in Mexico but can not find so he is going to find the treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains, and the performance of Tim Holt (Curtin) as one of the partners of Humphrey Bogart. In this movie you will see how the reactions of a person changes when money are the most important thing of the people and you will understand how the situation changes because of them.

    One of the first-rate westerns as well as one of the finest films ever made, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superbly directed, adapted and acted cinema that even after a span of more than 6 decades hasn't aged a day. Featuring 3 brilliant performances from Humphrey Bogart, Walter Hudson & Tim Holt that alone elevated this film to an instant classic status, while also presenting a very gripping story of treasure hunting blended with the themes of friendship, doubt, greed & fate, the movie is tightly edited and creates an excellent atmosphere of doubt & suspense throughout its runtime and culminates with an unexpected but if seen from a different paradigm, a truly fitting finale. Beautifully portraying the corrupting power of greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a must for every cinema lover.

    The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully. And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie. Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade. Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too. Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico. Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clich&eacute;s, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work. I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.

    I realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed "corny", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven. One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious. I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic. There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a reflection on some of the most basic human values. Greed for money, trust in friends, courage and loyalty, always helping the needy are some of themes that manifest themselves on the screen during different times. The acting is brilliant in this movie. Humphrey Bogart is spot on with his portrayal of an impecunious bloke, who wants an opportunity to make it big, and his transformation from that to a mistrusting, nefarious lunatic. Tim Holt and Walter Huston complement Bogart wonderfully and act as models of rectitude and self-righteousness. The bandits and the Indians put in captivating performances. The scene at the end ,when Holt and Huston's characters laugh at the game fate put them through just to set them off to the next chapters in their life where they can feel contented, served as a fitting end to an impressive movie by John Huston.

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

    THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all. But it was. THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich. Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed. THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance. Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene. The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him. If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    A morality story of distrust, savagery, and survival in the Mexican desert Three men roaming the world at loose ends hook up in Tampico, Mexico and band together to prospect for gold. We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument. Tim Holt plays the guy who has the physical and emotional advantages of youth on his side. Not yet beaten down by life into a fatalistic pessimism, he has an inner decency, and expectations; to him life is still a vista of possibilities. The threat of Mexican bandits lurks among the three prospectors as a constant threat. The banditos offer a hovering menace as well as a device for black humor. Actor Alfonso Bedoya, the head bad guy, utters a few lines of dialogue that still resonate today. When challenged he voices a self-proclaimed authority that needs no official validation. He doesn't "need no stinking badges!" A story of desperation, greed, and of how fate that unpredictable determinator inserts itself into events to throw a wrench in the works, turning the best laid plans of men into just dust blowing in the desert wind.

    Τhe theme of this film is about a treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains. It's a classic movie with action and adventure. The direction of this movie for the time that it was filmed (1948) is very good and that's why John Huston won the academy award of Best Director. I also liked the performances of Humphrey Bogart (Dobbs) as one of the American who searches for work in Mexico but can not find so he is going to find the treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains, and the performance of Tim Holt (Curtin) as one of the partners of Humphrey Bogart. In this movie you will see how the reactions of a person changes when money are the most important thing of the people and you will understand how the situation changes because of them.

    One of the first-rate westerns as well as one of the finest films ever made, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superbly directed, adapted and acted cinema that even after a span of more than 6 decades hasn't aged a day. Featuring 3 brilliant performances from Humphrey Bogart, Walter Hudson & Tim Holt that alone elevated this film to an instant classic status, while also presenting a very gripping story of treasure hunting blended with the themes of friendship, doubt, greed & fate, the movie is tightly edited and creates an excellent atmosphere of doubt & suspense throughout its runtime and culminates with an unexpected but if seen from a different paradigm, a truly fitting finale. Beautifully portraying the corrupting power of greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a must for every cinema lover.

    The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully. And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie. Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade. Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too. Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico. Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clich&eacute;s, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work. I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.

    I realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed "corny", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven. One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious. I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic. There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched. There are just so many things about the man that ooze a particular essence, and it's no wonder the man had a great career. 3) John Huston will always be remembered as one of the best filmmakers there ever was. His grandiose stories were full of human qualities, full of great dialogue and wonderful sceneries captured perfectly by the director. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those movies that tells a tale of a most important theme in history: greed. One of the reasons this film gets a 10 out of 10 for me is because it is endures; I only recently saw this for the first time after having heard Paul Thomas Anderson talk of it a bunch, and boy have I been sleeping. I had already fell in love with Bogart's acting previously via In a Lonely Place, and started my way on watching through his other performances. Here, Bogart plays the dirtiest dirt bag I've ever seen on film: the poor American starting off with most honourable intentions devolves into a paranoid, revolting, seething maniac bent on doing anyone in if they even so much as look at him with a queer eye. Admittedly, I have never seen Tim Holt in anything, but I loved his portrayal of Curtin; the almost baby faced hopeful prospector comes out to be the more honourable of the two between he and Bogart's Dobbs. However, the picture stealing role in this film goes to Walter Huston (father of the director John Huston) who absolutely tears through his character of Howard: an old seasoned prospector who takes Curtin and Dobbs up to mine for gold, and shows them how to get along while prospecting while providing some hearty laughs for the audience. There are a few times I found myself laughing just as much as Howard himself, which I don't often do aloud by myself while watching films (even comedies); later on, this compliments the film itself, as laughter is a cathartic action for Curtin and Howard in the end. From the cinematography to the writing to the acting and overall direction of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, everything lines up perfect. An epic (I hate the overuse today of that word, but here it is truly deserved in the classical sense) tale of greed, honour, and pure evil, which could be placed today in the current state of the oil business; Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood bridges this film to the audiences of today who are more akin to the oil industry than that of gold. Once again, that is a reason why this film holds up today because the themes here are the same ones running through the veins of society these days. In the end, two of the characters learn a highly valuable lesson that there are worse things than the loss of wealth. 10 out of 10 and HIGHLY recommended for any true lover of cinema. "We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds."

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B.

While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C.

It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay.

The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character.

The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

    THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all. But it was. THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich. Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed. THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance. Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene. The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him. If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    A morality story of distrust, savagery, and survival in the Mexican desert Three men roaming the world at loose ends hook up in Tampico, Mexico and band together to prospect for gold. We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument. Tim Holt plays the guy who has the physical and emotional advantages of youth on his side. Not yet beaten down by life into a fatalistic pessimism, he has an inner decency, and expectations; to him life is still a vista of possibilities. The threat of Mexican bandits lurks among the three prospectors as a constant threat. The banditos offer a hovering menace as well as a device for black humor. Actor Alfonso Bedoya, the head bad guy, utters a few lines of dialogue that still resonate today. When challenged he voices a self-proclaimed authority that needs no official validation. He doesn't "need no stinking badges!" A story of desperation, greed, and of how fate that unpredictable determinator inserts itself into events to throw a wrench in the works, turning the best laid plans of men into just dust blowing in the desert wind.

    Τhe theme of this film is about a treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains. It's a classic movie with action and adventure. The direction of this movie for the time that it was filmed (1948) is very good and that's why John Huston won the academy award of Best Director. I also liked the performances of Humphrey Bogart (Dobbs) as one of the American who searches for work in Mexico but can not find so he is going to find the treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains, and the performance of Tim Holt (Curtin) as one of the partners of Humphrey Bogart. In this movie you will see how the reactions of a person changes when money are the most important thing of the people and you will understand how the situation changes because of them.

    One of the first-rate westerns as well as one of the finest films ever made, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superbly directed, adapted and acted cinema that even after a span of more than 6 decades hasn't aged a day. Featuring 3 brilliant performances from Humphrey Bogart, Walter Hudson & Tim Holt that alone elevated this film to an instant classic status, while also presenting a very gripping story of treasure hunting blended with the themes of friendship, doubt, greed & fate, the movie is tightly edited and creates an excellent atmosphere of doubt & suspense throughout its runtime and culminates with an unexpected but if seen from a different paradigm, a truly fitting finale. Beautifully portraying the corrupting power of greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a must for every cinema lover.

    The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully. And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie. Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade. Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too. Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico. Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clich&eacute;s, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work. I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.

    I realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed "corny", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven. One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious. I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic. There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched. There are just so many things about the man that ooze a particular essence, and it's no wonder the man had a great career. 3) John Huston will always be remembered as one of the best filmmakers there ever was. His grandiose stories were full of human qualities, full of great dialogue and wonderful sceneries captured perfectly by the director. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those movies that tells a tale of a most important theme in history: greed. One of the reasons this film gets a 10 out of 10 for me is because it is endures; I only recently saw this for the first time after having heard Paul Thomas Anderson talk of it a bunch, and boy have I been sleeping. I had already fell in love with Bogart's acting previously via In a Lonely Place, and started my way on watching through his other performances. Here, Bogart plays the dirtiest dirt bag I've ever seen on film: the poor American starting off with most honourable intentions devolves into a paranoid, revolting, seething maniac bent on doing anyone in if they even so much as look at him with a queer eye. Admittedly, I have never seen Tim Holt in anything, but I loved his portrayal of Curtin; the almost baby faced hopeful prospector comes out to be the more honourable of the two between he and Bogart's Dobbs. However, the picture stealing role in this film goes to Walter Huston (father of the director John Huston) who absolutely tears through his character of Howard: an old seasoned prospector who takes Curtin and Dobbs up to mine for gold, and shows them how to get along while prospecting while providing some hearty laughs for the audience. There are a few times I found myself laughing just as much as Howard himself, which I don't often do aloud by myself while watching films (even comedies); later on, this compliments the film itself, as laughter is a cathartic action for Curtin and Howard in the end. From the cinematography to the writing to the acting and overall direction of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, everything lines up perfect. An epic (I hate the overuse today of that word, but here it is truly deserved in the classical sense) tale of greed, honour, and pure evil, which could be placed today in the current state of the oil business; Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood bridges this film to the audiences of today who are more akin to the oil industry than that of gold. Once again, that is a reason why this film holds up today because the themes here are the same ones running through the veins of society these days. In the end, two of the characters learn a highly valuable lesson that there are worse things than the loss of wealth. 10 out of 10 and HIGHLY recommended for any true lover of cinema. "We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds."

    The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a reflection on some of the most basic human values. Greed for money, trust in friends, courage and loyalty, always helping the needy are some of themes that manifest themselves on the screen during different times. The acting is brilliant in this movie. Humphrey Bogart is spot on with his portrayal of an impecunious bloke, who wants an opportunity to make it big, and his transformation from that to a mistrusting, nefarious lunatic. Tim Holt and Walter Huston complement Bogart wonderfully and act as models of rectitude and self-righteousness. The bandits and the Indians put in captivating performances. The scene at the end ,when Holt and Huston's characters laugh at the game fate put them through just to set them off to the next chapters in their life where they can feel contented, served as a fitting end to an impressive movie by John Huston.

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    A morality story of distrust, savagery, and survival in the Mexican desert Three men roaming the world at loose ends hook up in Tampico, Mexico and band together to prospect for gold. We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument. Tim Holt plays the guy who has the physical and emotional advantages of youth on his side. Not yet beaten down by life into a fatalistic pessimism, he has an inner decency, and expectations; to him life is still a vista of possibilities. The threat of Mexican bandits lurks among the three prospectors as a constant threat. The banditos offer a hovering menace as well as a device for black humor. Actor Alfonso Bedoya, the head bad guy, utters a few lines of dialogue that still resonate today. When challenged he voices a self-proclaimed authority that needs no official validation. He doesn't "need no stinking badges!" A story of desperation, greed, and of how fate that unpredictable determinator inserts itself into events to throw a wrench in the works, turning the best laid plans of men into just dust blowing in the desert wind.

    Τhe theme of this film is about a treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains. It's a classic movie with action and adventure. The direction of this movie for the time that it was filmed (1948) is very good and that's why John Huston won the academy award of Best Director. I also liked the performances of Humphrey Bogart (Dobbs) as one of the American who searches for work in Mexico but can not find so he is going to find the treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains, and the performance of Tim Holt (Curtin) as one of the partners of Humphrey Bogart. In this movie you will see how the reactions of a person changes when money are the most important thing of the people and you will understand how the situation changes because of them.

    One of the first-rate westerns as well as one of the finest films ever made, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superbly directed, adapted and acted cinema that even after a span of more than 6 decades hasn't aged a day. Featuring 3 brilliant performances from Humphrey Bogart, Walter Hudson & Tim Holt that alone elevated this film to an instant classic status, while also presenting a very gripping story of treasure hunting blended with the themes of friendship, doubt, greed & fate, the movie is tightly edited and creates an excellent atmosphere of doubt & suspense throughout its runtime and culminates with an unexpected but if seen from a different paradigm, a truly fitting finale. Beautifully portraying the corrupting power of greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a must for every cinema lover.

    The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully. And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie. Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade. Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too. Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico. Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clich&eacute;s, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work. I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.

    I realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed "corny", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven. One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious. I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic. There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched. There are just so many things about the man that ooze a particular essence, and it's no wonder the man had a great career. 3) John Huston will always be remembered as one of the best filmmakers there ever was. His grandiose stories were full of human qualities, full of great dialogue and wonderful sceneries captured perfectly by the director. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those movies that tells a tale of a most important theme in history: greed. One of the reasons this film gets a 10 out of 10 for me is because it is endures; I only recently saw this for the first time after having heard Paul Thomas Anderson talk of it a bunch, and boy have I been sleeping. I had already fell in love with Bogart's acting previously via In a Lonely Place, and started my way on watching through his other performances. Here, Bogart plays the dirtiest dirt bag I've ever seen on film: the poor American starting off with most honourable intentions devolves into a paranoid, revolting, seething maniac bent on doing anyone in if they even so much as look at him with a queer eye. Admittedly, I have never seen Tim Holt in anything, but I loved his portrayal of Curtin; the almost baby faced hopeful prospector comes out to be the more honourable of the two between he and Bogart's Dobbs. However, the picture stealing role in this film goes to Walter Huston (father of the director John Huston) who absolutely tears through his character of Howard: an old seasoned prospector who takes Curtin and Dobbs up to mine for gold, and shows them how to get along while prospecting while providing some hearty laughs for the audience. There are a few times I found myself laughing just as much as Howard himself, which I don't often do aloud by myself while watching films (even comedies); later on, this compliments the film itself, as laughter is a cathartic action for Curtin and Howard in the end. From the cinematography to the writing to the acting and overall direction of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, everything lines up perfect. An epic (I hate the overuse today of that word, but here it is truly deserved in the classical sense) tale of greed, honour, and pure evil, which could be placed today in the current state of the oil business; Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood bridges this film to the audiences of today who are more akin to the oil industry than that of gold. Once again, that is a reason why this film holds up today because the themes here are the same ones running through the veins of society these days. In the end, two of the characters learn a highly valuable lesson that there are worse things than the loss of wealth. 10 out of 10 and HIGHLY recommended for any true lover of cinema. "We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds."

    The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a reflection on some of the most basic human values. Greed for money, trust in friends, courage and loyalty, always helping the needy are some of themes that manifest themselves on the screen during different times. The acting is brilliant in this movie. Humphrey Bogart is spot on with his portrayal of an impecunious bloke, who wants an opportunity to make it big, and his transformation from that to a mistrusting, nefarious lunatic. Tim Holt and Walter Huston complement Bogart wonderfully and act as models of rectitude and self-righteousness. The bandits and the Indians put in captivating performances. The scene at the end ,when Holt and Huston's characters laugh at the game fate put them through just to set them off to the next chapters in their life where they can feel contented, served as a fitting end to an impressive movie by John Huston.

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

    THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all. But it was. THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich. Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed. THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance. Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene. The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him. If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption.

The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument.

    One of the first-rate westerns as well as one of the finest films ever made, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superbly directed, adapted and acted cinema that even after a span of more than 6 decades hasn't aged a day. Featuring 3 brilliant performances from Humphrey Bogart, Walter Hudson & Tim Holt that alone elevated this film to an instant classic status, while also presenting a very gripping story of treasure hunting blended with the themes of friendship, doubt, greed & fate, the movie is tightly edited and creates an excellent atmosphere of doubt & suspense throughout its runtime and culminates with an unexpected but if seen from a different paradigm, a truly fitting finale. Beautifully portraying the corrupting power of greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a must for every cinema lover.

    The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully. And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie. Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade. Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too. Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico. Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clich&eacute;s, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work. I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.

    I realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed "corny", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven. One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious. I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic. There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched. There are just so many things about the man that ooze a particular essence, and it's no wonder the man had a great career. 3) John Huston will always be remembered as one of the best filmmakers there ever was. His grandiose stories were full of human qualities, full of great dialogue and wonderful sceneries captured perfectly by the director. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those movies that tells a tale of a most important theme in history: greed. One of the reasons this film gets a 10 out of 10 for me is because it is endures; I only recently saw this for the first time after having heard Paul Thomas Anderson talk of it a bunch, and boy have I been sleeping. I had already fell in love with Bogart's acting previously via In a Lonely Place, and started my way on watching through his other performances. Here, Bogart plays the dirtiest dirt bag I've ever seen on film: the poor American starting off with most honourable intentions devolves into a paranoid, revolting, seething maniac bent on doing anyone in if they even so much as look at him with a queer eye. Admittedly, I have never seen Tim Holt in anything, but I loved his portrayal of Curtin; the almost baby faced hopeful prospector comes out to be the more honourable of the two between he and Bogart's Dobbs. However, the picture stealing role in this film goes to Walter Huston (father of the director John Huston) who absolutely tears through his character of Howard: an old seasoned prospector who takes Curtin and Dobbs up to mine for gold, and shows them how to get along while prospecting while providing some hearty laughs for the audience. There are a few times I found myself laughing just as much as Howard himself, which I don't often do aloud by myself while watching films (even comedies); later on, this compliments the film itself, as laughter is a cathartic action for Curtin and Howard in the end. From the cinematography to the writing to the acting and overall direction of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, everything lines up perfect. An epic (I hate the overuse today of that word, but here it is truly deserved in the classical sense) tale of greed, honour, and pure evil, which could be placed today in the current state of the oil business; Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood bridges this film to the audiences of today who are more akin to the oil industry than that of gold. Once again, that is a reason why this film holds up today because the themes here are the same ones running through the veins of society these days. In the end, two of the characters learn a highly valuable lesson that there are worse things than the loss of wealth. 10 out of 10 and HIGHLY recommended for any true lover of cinema. "We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds."

    The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a reflection on some of the most basic human values. Greed for money, trust in friends, courage and loyalty, always helping the needy are some of themes that manifest themselves on the screen during different times. The acting is brilliant in this movie. Humphrey Bogart is spot on with his portrayal of an impecunious bloke, who wants an opportunity to make it big, and his transformation from that to a mistrusting, nefarious lunatic. Tim Holt and Walter Huston complement Bogart wonderfully and act as models of rectitude and self-righteousness. The bandits and the Indians put in captivating performances. The scene at the end ,when Holt and Huston's characters laugh at the game fate put them through just to set them off to the next chapters in their life where they can feel contented, served as a fitting end to an impressive movie by John Huston.

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

    THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all. But it was. THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich. Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed. THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance. Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene. The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him. If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    A morality story of distrust, savagery, and survival in the Mexican desert Three men roaming the world at loose ends hook up in Tampico, Mexico and band together to prospect for gold. We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument. Tim Holt plays the guy who has the physical and emotional advantages of youth on his side. Not yet beaten down by life into a fatalistic pessimism, he has an inner decency, and expectations; to him life is still a vista of possibilities. The threat of Mexican bandits lurks among the three prospectors as a constant threat. The banditos offer a hovering menace as well as a device for black humor. Actor Alfonso Bedoya, the head bad guy, utters a few lines of dialogue that still resonate today. When challenged he voices a self-proclaimed authority that needs no official validation. He doesn't "need no stinking badges!" A story of desperation, greed, and of how fate that unpredictable determinator inserts itself into events to throw a wrench in the works, turning the best laid plans of men into just dust blowing in the desert wind.

    Τhe theme of this film is about a treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains. It's a classic movie with action and adventure. The direction of this movie for the time that it was filmed (1948) is very good and that's why John Huston won the academy award of Best Director. I also liked the performances of Humphrey Bogart (Dobbs) as one of the American who searches for work in Mexico but can not find so he is going to find the treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains, and the performance of Tim Holt (Curtin) as one of the partners of Humphrey Bogart. In this movie you will see how the reactions of a person changes when money are the most important thing of the people and you will understand how the situation changes because of them.

There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched. There are just so many things about the man that ooze a particular essence, and it's no wonder the man had a great career. 3) John Huston will always be remembered as one of the best filmmakers there ever was. His grandiose stories were full of human qualities, full of great dialogue and wonderful sceneries captured perfectly by the director. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of those movies that tells a tale of a most important theme in history: greed. One of the reasons this film gets a 10 out of 10 for me is because it is endures; I only recently saw this for the first time after having heard Paul Thomas Anderson talk of it a bunch, and boy have I been sleeping. I had already fell in love with Bogart's acting previously via In a Lonely Place, and started my way on watching through his other performances. Here, Bogart plays the dirtiest dirt bag I've ever seen on film: the poor American starting off with most honourable intentions devolves into a paranoid, revolting, seething maniac bent on doing anyone in if they even so much as look at him with a queer eye. Admittedly, I have never seen Tim Holt in anything, but I loved his portrayal of Curtin; the almost baby faced hopeful prospector comes out to be the more honourable of the two between he and Bogart's Dobbs. However, the picture stealing role in this film goes to Walter Huston (father of the director John Huston) who absolutely tears through his character of Howard: an old seasoned prospector who takes Curtin and Dobbs up to mine for gold, and shows them how to get along while prospecting while providing some hearty laughs for the audience. There are a few times I found myself laughing just as much as Howard himself, which I don't often do aloud by myself while watching films (even comedies); later on, this compliments the film itself, as laughter is a cathartic action for Curtin and Howard in the end. From the cinematography to the writing to the acting and overall direction of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, everything lines up perfect. An epic (I hate the overuse today of that word, but here it is truly deserved in the classical sense) tale of greed, honour, and pure evil, which could be placed today in the current state of the oil business; Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood bridges this film to the audiences of today who are more akin to the oil industry than that of gold. Once again, that is a reason why this film holds up today because the themes here are the same ones running through the veins of society these days. In the end, two of the characters learn a highly valuable lesson that there are worse things than the loss of wealth. 10 out of 10 and HIGHLY recommended for any true lover of cinema. "We've wounded this mountain. It's our duty to close her wounds."

    The Treasure of Sierra Madre is a reflection on some of the most basic human values. Greed for money, trust in friends, courage and loyalty, always helping the needy are some of themes that manifest themselves on the screen during different times. The acting is brilliant in this movie. Humphrey Bogart is spot on with his portrayal of an impecunious bloke, who wants an opportunity to make it big, and his transformation from that to a mistrusting, nefarious lunatic. Tim Holt and Walter Huston complement Bogart wonderfully and act as models of rectitude and self-righteousness. The bandits and the Indians put in captivating performances. The scene at the end ,when Holt and Huston's characters laugh at the game fate put them through just to set them off to the next chapters in their life where they can feel contented, served as a fitting end to an impressive movie by John Huston.

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

    THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all. But it was. THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich. Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed. THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance. Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene. The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him. If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.

    A morality story of distrust, savagery, and survival in the Mexican desert Three men roaming the world at loose ends hook up in Tampico, Mexico and band together to prospect for gold. We have the hard-luck, embittered wanderer, Fred Dobbs, "Dobsy," the grizzled, veteran prospector, Howard, and the youngest of the trio, the decent, callow Bob Curtin. Joining forces, they share a commonality of purpose: they all lust to find that one big strike that will give them the riches to set them up for life. Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt play these three itinerants, making for a powerful ensemble of talent whose performances bring a timeless relevance to this story of human greed, and redemption. With these elements the film could have easily been just another preachy sermon with cardboard characters representing good and evil. But here not so. The acting is superb, the script is intelligent and vivid. John Huston's direction shows that he understood the motivational complexities at play in these three men; he knew what these men were about and was able to transfer that admirably to the movie screen. Humphrey Bogart's "Dobsy," a man embittered by life, is fully invested, body and soul in this search for gold. His commitment is fierce, total and uncompromising. The desert trek for the big gold strike is his last chance to grab the prize of the brass ring after enduring a lifetime of long, dead end, bumpy rides. Howard, as masterfully portrayed by Walter Huston, is the wise old man seasoned by hardscrabble experience. No illusions for this old-timer; he serves as the voice of reason and moral principles. He's the pillar of strength straddling the middle ground, constantly policing clashes between his two cohorts. When Dobbs and Curtin clash he's the mediating force working to diffuse tension and stave off violent argument. Tim Holt plays the guy who has the physical and emotional advantages of youth on his side. Not yet beaten down by life into a fatalistic pessimism, he has an inner decency, and expectations; to him life is still a vista of possibilities. The threat of Mexican bandits lurks among the three prospectors as a constant threat. The banditos offer a hovering menace as well as a device for black humor. Actor Alfonso Bedoya, the head bad guy, utters a few lines of dialogue that still resonate today. When challenged he voices a self-proclaimed authority that needs no official validation. He doesn't "need no stinking badges!" A story of desperation, greed, and of how fate that unpredictable determinator inserts itself into events to throw a wrench in the works, turning the best laid plans of men into just dust blowing in the desert wind.

    Τhe theme of this film is about a treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains. It's a classic movie with action and adventure. The direction of this movie for the time that it was filmed (1948) is very good and that's why John Huston won the academy award of Best Director. I also liked the performances of Humphrey Bogart (Dobbs) as one of the American who searches for work in Mexico but can not find so he is going to find the treasure in the Sierra Madre Mountains, and the performance of Tim Holt (Curtin) as one of the partners of Humphrey Bogart. In this movie you will see how the reactions of a person changes when money are the most important thing of the people and you will understand how the situation changes because of them.

    One of the first-rate westerns as well as one of the finest films ever made, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a superbly directed, adapted and acted cinema that even after a span of more than 6 decades hasn't aged a day. Featuring 3 brilliant performances from Humphrey Bogart, Walter Hudson & Tim Holt that alone elevated this film to an instant classic status, while also presenting a very gripping story of treasure hunting blended with the themes of friendship, doubt, greed & fate, the movie is tightly edited and creates an excellent atmosphere of doubt & suspense throughout its runtime and culminates with an unexpected but if seen from a different paradigm, a truly fitting finale. Beautifully portraying the corrupting power of greed, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a must for every cinema lover.

    The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully. And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie. Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade. Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too. Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico. Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clich&eacute;s, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work. I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.

    I realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed "corny", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven. One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays "overacting" or maybe even "being melodramatic". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about "guilt" and "conscience" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious. I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming "bandit uniform". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic. There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a "white man". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the "sand" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.

    Many things are for certain to any cinephile who knows the basics of what good entertainment is: 1) Walter Huston can't be beat; an actor of the finest form who understands dramatics better than most any who came before or after him. 2) Humphrey Bogart has a certain charm on film that is unmatched.

    Based on German author B. Traven's 1927 novel with the same title, the movie has a great set on about men losing their sanity due to Greed. It's was create by Traven to blast the United States for coming to Mexico only to exploit the country's natural resources after the Mexican Revoultion left the country in ruins. It can also mirror what he felt about United States exploit European countries like Germany after World War I. The only problem is that nobody had the slightest idea who he was. Some people feel that B. Traven is a nom de plum, (Pen Name) as the author's true identity, nationality, and background have been hotly contested from the start, a literary guessing game surpassed only by the who-wrote-Shakespeare controversy. While it's never explain who is the man under the novel, it's clear as day that John Huston directed this movie. This John Huston film begins with Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a loner bumming off money from rich people and taking odd jobs at Tampico, Mexico in 1925. It's never explain why Fred Dobbs is there, broke or why there were so many poor Americans living in Mexico at that time, when it's clearly proved that United States was riding high at the time. In my opinion, Traven was a Anarchist, not fan of Capitalism and he use Fred Dobbs as a tool to show the wrongs of it. The audience is made to believe, that Fred Dobbs into might have came from America to Mexico due to some crime unexplained in his past, which would help explain why it was easier mislead by dreams of getting rich. Tired of getting rip-off for their hard work and naive nature, and not getting pay. Dobbs and his co-worker/friend Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) decide to join a grizzled old prospector Howard (Walter Huston) in search of gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains. Through enormous difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into tragedy. The greed hits Dobbs hard, as it's turns into a Mammon type character. Dobbs is unreasonably afraid that he will be killed by his partners losing his trust, and always trying to see about killing them first because of the three lusting to possess the entire treasure. While Humphrey Bogart is awesome actor, his character is not the Indiana Jones hero that unknown people who haven't read the novel are thinking coming in this movie. Dobbs is a awful character who just get worst and worst with the gold. Dobbs isn't the hero, Howard or Curtin are more honorable to be label heroes due to them getting their redemption. I think Tim Holt got short shift for one of the great displays of acting in this movie. Huston makes the movie funny with his knee slapping dance while Bogat gives the movie it's dark side. Huston does a remarkable job of depicting the prospectors' collective slide into distrust and then outright paranoia. It's a American adventure story as a mythic battle between reason and madness. There are plenty of actions, from bar fights to shoot outs with Mexican bandits. In the bar fight, it's just amazes that the camera is so close and yet they use doubles so effectively. Put the guys face in shadow and it is amazing how you can not recognize his stunt double if not pausing the frame. The movie has a very interesting screenplay, and the film has a speech full of human psychology and people's reaction to greed. Gold doesn't change a man, it just reveals what he really is. This is a statement on value and finding out what or who you really are, and what is of real value. Best (inadvertent) summation of Adam Smith's " Wealth of Nations " in my opinion. The film is also known for it's famous one-liner about badges, or what I heard 'stinking badgers'. Yes, you don't want stinking badgers there. That would be bad. I don't know why it's famous, its rather funny than dramatic but it will always be special because of how Alphonso Bedoya says it. Once upon a time, Sierra Madre had the stigma of having been written by a Socialist. However, the film has a neutral philosophy and deals with the theme of human nature, rather than any particular message, so it get a pass. Check it out and tell me what you think of the film.

    A movie that pushed boundaries and challenged conventions as to what Hollywood entertainment might mean, "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" still makes for a bracing experience, solidly enjoyable on the whole though a touch over-rated. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) is not a pleasant fellow. After hitting up strangers for drinking money, he tells a boy selling lottery tickets: "Get away from me you little beggar." As a travelling companion he leaves much to be desired, especially when there's gold involved. Yet he's essentially decent enough as Bogie plays him to give us a rooting interest and a sense of concern as he begins his inevitable decline after striking it rich with two partners, wily old Howard (Walter Huston) and young Curtin (Tim Holt). It's a fine performance for that reason, and maybe why many count it as Bogart's best character. For me he undergoes a pretty sudden personality shift that's not justified by a somewhat deterministic script, based on a novel by a Marxist-anarchist who believed materialism to be inherently debasing. This concept is expressed by Howard in one of many memorable scenes, when he talks about the inevitability of betrayal on a gold strike and is told by Dobbs he has a "dirty, filthy mind." "Not dirty, baby," Howard replies. "Only I know what kind of ideas even decent people get when gold's at stake." Dobbs is the vehicle for that message, and is forced to carry too much thematic baggage. Is he really that greedy, or just crazy from the heat? His diabolical laughter offers no clue. Along with an overwrought Max Steiner score, this disconnect between early Dobbs and later Dobbs undercuts "Sierra Madre" noticeably (though not fatally.) The film actually makes a stronger case against capitalism in a subplot involving a fellow named Cody (Bruce Bennett) who wanders into the protagonists' mining camp looking for a piece of the action. As they consider what to do with him, director/writer John Huston does clever work making you the viewer their co-conspirator, ready to accept the direst outcome. Later, he does even better work making you feel guilty about this. Kudos too for the film's iconic ending, and for Walter Huston's dynamic supporting performance, both of which fully deserve their places in movie lore. Holt is very good, too, in the thankless but not entirely unshaded role of the decent guy in the movie. This is worth watching even if just for that famous line nobody actually says here. ("We don't need no stinkin' badges" is heard in "Blazing Saddles," not here, like "Play it again, Sam" in another Bogie movie.) "Sierra Madre's" even better for what is on offer here, the quintessential "south-of-the-border" adventure tale and a signpost for many films, great and otherwise, that came after.

    THE FILM: 1948. John Huston hasn't made a movie since the ill-fated 1946 documentary "Let There Be Light". The last narrative film he made was 1942's Across The Pacific. So when Huston chose B. Traven's bleak novel to be his next project, studio heads were noticeably worried. Adding to the worry was the fact that Huston refused to shoot his film in the studio. He wanted to shoot it entirely on location, and he refused to budge. Add into the mix a balding Bogart and a faded star in Walter Huston, and it seems almost incredible that the film was made at all. But it was. THE PLOT: Fred Dobbs, a down on his luck American drifter in Mexico, gets by by begging passerby's for money. He sleeps on the streets, and in a homeless shelter when he can. It is there that he meets Curtain, a fellow down on his luck drifter. Together they hear of old prospector Howard's tales of gold and fortune out in the desert. Hatching a plan with Howard, the three set out for the Sierra Madre, hoping to strike it rich. Dobbs and Curtain learn the tricks of the trade from Howard. It isn't long before local outlaws begin to cause trouble, and at the same time they manage to find a vein of gold, but nearby prospector's come into balance. The weather plays a part in setting them further and further away from their goal. Then of course there is greed. THE CRITICISM: I'll be honest, this film is overrated. I don't like as much as a probably should, but it is a very intriguing film. Bogart is excellent, and I did feel that he became kind of hammy at the end, but that was typical of the time. His performance strikes a great balance of being innocent, yet smarmy at the same time. That is until, he completely throws out the balance and beats it to a bloody pulp. That is not a criticism, but it can't surprise you that much, thanks to the layers to Bogart's performance. Tim Holt, as Curtain isn't amazing. He provides the calm in between necessary, but he doesn't have much of a commanding presence, which doesn't help him, but it does suit the character. However, the main acting achievement on display is that of Walter Huston. Huston owns every scene he's in, and he totally dominates the film. His son John's decision to cast him isn't nepotism, he is a great actor, and he proves it. In every scene. The visuals are bleak and as desolate as can be. The scenes in the desert have a certain rugged beauty to them, and this makes the setting perfect for the scenes of greed and corruption that follow. Speaking of greed, that could have been the film's title. Greed is what drives the plot, and is what dooms the characters from the start. In the beginning, Bogart keeps asking the same white suited American (played by John Huston, of course) for money. He doesn't stop this, and eventually the man in the white suit confronts him. If you watch Bogart's eyes, you see him not paying attention to what the man is saying, but the coin he is holding in his hand. Greed drives Dobbs to the treasure, and also to his end. Huston's direction is terrific, he lets his observe the scenes passively, yet never being showy. However, as I stated above, the film is overrated. It is very interesting, but easily boring at the same time. It is great for discussion, but hard for enjoyment. I will say one thing for the film, it has a terrific ending. From all the Huston's I've seen so far, I've noticed that they all have great endings. From The Maltese Falcon to The Misfits, with The Night Of The Iguana being perhaps the only exception, so far, the endings have been standouts. I won't ruin it, but it is a great ending to a good film. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston and Tim Holt Directed by John Huston 7.5/10 (B) (This review is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie.
