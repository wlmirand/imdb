    In "8 Seconds" (1994), Lane Frost (Luke Perry) is a young man from Oklahoma who learns to ride, hoping to win the approval of his father. As Lane works his way up the rodeo circuit with his best friend Tuff Hedeman (Stephen Baldwin), he meets Kelly Kyle (Cynthia Geary), a pretty barrel-race rider with whom he falls in love. Lane and Kelly marry, and while Lane's dedication to rodeo and its fans earns him a devoted following, it also keeps him away from Kelly and threatens to sink their relationship. Lane's hard work pays off when he wins the 1987 world championship, but the danger of the sport catches up with him two years later, when he dies as a result of an accident during competition. This movie was made to commemorate the life of Lane Frost. Lane was the typical boy. At a young age he started to bull ride. He traveled around with his best friends and he made his way up the rodeo circuit. He followed his dreams. They made the movie to show that Lane lived his life to the fullest. He made mistakes just like the normal person. Also that Lane died doing what he loved. He did not let the fear of death stop him from doing what he loved to do. He had his minor injuries every now and then, but he did not let that stop him also. This just shows us that if a bull rider could do it we could do it also. Growing up always loving animals the movie intrigued me to want to watch it. With loving horses and cows I knew that "8 Seconds" would be a movie that I would love. After watching the movie I saw that it was about more than just the fact of rodeos. The movie taught me to always follow your dreams no matter the risk. I believe there is no better way to die if I am doing what I love!

    This film was recommended to me years ago and I wish I had of watched it sooner. Before I really say anything, I'd like to mention that if you have something against 'cowboys' or 'country life' then don't watch it. Its about cowboys, bull riding, horses, country life, country jokes and yes some of it is crude. The acting is brilliant, the story line is strong and true to the real story of Lane, with casting that really complements the story. It is a 90's film so its dated, but this only makes it seem more honest and true. The country lifestyle is shown well and I guess this is part of the reason a lot of people don't like it - country jokes and country boys are often crude and seemingly disrespectful, and for someone who doesn't really understand it the 'redneck' stereotype can certainly sway opinion. This has to be one of my favorite films despite how sad it is. It really does pull on the heartstrings. It helps that Luke perry is great looking in this film. Cowboy Up!

    I had taped and watched this movie several times and I always see something new in it. Lane Frost had three tries at Red Rock and finally rode him after the bull had thrown some 316 or so, bull riders. There was some confusion about the bull in Cheyenne Wyoming. As he got on the bull there, there was a lot of background noise as the announcer was talking and we did not hear the name of that bull that killed Lane Frost. I backed the tape up over and over but it did not come out. Later, I started researching the internet finally got the name of that bull. For anyone who is a curious as I am, the actual name of the Bull was "Taking Care of Business". Thanks.

    This is a biopic about Rodeo superstar Lane Frost. It tells his story of living in his fathers footsteps and becoming a legend in his sport. It tells of how he met the love of his life and the ups and downs of his career full of broken bones and broken homes. A must see for anyone who knew his story, or followed Rodeo competitions. It will be enjoyed by those who like a good honest story about a real person. The acting was really good here and although Luke Perry was a huge star on Beverly Hills 90210, to me this is by far his best acting role. Stephen Baldwin is th only guy I wish they had replaced, those Baldwin's (with the exception of Alec in some roles) are just bad actors. The movie was good production wise, and whoever is responsible for shooting and arranging the bull-riding sequences did a great job too. It has a lot of heart. Lane is a great guy and everyone loves him, but he wants his dad to be as proud of him as the rest of the world is, doesn't every boy that looks up to their dad deserve to be told how proud they are. The movie shows that it takes a lot sometimes to know what love is, and it truly shows that following your dreams can make and often break a person. This movie was a good little drama. It was slow at times and thats what hurt it for me, it has some very dated stuff which makes it cheesy. I wish they had made it a little more exciting, but it has tons of dialog and lovey dovey appeal. It is often labeled as an action and other than the bull-riding it is not action at all, and its often called a family movie, but although it has a pg-13 rating, I think it is not family friendly, not for younger kids anyway. If you like sad drama's give it a try, or if you like rodeo stuff. I still can't give it more than 3 stars cause it didn't do a whole lot for me. Yee Haw!

    I came upon this movie in a curious way. Natalie, now 19, saw it and remembered it from her young childhood. She said she thought I would like it. After I watched the movie I asked her why she liked and remembered it so well. She said it was because she likes bull riding. Quite a comment from a 99 pound girl!! Luke Perry is Lane Frost who from a very young age wanted to be a champion bull rider. The movie concentrates on the period in the 1980s when he and his friends traveled all over the southwest in a car, driving from one rodeo to another. Frost was known for his friendliness, big smile, and always willing to help out. And also pay attention to the fans, especially the younger ones. Cynthia Geary (of Northern Exposure fame) is Kellie, a champion barrel racer. At one rodeo the two of them met, soon became more than friends and later married. A central figure in Lane's life was James Rebhorn as his dad Clyde Frost. We see that Clyde, although clearly proud of his son, hardly ever gave Lane praise, but instead often told him that he needed to get tougher, to do better. Even as Lane was approaching world champion status as a bull rider. This had a negative effect and Lane became moody and hard to be around at times. Another key character was Stephen Baldwin as the uneven tempered Tuff Hedeman. As part of the byline at the end of the movie the real Tuff credits Lane with his successful transition in life. Good movie, has a lot of bull riding and a good dramatic story. SPOILERS: Anyone who knows the history of this story also knows that Lane Frost met an untimely death in 1989, ironically just a few months after Natalie was born. He has just had a successful ride and jumped onto the ground. The bull turned and gored him such that a rib broke and punctured a major artery near his heart. He died there in the rodeo arena of excessive bleeding. He was still in his 20s.

    I thought this was an excellent film. THis film was great and it made me shed a tear and put a lump in my throat, and I'm not ashamed at all. And it was fairly accurate to his life, although from what I've heard and read, Lane and Kelly never really cheated on each other it was just added for the film for more drama. And as a personal friend of Stephen Baldwin, I'm not just saying all of this because he's in it, although it makes it more fun and enjoyable to watch the film even more. I saw this film before and after I knew him, and now when I see him I always quote the movie to him and talk to him about it. I think it is a great movie truly inspirational, it really touches the heart! I would recommend this movie to anyone, you don't have to have any interest in bull riding or cowboys for that matter, to enjoy this film!

    This movie is heart breaking. It is even more so because I lived in Caddo, OK and Lane Frost came there. My brother was close to Lane because he has a son that was Lane's age. The movie was touching but not all true. From what I understand Lane's father was not the way he is portrayed in the movie. Lane was someone to be admired. We own the movie and watch it a lot. Tuff signed the cover for us. Everyone should see this movie at least once. Lane's life was worth telling. He was a good guy. Just a good Oklahoma boy. I hope many, many people view this movie and remember Lane Frost. It is too bad his life could not have gone on longer. Cowboy up ya'll

    This movie is a great tribute to Lane Frost. This brings out the best in any movie viewer and it makes us take a look at what's important. Get this movie today, but don't forget the box of tissues. The acting, music, and directing of this movie adds to the overall effect. Luke Perry is at his best in this movie. I especially like the montage at the end of the movie-it brings out feelings and realizations that anything can happen at any time. I bought this movie to watch over and over again.

    i saw the movie 8 Seconds after going to my first rodeo. as a huge rodeo fan i loved the movie and give it a ten on the scale. it was a wonderful representation of lane frost's life. i watched the movie with Lane Frost's biggest fan and as we were watching the movie he correctly pointed out a couple misleadings in the film. Lane frost's riding buddy Cody did not write poems in real life. and one other incorrect fact in the movie was that Lane and his wife Kelli cheated on each other. in actuality they never did. they were happily married. even with these mistakes this movie is still kick butt for any country person, especially if you love rodeo, and i do! Luke perry does a fabulous job of portraying Lane Frost! thanks Luke, you rock!

    Lane is a hero, he tried his best and he succeeded well. That day was his best ride and I will love too shake his hand when I get to that fine ole' place up there. I will be a bull rider when I am older in the pbr although I am a girl and I will ride for him! I will make that 8.o seconds or however long it does take to make me feel good about showing you I care. I have never met you but I feel like I know you. You will always be in my heart and I hope everyone who see's this feels the same way about lane frost or you shouldn't be here, if you ain't a cowgirl who care's you should still care about the guy who lived his life for rodeo and made a line of respect for everyone in the pbr. love, taylor hanson

    In "8 Seconds" (1994), Lane Frost (Luke Perry) is a young man from Oklahoma who learns to ride, hoping to win the approval of his father. As Lane works his way up the rodeo circuit with his best friend Tuff Hedeman (Stephen Baldwin), he meets Kelly Kyle (Cynthia Geary), a pretty barrel-race rider with whom he falls in love. Lane and Kelly marry, and while Lane's dedication to rodeo and its fans earns him a devoted following, it also keeps him away from Kelly and threatens to sink their relationship. Lane's hard work pays off when he wins the 1987 world championship, but the danger of the sport catches up with him two years later, when he dies as a result of an accident during competition. This movie was made to commemorate the life of Lane Frost. Lane was the typical boy. At a young age he started to bull ride. He traveled around with his best friends and he made his way up the rodeo circuit. He followed his dreams. They made the movie to show that Lane lived his life to the fullest. He made mistakes just like the normal person. Also that Lane died doing what he loved. He did not let the fear of death stop him from doing what he loved to do. He had his minor injuries every now and then, but he did not let that stop him also. This just shows us that if a bull rider could do it we could do it also. Growing up always loving animals the movie intrigued me to want to watch it. With loving horses and cows I knew that "8 Seconds" would be a movie that I would love. After watching the movie I saw that it was about more than just the fact of rodeos. The movie taught me to always follow your dreams no matter the risk. I believe there is no better way to die if I am doing what I love!

    This film was recommended to me years ago and I wish I had of watched it sooner. Before I really say anything, I'd like to mention that if you have something against 'cowboys' or 'country life' then don't watch it. Its about cowboys, bull riding, horses, country life, country jokes and yes some of it is crude. The acting is brilliant, the story line is strong and true to the real story of Lane, with casting that really complements the story. It is a 90's film so its dated, but this only makes it seem more honest and true. The country lifestyle is shown well and I guess this is part of the reason a lot of people don't like it - country jokes and country boys are often crude and seemingly disrespectful, and for someone who doesn't really understand it the 'redneck' stereotype can certainly sway opinion. This has to be one of my favorite films despite how sad it is. It really does pull on the heartstrings. It helps that Luke perry is great looking in this film. Cowboy Up!

    I had taped and watched this movie several times and I always see something new in it. Lane Frost had three tries at Red Rock and finally rode him after the bull had thrown some 316 or so, bull riders. There was some confusion about the bull in Cheyenne Wyoming. As he got on the bull there, there was a lot of background noise as the announcer was talking and we did not hear the name of that bull that killed Lane Frost. I backed the tape up over and over but it did not come out. Later, I started researching the internet finally got the name of that bull. For anyone who is a curious as I am, the actual name of the Bull was "Taking Care of Business". Thanks.

    This is a biopic about Rodeo superstar Lane Frost. It tells his story of living in his fathers footsteps and becoming a legend in his sport. It tells of how he met the love of his life and the ups and downs of his career full of broken bones and broken homes. A must see for anyone who knew his story, or followed Rodeo competitions. It will be enjoyed by those who like a good honest story about a real person. The acting was really good here and although Luke Perry was a huge star on Beverly Hills 90210, to me this is by far his best acting role. Stephen Baldwin is th only guy I wish they had replaced, those Baldwin's (with the exception of Alec in some roles) are just bad actors. The movie was good production wise, and whoever is responsible for shooting and arranging the bull-riding sequences did a great job too. It has a lot of heart. Lane is a great guy and everyone loves him, but he wants his dad to be as proud of him as the rest of the world is, doesn't every boy that looks up to their dad deserve to be told how proud they are. The movie shows that it takes a lot sometimes to know what love is, and it truly shows that following your dreams can make and often break a person. This movie was a good little drama. It was slow at times and thats what hurt it for me, it has some very dated stuff which makes it cheesy. I wish they had made it a little more exciting, but it has tons of dialog and lovey dovey appeal. It is often labeled as an action and other than the bull-riding it is not action at all, and its often called a family movie, but although it has a pg-13 rating, I think it is not family friendly, not for younger kids anyway. If you like sad drama's give it a try, or if you like rodeo stuff. I still can't give it more than 3 stars cause it didn't do a whole lot for me. Yee Haw!

    I came upon this movie in a curious way. Natalie, now 19, saw it and remembered it from her young childhood. She said she thought I would like it. After I watched the movie I asked her why she liked and remembered it so well. She said it was because she likes bull riding. Quite a comment from a 99 pound girl!! Luke Perry is Lane Frost who from a very young age wanted to be a champion bull rider. The movie concentrates on the period in the 1980s when he and his friends traveled all over the southwest in a car, driving from one rodeo to another. Frost was known for his friendliness, big smile, and always willing to help out. And also pay attention to the fans, especially the younger ones. Cynthia Geary (of Northern Exposure fame) is Kellie, a champion barrel racer. At one rodeo the two of them met, soon became more than friends and later married. A central figure in Lane's life was James Rebhorn as his dad Clyde Frost. We see that Clyde, although clearly proud of his son, hardly ever gave Lane praise, but instead often told him that he needed to get tougher, to do better. Even as Lane was approaching world champion status as a bull rider. This had a negative effect and Lane became moody and hard to be around at times. Another key character was Stephen Baldwin as the uneven tempered Tuff Hedeman. As part of the byline at the end of the movie the real Tuff credits Lane with his successful transition in life. Good movie, has a lot of bull riding and a good dramatic story. SPOILERS: Anyone who knows the history of this story also knows that Lane Frost met an untimely death in 1989, ironically just a few months after Natalie was born. He has just had a successful ride and jumped onto the ground. The bull turned and gored him such that a rib broke and punctured a major artery near his heart. He died there in the rodeo arena of excessive bleeding. He was still in his 20s.

    I thought this was an excellent film. THis film was great and it made me shed a tear and put a lump in my throat, and I'm not ashamed at all. And it was fairly accurate to his life, although from what I've heard and read, Lane and Kelly never really cheated on each other it was just added for the film for more drama. And as a personal friend of Stephen Baldwin, I'm not just saying all of this because he's in it, although it makes it more fun and enjoyable to watch the film even more. I saw this film before and after I knew him, and now when I see him I always quote the movie to him and talk to him about it. I think it is a great movie truly inspirational, it really touches the heart! I would recommend this movie to anyone, you don't have to have any interest in bull riding or cowboys for that matter, to enjoy this film!

    This movie is heart breaking. It is even more so because I lived in Caddo, OK and Lane Frost came there. My brother was close to Lane because he has a son that was Lane's age. The movie was touching but not all true. From what I understand Lane's father was not the way he is portrayed in the movie. Lane was someone to be admired. We own the movie and watch it a lot. Tuff signed the cover for us. Everyone should see this movie at least once. Lane's life was worth telling. He was a good guy. Just a good Oklahoma boy. I hope many, many people view this movie and remember Lane Frost. It is too bad his life could not have gone on longer. Cowboy up ya'll

    This movie is a great tribute to Lane Frost. This brings out the best in any movie viewer and it makes us take a look at what's important. Get this movie today, but don't forget the box of tissues. The acting, music, and directing of this movie adds to the overall effect. Luke Perry is at his best in this movie. I especially like the montage at the end of the movie-it brings out feelings and realizations that anything can happen at any time. I bought this movie to watch over and over again.

    i saw the movie 8 Seconds after going to my first rodeo. as a huge rodeo fan i loved the movie and give it a ten on the scale. it was a wonderful representation of lane frost's life. i watched the movie with Lane Frost's biggest fan and as we were watching the movie he correctly pointed out a couple misleadings in the film. Lane frost's riding buddy Cody did not write poems in real life. and one other incorrect fact in the movie was that Lane and his wife Kelli cheated on each other. in actuality they never did. they were happily married. even with these mistakes this movie is still kick butt for any country person, especially if you love rodeo, and i do! Luke perry does a fabulous job of portraying Lane Frost! thanks Luke, you rock!

    Lane is a hero, he tried his best and he succeeded well. That day was his best ride and I will love too shake his hand when I get to that fine ole' place up there. I will be a bull rider when I am older in the pbr although I am a girl and I will ride for him! I will make that 8.o seconds or however long it does take to make me feel good about showing you I care. I have never met you but I feel like I know you. You will always be in my heart and I hope everyone who see's this feels the same way about lane frost or you shouldn't be here, if you ain't a cowgirl who care's you should still care about the guy who lived his life for rodeo and made a line of respect for everyone in the pbr. love, taylor hanson

    In "8 Seconds" (1994), Lane Frost (Luke Perry) is a young man from Oklahoma who learns to ride, hoping to win the approval of his father. As Lane works his way up the rodeo circuit with his best friend Tuff Hedeman (Stephen Baldwin), he meets Kelly Kyle (Cynthia Geary), a pretty barrel-race rider with whom he falls in love. Lane and Kelly marry, and while Lane's dedication to rodeo and its fans earns him a devoted following, it also keeps him away from Kelly and threatens to sink their relationship. Lane's hard work pays off when he wins the 1987 world championship, but the danger of the sport catches up with him two years later, when he dies as a result of an accident during competition. This movie was made to commemorate the life of Lane Frost. Lane was the typical boy. At a young age he started to bull ride. He traveled around with his best friends and he made his way up the rodeo circuit. He followed his dreams. They made the movie to show that Lane lived his life to the fullest. He made mistakes just like the normal person. Also that Lane died doing what he loved. He did not let the fear of death stop him from doing what he loved to do. He had his minor injuries every now and then, but he did not let that stop him also. This just shows us that if a bull rider could do it we could do it also. Growing up always loving animals the movie intrigued me to want to watch it. With loving horses and cows I knew that "8 Seconds" would be a movie that I would love. After watching the movie I saw that it was about more than just the fact of rodeos. The movie taught me to always follow your dreams no matter the risk. I believe there is no better way to die if I am doing what I love!
