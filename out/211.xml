 <sinopse>
  The staff of a Korean War field hospital use humor and hijinks to keep their sanity in the face of the horror of war.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The personnel at the 4077 MASH unit deal with the horrors of the Korean War and the stresses faced in surgery by whatever means. The tone at the MASH is established by recent arrivals, surgeons Captains 'Hawkeye' Pierce, 'Duke' Forrest, and 'Trapper' John McIntyre - the latter who Hawkeye knows he's met somewhere, but Trapper who won't divulge where - whose antics can be best described as non-regulation, and in the negative words of one of their fellow MASH-ers: unmilitary. The unit's commanding officer, Colonel Henry Blake, doesn't care about this behavior as long as it doesn't affect him, and as long as they do their job and do it well, which they do. Their behavior does extremely bother fellow surgeon, Major Frank Burns, and recently arrived head nurse, Major Margaret Houlihan, who obtains the nickname 'Hot Lips' based on information they glean about her through underhanded means. Beyond their battles with Frank and Hot Lips, Hawkeye, Duke and/or Trapper help unit dentist Painless ...

    MASH is one of the greatest Comedies Of all time and a classic film that combines amazing direction,a fantastic ensemble cast,hilarious Black Comedy,wonderful script and a memorable film score making MASH one of Altman's best and a classic Comedy and War Film and not only one of the best films of the 1970s but one of the greatest films ever made. Based on the novel MASH:A Novel About Three Army Doctors and set during the Korean War in the early 1950s,MASH tells the story of a group of Army surgeons that includes Capt. Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),Trapper John McIntyre(Elliot Gould)and Duke Forrest(Tom Skerritt)that work inside a hospital and deal with Horrors of the War while getting into hilarious situations and misadventures. Before MASH was turned into the iconic and popular television series of the same name,MASH was an amazing,hilarious and edgy Black Comedy classic that was an Anti-War Satire and was also a cinema breakthrough for filmmaker Robert Altman and is a film that ranks with other great films and Black Comedies Dr Strangelove and Network and is one of the film that gave birth to the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s. One of the reasons MASH is a classic film is because Robert Altman takes the concept and subject of War and makes an Anti-War film that mocks the military and Wars in a funny and Satirical way that is bold and brave and at the same time creative and subversive in a original style. The Comedy and laughs in MASH is funny and hilarious and is done with in darkly Humorous way with scenes and dialog in the film that is smart and intelligent and can only exist in the bizarre and insane world of MASH that is truly wacky and offbeat and done with a weirdness and insane energy that never slows down or lets up until the very end and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I also love that The Comedy is politically incorrect and is the kind of Humor that you don't really see in films anymore and would offend viewers in today's world. What I also love about MASH is the episodic nature and structure of the film where there are scenes in the movie that jump from one to the next and some of the characters pop in and out of the narrative but the film is never disjointed or disconnected and I think the episodic style keeps the film moving at a great pace. While the film is set during the Korean War in the 1950s,MASH is more about the Vietnam War that was going on in the during the 1960s and 70s and Altman doesn't hold back in showing the danger and Horrors of going to War especially during the Hospital and surgery scenes which are done in a gritty and realistic way almost like a documentary of Surgery in Hospitals during a War. MASH is a Comedy and it is very funny but it's still an Anti-War film that is told from a cynical point of view that is harsh and unflinching. The three main characters in the film Hawkeye Pierce,Trapper John McIntyre and Duke Forrest are great and truly memorable characters because when you look at the characters you feel like that even though they are surgeons of War they don't really want to be in the War or military but rather in a bar drinking a small glass of martini,flirting with women or being at home and not participating in the War. The many scenes with Hawkeye and Trapper or the scenes the three main characters have together is funny and wonderful with the characters Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke saying memorable dialog that is very fresh,sarcastic and witty as well. Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke are three amazing characters you will never forget. The screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. is wonderful and well-written even much of the dialog was improvised by the cast and there's a lot of scenes of overlapping dialog between the main characters that is great and would become one of the many trademarks of Altman's films. The final 20-30 minutes and the film's ending is amazing and matches the rest of the film's manic comic energy. A great ending. The whole cast is wonderful. Donald Sutherland is excellent and hilarious as Captain Hawkeye Pierce,with Sutherland bringing laughs and coolness to the role. Elliot Gould is brilliant and funny as Captain Trapper John McIntyre and has great scenes with Sutherland. Tom Skerritt is amazing as Duke Forrest,Hawkeye and Trapper's friend. Sally Kellerman is fantastic as Major Hot Lips O'Houlihan,a straight laced nurse. Robert Duvall is wonderful as Major Frank Burns,an fellow Army Surgeon. Roger Bowen is terrific as Colonial Henry Blake,a man who's in charge of the MASH unit. Gary Burghoff is great as Corporal Radar,Blake right hand man. Burghoff also played the role on the television series. David Arkin is funny as Sgt. Major Vollmer,a by the book soldier. Jo Ann Plug is sensational and beautiful as Lt. Dish,Hawkeye's love interest. Fred Williamson is outstanding as Dr. Spearchucker Jones,a Football player who's now a surgeon. Michael Murphy is great as Me Lai Larston,a Surgeon in Japan. John Schuck is fantastic as Capt. Painless Waldowski,a dentist. G. Wood(General Hammond),Bud Cort(Private Boone)and Rene Auberjonois(Father John 'Dago Red' Mulcahy)give good performances as well. The direction by Robert Altman is brilliant,with Altman always moving the camera with zooms and close ups and giving the film a gritty and realistic look. Great direction by Altman. The score by Johnny Mandel is fantastic and memorable and brings a light and fun feeling to the film. I also love the classic theme song Suicide Is Painless that is used for the film(and later for the television series)and it truly matches the film's tone. In final word,if you love Robert Altman,Comedies,Black Comedies,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see MASH,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    To me, Altman's second-best film, behind "Nashville," which is so uniquely brilliant, it defies classification! Regardless of it being set during the Korean War, this is obviously a commentary on the insanity of the current-at-that-time Vietnam War, and of war in general. The surgeons are endlessly patching up the badly wounded, and they keep coming. The endless cycle leads to the surgeons and other personnel just trying to keep sane. There is quite of mix of gore and laughs as the characters make their way through the conflict. And, surreal moments that transcend it all. Altman was a master at breaking the rules, and has a dream cast that makes the film perfect. I saw this at the 75th Anniversary for 20th Century Fox at Lincoln Center in 2010. I got to meet and have a real conversation with Elliott Gould, easily the best interaction with a celebrity I have ever had. There was a showing of a new 35mm print of the film, and a post discussion with Elliott, Tom Skerritt, and the wife of Mr. Altman. I even have a signed poster! Excellent film, easily watchable again and again. And, the P.A. announcements are so very funny! ********** (10 Out of 10 Stars)

    The film MASH opens with the arrival of Captain Pierce and Duke Forrest in an army field hospital as sergeants during the Korean War and ends with their departure. And in between we have the life of men and women in the camp. There are little pieces of stories and incidents we get to know about, some of them are funny, some disgusting and some empty. It's very difficult to talk about the film, not because it's obscure but because it is vastly pointless. It becomes quite clear that Robert Altman tried his best to make a film out of these little pieces, and that is probably the biggest drawback of the film - his effort shows. I won't blame Jean Luc Godard for not being able to tell a story the way it should be told, because his intentions were never to do so. He can be criticized for what he tried not for what he didn't. But unfortunately, Altman's success or failure in MASH should be judged in terms of these stories through which he tries to get inside this Army field hospital and of course the way he puts it. Looking back at a film like MASH made around 40 years ago, it is quite difficult to figure out the reasons behind its popularity, and hey, it's far from experimental too. The question is what is the film then? What is it about? Well, it's kind of a comedy which doesn't make you laugh that much. It's kind of an anti-war film that doesn't have much to say against war. It's kind of a psychological endeavor that doesn't penetrate. The film, MASH, is careless and indiscipline one, very much like the characters it depicts. MASH is probably a satirical, bit circus tic, black and bleak comedy  mostly ineffective. I think MASH is a war film that, fortunately, has nothing to do with heroism, bravery, patriotism or honor  instead it's about sadism, cruelty, cowardice and utter stupidity. I feel sad at the end of the film precisely because of its inability to take this influential project further. It fails to build up the characters it portrays. We are never at home with them; we don't know how to react. These characters never grow; they provide us no reason to follow them. Think about the football match sequence, all of a sudden we have a football match coming up from nowhere, and that too an elaborated coverage, the whole thing was absolutely rubbish and the film could have been better without it. Think about the suicide drama, think about the Korean boy they all seem stories out of place - we don't know them; we aren't linked. There are certain things that I find very disgusting too, for example, the way the film portrays the female character, hot lips. She arrives in the camp with a mission; she finds the whole atmosphere in the camp very messy and unorganized. She talks about discipline and order, and throughout the rest of the film she is mocked by everyone. She almost becomes a ridiculous and stupid creature, readily available for everything. She only finds Frank, but even Frank is forced to leave the field hospital by Captain Pierce and others. Hot lips' privacy is badly hampered twice, once when she is having sex with Frank, someone puts the microphone inside the room, and the whole hospital gets to hear the sounds. Secondly, all the temporary curtains were taken off while she is taking a bath, and she is exposed fully in front of everybody seated outside, with even musical instruments, a gallant show of laughter and disdain, and a worst possible part of the film for me. She is further ridiculed when she goes to the room of the officer in charge or whatever to complain about all these, we see her absolutely unable to make her point being angry and ends up shouting and crying, saying nothing. She is ridiculous, vague, overtly emotional and probably stretched as far as someone crazy. I don't know what Robert Altman wanted to achieve by all these, cruelty, disrespect, irresponsibility, perversion, voyeurism of these people in the military field hospital? May be, but since his whole project is a failure, at the end, it seems a perversion on the part of the director and nothing else. Hey, MASH won one of the most prestigious film awards of all, the P'lm Dore at the Cannes film festival in 1970, something it doesn't deserve, really.

    There was so much pain after that war. Most of you commenting weren't even born yet and you don't know the turmoil the media constantly thrust at the American public trying to get ratings and using the networks for political agendas mostly condemning the war. America was more naive and gullible and not as jaded as they are now. In a very tangible way every week and right in front of them on their TV screens was a way to draw the whole country back together in MASH. Whether you were for or against the war it made the soldiers who fought in the war more real and more human. They had faults.. some of them were terrible faults and some of them had wonderful strengths but America had suffered enough and it was time to laugh and get on with life. It wasn't a show that could work before that time or after that time but during that time MASH because a way for people to feel more normal about surviving that part of American history. Laughter is good medicine. There are many many comedic tactics considered genius in their time that audiences no longer respond to now in any way. When you watch these older movies and television series you have to understand the context in which they were created and what their audience needed from that project at that time.

    Finally got around to watching (skimming through is more likely) the movie M*A*S*H. It was a popular TV show in the 70's and even my parents talked about watching the movie version when it was first released. But I was absolutely horrified and disgusted by its cynicism and callousness. There was no plot to the movie at all, and it wasn't funny. Donald Southerland is the farthest from being a funny actor, although he's not a big mouth like Alan Alda. Anybody wishing to be a medical doctor would be disillusioned by the seeming purposelessness of the surgeons working in a mobile army surgical hospital during the Korean War. Furthermore, the lyrics of the opening song shocked me: "suicide is painless. And I can take or leave it if I please." I would understand if these words came out of the mouths of desperate wounded soldiers, but they are not suitable for a drama about army surgeons. In addition, the movie pretends the characters were living in America; there is no mention about Korea even though it takes place in Korea during the terrible tragedies of the Korean War.

    I saw M*A*S*H with my mom when I was eight years old when it was first released in 1970. It was held over, when movie theaters would hold over films that made a lot of money. It was made for an estimated budget of 3.5 million dollars. It made 81 million in revenue, it was a big hit in those days. It was a milestone for Robert Altman, and put him on the map as a director. I was only eight but enjoyed the humor and the sexuality was more implied than graphic. Two years later when the series premiered on CBS, I readily tuned in to see how it compared to the film. It was a TV standards and practices marvel, in that CBS tried to get across the subversive point across as much as they could on a TV sitcom. Being a series of vignettes rather than a chronological film, it showed a new way to film movies. It was movie making genius then, and still holds up to scrutiny today.

    I only enjoyed the wits, dialogs & some dirty jokes by Sutherland. That's all. Other than the funny part, the screenplay is quite good, writing is fresh & the music (Suicide Is Painless) amazed me. MASH is an out-dated comedy weaker than Animal House. The plot or story isn't that great to follow. The characters take you for some jokes & comic thrills here and there. Those are the only points where you will enjoy this movie NOW in the YOLO generation. I don't know how it won the Golden Palm, but this is not my cup of war tea. For crying out loud, an average 5/10. BOTTOM LINE: This is not a classic as they (Wikipedia) say(s), but a sure one-time watch unless war comedies related to misogyny & lots of female nudity bore the hell out of you. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Language: No | Sex: Strong | Nudity: Very Strong | Mouth-Kiss, Foreplay: Strong | Violence: Mild | Gore: Infinity | Smoking: No | Alcohol, Drugs: Strong

    M*A*S*H* is a terrific movie with a great storyline,a fantastic and talented cast,plenty of hilarious scenes and some serious drama.The movie has made a terrific legacy for itself,a series of the same name was made two years later,and it ran for eleven years.I think the show is a lot better,its much funnier,more light hearted and much less violence.The cast of this movie is terrific,I think the best actor was Elliot Gould,because I found his character Trapper John McIntyre to be the funniest and stood out the most out of all of them,I also enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Tom Skerritt. A staff working in a field hospital during a Korean War use there humor and laughter to make them forget about the violence and horror of the war they are facing.

    When I first saw "Mash" back in 1970 or thereabouts I was certain that it was a masterpiece of filmmaking. Over the years, I've had occasion to see it several more times, and each time it's diminished a bit. It's obvious that the movie only masquerades as being about "Korea", this is about Viet Nam. In that light it's interesting that the humor seemed much easier to accept while the war in Viet Nam was still playing in our living rooms every night. It was irreverent and "in-your-face", but a viable counterpoint to the horror of what was actually going on in S.E. Asia. Since the war is - thankfully - long since over, the humor now seems simply mean-spirited and thoughtless.And Hawkeye and Trapper are simple smart-ass jerks. There's little noteworthy outside of the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper. Radar is pleasant enough, Hotlips and Frank Burns are just uncomfortable to watch. The rest is simply wallpaper. I guess my conclusion is that this was a movie for the moment. It doesn't hold up well now with 40 years of history under the bridge.

    No idea why this movie is considered to be a genre classic really. I don't know, perhaps I needed to be around at 1970 to fully understand its appeal and appreciate it, since it certainly was a popular movie at the time, that even had an even more successful TV-series following it up, only 2 years later. Thing that the movie is known and praised for, is its heavy anti-war message in it. Well, not a message really but it makes a statement by turning a war situation into something comical. Perhaps this was something that really spoke to people at the time because of America's involved with the Vietnam war. In that regard, this movie is perhaps being a bit too much a product of its time and has lost it relevance and impact. But that does not make a bad movie of course. What does make this movie quite bad is that it simply isn't very fun or funny to watch at all. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I chuckled just once. The rest of the movie mostly consists out of people talking over each other and behaving incredibly immature. This was another real problem I had with this movie; All of the characters behaved like a bunch of brats and really not one of them was being likable enough for me. This was perhaps the biggest reason why I just couldn't ever enjoy watching this movie. But really, another big problem of the movie for me was that it didn't even featured a main story in it. It made this movie come across as a real pointless one, that was never being good, interesting or funny enough. It just isn't going anywhere with any of it. Perhaps it was to show the whole pointlessness of war but this doesn't make the movie any more pleasant or good to follow. Maybe it would had also helped if the movie did actually showed some of its war but now I really never had the feeling as if the movie was taking place during a war situation. The cast-list sound interesting, with people such as Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall and Rene Auberjonois in it but most of them were still pretty big unknowns at the time and their roles also aren't all that big. The movie doesn't have one main character in it but it instead focuses on a whole bunch of them, for an equal amount of time. This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie. Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either. No way I will be ever seeing this one again! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

There was a showing of a new 35mm print of the film, and a post discussion with Elliott, Tom Skerritt, and the wife of Mr. Altman. I even have a signed poster! Excellent film, easily watchable again and again. And, the P.A. announcements are so very funny! ********** (10 Out of 10 Stars)

    The film MASH opens with the arrival of Captain Pierce and Duke Forrest in an army field hospital as sergeants during the Korean War and ends with their departure. And in between we have the life of men and women in the camp. There are little pieces of stories and incidents we get to know about, some of them are funny, some disgusting and some empty. It's very difficult to talk about the film, not because it's obscure but because it is vastly pointless. It becomes quite clear that Robert Altman tried his best to make a film out of these little pieces, and that is probably the biggest drawback of the film - his effort shows. I won't blame Jean Luc Godard for not being able to tell a story the way it should be told, because his intentions were never to do so. He can be criticized for what he tried not for what he didn't. But unfortunately, Altman's success or failure in MASH should be judged in terms of these stories through which he tries to get inside this Army field hospital and of course the way he puts it. Looking back at a film like MASH made around 40 years ago, it is quite difficult to figure out the reasons behind its popularity, and hey, it's far from experimental too. The question is what is the film then? What is it about? Well, it's kind of a comedy which doesn't make you laugh that much. It's kind of an anti-war film that doesn't have much to say against war. It's kind of a psychological endeavor that doesn't penetrate. The film, MASH, is careless and indiscipline one, very much like the characters it depicts. MASH is probably a satirical, bit circus tic, black and bleak comedy  mostly ineffective. I think MASH is a war film that, fortunately, has nothing to do with heroism, bravery, patriotism or honor  instead it's about sadism, cruelty, cowardice and utter stupidity. I feel sad at the end of the film precisely because of its inability to take this influential project further. It fails to build up the characters it portrays. We are never at home with them; we don't know how to react. These characters never grow; they provide us no reason to follow them. Think about the football match sequence, all of a sudden we have a football match coming up from nowhere, and that too an elaborated coverage, the whole thing was absolutely rubbish and the film could have been better without it. Think about the suicide drama, think about the Korean boy they all seem stories out of place - we don't know them; we aren't linked. There are certain things that I find very disgusting too, for example, the way the film portrays the female character, hot lips. She arrives in the camp with a mission; she finds the whole atmosphere in the camp very messy and unorganized. She talks about discipline and order, and throughout the rest of the film she is mocked by everyone. She almost becomes a ridiculous and stupid creature, readily available for everything. She only finds Frank, but even Frank is forced to leave the field hospital by Captain Pierce and others. Hot lips' privacy is badly hampered twice, once when she is having sex with Frank, someone puts the microphone inside the room, and the whole hospital gets to hear the sounds. Secondly, all the temporary curtains were taken off while she is taking a bath, and she is exposed fully in front of everybody seated outside, with even musical instruments, a gallant show of laughter and disdain, and a worst possible part of the film for me. She is further ridiculed when she goes to the room of the officer in charge or whatever to complain about all these, we see her absolutely unable to make her point being angry and ends up shouting and crying, saying nothing. She is ridiculous, vague, overtly emotional and probably stretched as far as someone crazy. I don't know what Robert Altman wanted to achieve by all these, cruelty, disrespect, irresponsibility, perversion, voyeurism of these people in the military field hospital? May be, but since his whole project is a failure, at the end, it seems a perversion on the part of the director and nothing else. Hey, MASH won one of the most prestigious film awards of all, the P'lm Dore at the Cannes film festival in 1970, something it doesn't deserve, really.

    There was so much pain after that war. Most of you commenting weren't even born yet and you don't know the turmoil the media constantly thrust at the American public trying to get ratings and using the networks for political agendas mostly condemning the war. America was more naive and gullible and not as jaded as they are now. In a very tangible way every week and right in front of them on their TV screens was a way to draw the whole country back together in MASH. Whether you were for or against the war it made the soldiers who fought in the war more real and more human. They had faults.. some of them were terrible faults and some of them had wonderful strengths but America had suffered enough and it was time to laugh and get on with life. It wasn't a show that could work before that time or after that time but during that time MASH because a way for people to feel more normal about surviving that part of American history. Laughter is good medicine. There are many many comedic tactics considered genius in their time that audiences no longer respond to now in any way. When you watch these older movies and television series you have to understand the context in which they were created and what their audience needed from that project at that time.

    Finally got around to watching (skimming through is more likely) the movie M*A*S*H. It was a popular TV show in the 70's and even my parents talked about watching the movie version when it was first released. But I was absolutely horrified and disgusted by its cynicism and callousness. There was no plot to the movie at all, and it wasn't funny. Donald Southerland is the farthest from being a funny actor, although he's not a big mouth like Alan Alda. Anybody wishing to be a medical doctor would be disillusioned by the seeming purposelessness of the surgeons working in a mobile army surgical hospital during the Korean War. Furthermore, the lyrics of the opening song shocked me: "suicide is painless. And I can take or leave it if I please." I would understand if these words came out of the mouths of desperate wounded soldiers, but they are not suitable for a drama about army surgeons. In addition, the movie pretends the characters were living in America; there is no mention about Korea even though it takes place in Korea during the terrible tragedies of the Korean War.

    I saw M*A*S*H with my mom when I was eight years old when it was first released in 1970. It was held over, when movie theaters would hold over films that made a lot of money. It was made for an estimated budget of 3.5 million dollars. It made 81 million in revenue, it was a big hit in those days. It was a milestone for Robert Altman, and put him on the map as a director. I was only eight but enjoyed the humor and the sexuality was more implied than graphic. Two years later when the series premiered on CBS, I readily tuned in to see how it compared to the film. It was a TV standards and practices marvel, in that CBS tried to get across the subversive point across as much as they could on a TV sitcom. Being a series of vignettes rather than a chronological film, it showed a new way to film movies. It was movie making genius then, and still holds up to scrutiny today.

    I only enjoyed the wits, dialogs & some dirty jokes by Sutherland. That's all. Other than the funny part, the screenplay is quite good, writing is fresh & the music (Suicide Is Painless) amazed me. MASH is an out-dated comedy weaker than Animal House. The plot or story isn't that great to follow. The characters take you for some jokes & comic thrills here and there. Those are the only points where you will enjoy this movie NOW in the YOLO generation. I don't know how it won the Golden Palm, but this is not my cup of war tea. For crying out loud, an average 5/10. BOTTOM LINE: This is not a classic as they (Wikipedia) say(s), but a sure one-time watch unless war comedies related to misogyny & lots of female nudity bore the hell out of you. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Language: No | Sex: Strong | Nudity: Very Strong | Mouth-Kiss, Foreplay: Strong | Violence: Mild | Gore: Infinity | Smoking: No | Alcohol, Drugs: Strong

    M*A*S*H* is a terrific movie with a great storyline,a fantastic and talented cast,plenty of hilarious scenes and some serious drama.The movie has made a terrific legacy for itself,a series of the same name was made two years later,and it ran for eleven years.I think the show is a lot better,its much funnier,more light hearted and much less violence.The cast of this movie is terrific,I think the best actor was Elliot Gould,because I found his character Trapper John McIntyre to be the funniest and stood out the most out of all of them,I also enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Tom Skerritt. A staff working in a field hospital during a Korean War use there humor and laughter to make them forget about the violence and horror of the war they are facing.

    When I first saw "Mash" back in 1970 or thereabouts I was certain that it was a masterpiece of filmmaking. Over the years, I've had occasion to see it several more times, and each time it's diminished a bit. It's obvious that the movie only masquerades as being about "Korea", this is about Viet Nam. In that light it's interesting that the humor seemed much easier to accept while the war in Viet Nam was still playing in our living rooms every night. It was irreverent and "in-your-face", but a viable counterpoint to the horror of what was actually going on in S.E. Asia. Since the war is - thankfully - long since over, the humor now seems simply mean-spirited and thoughtless.And Hawkeye and Trapper are simple smart-ass jerks. There's little noteworthy outside of the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper. Radar is pleasant enough, Hotlips and Frank Burns are just uncomfortable to watch. The rest is simply wallpaper. I guess my conclusion is that this was a movie for the moment. It doesn't hold up well now with 40 years of history under the bridge.

    No idea why this movie is considered to be a genre classic really. I don't know, perhaps I needed to be around at 1970 to fully understand its appeal and appreciate it, since it certainly was a popular movie at the time, that even had an even more successful TV-series following it up, only 2 years later. Thing that the movie is known and praised for, is its heavy anti-war message in it. Well, not a message really but it makes a statement by turning a war situation into something comical. Perhaps this was something that really spoke to people at the time because of America's involved with the Vietnam war. In that regard, this movie is perhaps being a bit too much a product of its time and has lost it relevance and impact. But that does not make a bad movie of course. What does make this movie quite bad is that it simply isn't very fun or funny to watch at all. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I chuckled just once. The rest of the movie mostly consists out of people talking over each other and behaving incredibly immature. This was another real problem I had with this movie; All of the characters behaved like a bunch of brats and really not one of them was being likable enough for me. This was perhaps the biggest reason why I just couldn't ever enjoy watching this movie. But really, another big problem of the movie for me was that it didn't even featured a main story in it. It made this movie come across as a real pointless one, that was never being good, interesting or funny enough. It just isn't going anywhere with any of it. Perhaps it was to show the whole pointlessness of war but this doesn't make the movie any more pleasant or good to follow. Maybe it would had also helped if the movie did actually showed some of its war but now I really never had the feeling as if the movie was taking place during a war situation. The cast-list sound interesting, with people such as Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall and Rene Auberjonois in it but most of them were still pretty big unknowns at the time and their roles also aren't all that big. The movie doesn't have one main character in it but it instead focuses on a whole bunch of them, for an equal amount of time. This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie. Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either. No way I will be ever seeing this one again! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One Of The Greatest Films And Comedies Of Ever Made. An Excellent And Hilarious Classic Black Comedy War Film. Robert Altman At His Best.

    MASH is one of the greatest Comedies Of all time and a classic film that combines amazing direction,a fantastic ensemble cast,hilarious Black Comedy,wonderful script and a memorable film score making MASH one of Altman's best and a classic Comedy and War Film and not only one of the best films of the 1970s but one of the greatest films ever made. Based on the novel MASH:A Novel About Three Army Doctors and set during the Korean War in the early 1950s,MASH tells the story of a group of Army surgeons that includes Capt. Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),Trapper John McIntyre(Elliot Gould)and Duke Forrest(Tom Skerritt)that work inside a hospital and deal with Horrors of the War while getting into hilarious situations and misadventures. Before MASH was turned into the iconic and popular television series of the same name,MASH was an amazing,hilarious and edgy Black Comedy classic that was an Anti-War Satire and was also a cinema breakthrough for filmmaker Robert Altman and is a film that ranks with other great films and Black Comedies Dr Strangelove and Network and is one of the film that gave birth to the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s. One of the reasons MASH is a classic film is because Robert Altman takes the concept and subject of War and makes an Anti-War film that mocks the military and Wars in a funny and Satirical way that is bold and brave and at the same time creative and subversive in a original style. The Comedy and laughs in MASH is funny and hilarious and is done with in darkly Humorous way with scenes and dialog in the film that is smart and intelligent and can only exist in the bizarre and insane world of MASH that is truly wacky and offbeat and done with a weirdness and insane energy that never slows down or lets up until the very end and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I also love that The Comedy is politically incorrect and is the kind of Humor that you don't really see in films anymore and would offend viewers in today's world. What I also love about MASH is the episodic nature and structure of the film where there are scenes in the movie that jump from one to the next and some of the characters pop in and out of the narrative but the film is never disjointed or disconnected and I think the episodic style keeps the film moving at a great pace. While the film is set during the Korean War in the 1950s,MASH is more about the Vietnam War that was going on in the during the 1960s and 70s and Altman doesn't hold back in showing the danger and Horrors of going to War especially during the Hospital and surgery scenes which are done in a gritty and realistic way almost like a documentary of Surgery in Hospitals during a War. MASH is a Comedy and it is very funny but it's still an Anti-War film that is told from a cynical point of view that is harsh and unflinching. The three main characters in the film Hawkeye Pierce,Trapper John McIntyre and Duke Forrest are great and truly memorable characters because when you look at the characters you feel like that even though they are surgeons of War they don't really want to be in the War or military but rather in a bar drinking a small glass of martini,flirting with women or being at home and not participating in the War. The many scenes with Hawkeye and Trapper or the scenes the three main characters have together is funny and wonderful with the characters Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke saying memorable dialog that is very fresh,sarcastic and witty as well. Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke are three amazing characters you will never forget. The screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. is wonderful and well-written even much of the dialog was improvised by the cast and there's a lot of scenes of overlapping dialog between the main characters that is great and would become one of the many trademarks of Altman's films. The final 20-30 minutes and the film's ending is amazing and matches the rest of the film's manic comic energy. A great ending. The whole cast is wonderful. Donald Sutherland is excellent and hilarious as Captain Hawkeye Pierce,with Sutherland bringing laughs and coolness to the role. Elliot Gould is brilliant and funny as Captain Trapper John McIntyre and has great scenes with Sutherland. Tom Skerritt is amazing as Duke Forrest,Hawkeye and Trapper's friend. Sally Kellerman is fantastic as Major Hot Lips O'Houlihan,a straight laced nurse. Robert Duvall is wonderful as Major Frank Burns,an fellow Army Surgeon. Roger Bowen is terrific as Colonial Henry Blake,a man who's in charge of the MASH unit. Gary Burghoff is great as Corporal Radar,Blake right hand man. Burghoff also played the role on the television series. David Arkin is funny as Sgt. Major Vollmer,a by the book soldier. Jo Ann Plug is sensational and beautiful as Lt. Dish,Hawkeye's love interest. Fred Williamson is outstanding as Dr. Spearchucker Jones,a Football player who's now a surgeon. Michael Murphy is great as Me Lai Larston,a Surgeon in Japan. John Schuck is fantastic as Capt. Painless Waldowski,a dentist. G. Wood(General Hammond),Bud Cort(Private Boone)and Rene Auberjonois(Father John 'Dago Red' Mulcahy)give good performances as well. The direction by Robert Altman is brilliant,with Altman always moving the camera with zooms and close ups and giving the film a gritty and realistic look. Great direction by Altman. The score by Johnny Mandel is fantastic and memorable and brings a light and fun feeling to the film. I also love the classic theme song Suicide Is Painless that is used for the film(and later for the television series)and it truly matches the film's tone. In final word,if you love Robert Altman,Comedies,Black Comedies,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see MASH,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    To me, Altman's second-best film, behind "Nashville," which is so uniquely brilliant, it defies classification! Regardless of it being set during the Korean War, this is obviously a commentary on the insanity of the current-at-that-time Vietnam War, and of war in general. The surgeons are endlessly patching up the badly wounded, and they keep coming. The endless cycle leads to the surgeons and other personnel just trying to keep sane. There is quite of mix of gore and laughs as the characters make their way through the conflict. And, surreal moments that transcend it all. Altman was a master at breaking the rules, and has a dream cast that makes the film perfect. I saw this at the 75th Anniversary for 20th Century Fox at Lincoln Center in 2010. I got to meet and have a real conversation with Elliott Gould, easily the best interaction with a celebrity I have ever had. There was a showing of a new 35mm print of the film, and a post discussion with Elliott, Tom Skerritt, and the wife of Mr. Altman. I even have a signed poster! Excellent film, easily watchable again and again. And, the P.A. announcements are so very funny! ********** (10 Out of 10 Stars)

Hey, MASH won one of the most prestigious film awards of all, the P'lm Dore at the Cannes film festival in 1970, something it doesn't deserve, really.

The plot or story isn't that great to follow. The characters take you for some jokes & comic thrills here and there. Those are the only points where you will enjoy this movie NOW in the YOLO generation. I don't know how it won the Golden Palm, but this is not my cup of war tea. For crying out loud, an average 5/10. BOTTOM LINE: This is not a classic as they (Wikipedia) say(s), but a sure one-time watch unless war comedies related to misogyny & lots of female nudity bore the hell out of you. Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

    M*A*S*H* is a terrific movie with a great storyline,a fantastic and talented cast,plenty of hilarious scenes and some serious drama.The movie has made a terrific legacy for itself,a series of the same name was made two years later,and it ran for eleven years.I think the show is a lot better,its much funnier,more light hearted and much less violence.The cast of this movie is terrific,I think the best actor was Elliot Gould,because I found his character Trapper John McIntyre to be the funniest and stood out the most out of all of them,I also enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Tom Skerritt. A staff working in a field hospital during a Korean War use there humor and laughter to make them forget about the violence and horror of the war they are facing.

    When I first saw "Mash" back in 1970 or thereabouts I was certain that it was a masterpiece of filmmaking. Over the years, I've had occasion to see it several more times, and each time it's diminished a bit. It's obvious that the movie only masquerades as being about "Korea", this is about Viet Nam. In that light it's interesting that the humor seemed much easier to accept while the war in Viet Nam was still playing in our living rooms every night. It was irreverent and "in-your-face", but a viable counterpoint to the horror of what was actually going on in S.E. Asia. Since the war is - thankfully - long since over, the humor now seems simply mean-spirited and thoughtless.And Hawkeye and Trapper are simple smart-ass jerks. There's little noteworthy outside of the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper. Radar is pleasant enough, Hotlips and Frank Burns are just uncomfortable to watch. The rest is simply wallpaper. I guess my conclusion is that this was a movie for the moment. It doesn't hold up well now with 40 years of history under the bridge.

    No idea why this movie is considered to be a genre classic really. I don't know, perhaps I needed to be around at 1970 to fully understand its appeal and appreciate it, since it certainly was a popular movie at the time, that even had an even more successful TV-series following it up, only 2 years later. Thing that the movie is known and praised for, is its heavy anti-war message in it. Well, not a message really but it makes a statement by turning a war situation into something comical. Perhaps this was something that really spoke to people at the time because of America's involved with the Vietnam war. In that regard, this movie is perhaps being a bit too much a product of its time and has lost it relevance and impact. But that does not make a bad movie of course. What does make this movie quite bad is that it simply isn't very fun or funny to watch at all. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I chuckled just once. The rest of the movie mostly consists out of people talking over each other and behaving incredibly immature. This was another real problem I had with this movie; All of the characters behaved like a bunch of brats and really not one of them was being likable enough for me. This was perhaps the biggest reason why I just couldn't ever enjoy watching this movie. But really, another big problem of the movie for me was that it didn't even featured a main story in it. It made this movie come across as a real pointless one, that was never being good, interesting or funny enough. It just isn't going anywhere with any of it. Perhaps it was to show the whole pointlessness of war but this doesn't make the movie any more pleasant or good to follow. Maybe it would had also helped if the movie did actually showed some of its war but now I really never had the feeling as if the movie was taking place during a war situation. The cast-list sound interesting, with people such as Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall and Rene Auberjonois in it but most of them were still pretty big unknowns at the time and their roles also aren't all that big. The movie doesn't have one main character in it but it instead focuses on a whole bunch of them, for an equal amount of time. This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie. Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either. No way I will be ever seeing this one again! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One Of The Greatest Films And Comedies Of Ever Made. An Excellent And Hilarious Classic Black Comedy War Film. Robert Altman At His Best.

    MASH is one of the greatest Comedies Of all time and a classic film that combines amazing direction,a fantastic ensemble cast,hilarious Black Comedy,wonderful script and a memorable film score making MASH one of Altman's best and a classic Comedy and War Film and not only one of the best films of the 1970s but one of the greatest films ever made. Based on the novel MASH:A Novel About Three Army Doctors and set during the Korean War in the early 1950s,MASH tells the story of a group of Army surgeons that includes Capt. Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),Trapper John McIntyre(Elliot Gould)and Duke Forrest(Tom Skerritt)that work inside a hospital and deal with Horrors of the War while getting into hilarious situations and misadventures. Before MASH was turned into the iconic and popular television series of the same name,MASH was an amazing,hilarious and edgy Black Comedy classic that was an Anti-War Satire and was also a cinema breakthrough for filmmaker Robert Altman and is a film that ranks with other great films and Black Comedies Dr Strangelove and Network and is one of the film that gave birth to the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s. One of the reasons MASH is a classic film is because Robert Altman takes the concept and subject of War and makes an Anti-War film that mocks the military and Wars in a funny and Satirical way that is bold and brave and at the same time creative and subversive in a original style. The Comedy and laughs in MASH is funny and hilarious and is done with in darkly Humorous way with scenes and dialog in the film that is smart and intelligent and can only exist in the bizarre and insane world of MASH that is truly wacky and offbeat and done with a weirdness and insane energy that never slows down or lets up until the very end and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I also love that The Comedy is politically incorrect and is the kind of Humor that you don't really see in films anymore and would offend viewers in today's world. What I also love about MASH is the episodic nature and structure of the film where there are scenes in the movie that jump from one to the next and some of the characters pop in and out of the narrative but the film is never disjointed or disconnected and I think the episodic style keeps the film moving at a great pace. While the film is set during the Korean War in the 1950s,MASH is more about the Vietnam War that was going on in the during the 1960s and 70s and Altman doesn't hold back in showing the danger and Horrors of going to War especially during the Hospital and surgery scenes which are done in a gritty and realistic way almost like a documentary of Surgery in Hospitals during a War. MASH is a Comedy and it is very funny but it's still an Anti-War film that is told from a cynical point of view that is harsh and unflinching. The three main characters in the film Hawkeye Pierce,Trapper John McIntyre and Duke Forrest are great and truly memorable characters because when you look at the characters you feel like that even though they are surgeons of War they don't really want to be in the War or military but rather in a bar drinking a small glass of martini,flirting with women or being at home and not participating in the War. The many scenes with Hawkeye and Trapper or the scenes the three main characters have together is funny and wonderful with the characters Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke saying memorable dialog that is very fresh,sarcastic and witty as well. Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke are three amazing characters you will never forget. The screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. is wonderful and well-written even much of the dialog was improvised by the cast and there's a lot of scenes of overlapping dialog between the main characters that is great and would become one of the many trademarks of Altman's films. The final 20-30 minutes and the film's ending is amazing and matches the rest of the film's manic comic energy. A great ending. The whole cast is wonderful. Donald Sutherland is excellent and hilarious as Captain Hawkeye Pierce,with Sutherland bringing laughs and coolness to the role. Elliot Gould is brilliant and funny as Captain Trapper John McIntyre and has great scenes with Sutherland. Tom Skerritt is amazing as Duke Forrest,Hawkeye and Trapper's friend. Sally Kellerman is fantastic as Major Hot Lips O'Houlihan,a straight laced nurse. Robert Duvall is wonderful as Major Frank Burns,an fellow Army Surgeon. Roger Bowen is terrific as Colonial Henry Blake,a man who's in charge of the MASH unit. Gary Burghoff is great as Corporal Radar,Blake right hand man. Burghoff also played the role on the television series. David Arkin is funny as Sgt. Major Vollmer,a by the book soldier. Jo Ann Plug is sensational and beautiful as Lt. Dish,Hawkeye's love interest. Fred Williamson is outstanding as Dr. Spearchucker Jones,a Football player who's now a surgeon. Michael Murphy is great as Me Lai Larston,a Surgeon in Japan. John Schuck is fantastic as Capt. Painless Waldowski,a dentist. G. Wood(General Hammond),Bud Cort(Private Boone)and Rene Auberjonois(Father John 'Dago Red' Mulcahy)give good performances as well. The direction by Robert Altman is brilliant,with Altman always moving the camera with zooms and close ups and giving the film a gritty and realistic look. Great direction by Altman. The score by Johnny Mandel is fantastic and memorable and brings a light and fun feeling to the film. I also love the classic theme song Suicide Is Painless that is used for the film(and later for the television series)and it truly matches the film's tone. In final word,if you love Robert Altman,Comedies,Black Comedies,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see MASH,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    To me, Altman's second-best film, behind "Nashville," which is so uniquely brilliant, it defies classification! Regardless of it being set during the Korean War, this is obviously a commentary on the insanity of the current-at-that-time Vietnam War, and of war in general. The surgeons are endlessly patching up the badly wounded, and they keep coming. The endless cycle leads to the surgeons and other personnel just trying to keep sane. There is quite of mix of gore and laughs as the characters make their way through the conflict. And, surreal moments that transcend it all. Altman was a master at breaking the rules, and has a dream cast that makes the film perfect. I saw this at the 75th Anniversary for 20th Century Fox at Lincoln Center in 2010. I got to meet and have a real conversation with Elliott Gould, easily the best interaction with a celebrity I have ever had. There was a showing of a new 35mm print of the film, and a post discussion with Elliott, Tom Skerritt, and the wife of Mr. Altman. I even have a signed poster! Excellent film, easily watchable again and again. And, the P.A. announcements are so very funny! ********** (10 Out of 10 Stars)

    The film MASH opens with the arrival of Captain Pierce and Duke Forrest in an army field hospital as sergeants during the Korean War and ends with their departure. And in between we have the life of men and women in the camp. There are little pieces of stories and incidents we get to know about, some of them are funny, some disgusting and some empty. It's very difficult to talk about the film, not because it's obscure but because it is vastly pointless. It becomes quite clear that Robert Altman tried his best to make a film out of these little pieces, and that is probably the biggest drawback of the film - his effort shows. I won't blame Jean Luc Godard for not being able to tell a story the way it should be told, because his intentions were never to do so. He can be criticized for what he tried not for what he didn't. But unfortunately, Altman's success or failure in MASH should be judged in terms of these stories through which he tries to get inside this Army field hospital and of course the way he puts it. Looking back at a film like MASH made around 40 years ago, it is quite difficult to figure out the reasons behind its popularity, and hey, it's far from experimental too. The question is what is the film then? What is it about? Well, it's kind of a comedy which doesn't make you laugh that much. It's kind of an anti-war film that doesn't have much to say against war. It's kind of a psychological endeavor that doesn't penetrate. The film, MASH, is careless and indiscipline one, very much like the characters it depicts. MASH is probably a satirical, bit circus tic, black and bleak comedy  mostly ineffective. I think MASH is a war film that, fortunately, has nothing to do with heroism, bravery, patriotism or honor  instead it's about sadism, cruelty, cowardice and utter stupidity. I feel sad at the end of the film precisely because of its inability to take this influential project further. It fails to build up the characters it portrays. We are never at home with them; we don't know how to react. These characters never grow; they provide us no reason to follow them. Think about the football match sequence, all of a sudden we have a football match coming up from nowhere, and that too an elaborated coverage, the whole thing was absolutely rubbish and the film could have been better without it. Think about the suicide drama, think about the Korean boy they all seem stories out of place - we don't know them; we aren't linked. There are certain things that I find very disgusting too, for example, the way the film portrays the female character, hot lips. She arrives in the camp with a mission; she finds the whole atmosphere in the camp very messy and unorganized. She talks about discipline and order, and throughout the rest of the film she is mocked by everyone. She almost becomes a ridiculous and stupid creature, readily available for everything. She only finds Frank, but even Frank is forced to leave the field hospital by Captain Pierce and others. Hot lips' privacy is badly hampered twice, once when she is having sex with Frank, someone puts the microphone inside the room, and the whole hospital gets to hear the sounds. Secondly, all the temporary curtains were taken off while she is taking a bath, and she is exposed fully in front of everybody seated outside, with even musical instruments, a gallant show of laughter and disdain, and a worst possible part of the film for me. She is further ridiculed when she goes to the room of the officer in charge or whatever to complain about all these, we see her absolutely unable to make her point being angry and ends up shouting and crying, saying nothing. She is ridiculous, vague, overtly emotional and probably stretched as far as someone crazy. I don't know what Robert Altman wanted to achieve by all these, cruelty, disrespect, irresponsibility, perversion, voyeurism of these people in the military field hospital? May be, but since his whole project is a failure, at the end, it seems a perversion on the part of the director and nothing else. Hey, MASH won one of the most prestigious film awards of all, the P'lm Dore at the Cannes film festival in 1970, something it doesn't deserve, really.

    There was so much pain after that war. Most of you commenting weren't even born yet and you don't know the turmoil the media constantly thrust at the American public trying to get ratings and using the networks for political agendas mostly condemning the war. America was more naive and gullible and not as jaded as they are now. In a very tangible way every week and right in front of them on their TV screens was a way to draw the whole country back together in MASH. Whether you were for or against the war it made the soldiers who fought in the war more real and more human. They had faults.. some of them were terrible faults and some of them had wonderful strengths but America had suffered enough and it was time to laugh and get on with life. It wasn't a show that could work before that time or after that time but during that time MASH because a way for people to feel more normal about surviving that part of American history. Laughter is good medicine. There are many many comedic tactics considered genius in their time that audiences no longer respond to now in any way. When you watch these older movies and television series you have to understand the context in which they were created and what their audience needed from that project at that time.

    Finally got around to watching (skimming through is more likely) the movie M*A*S*H. It was a popular TV show in the 70's and even my parents talked about watching the movie version when it was first released. But I was absolutely horrified and disgusted by its cynicism and callousness. There was no plot to the movie at all, and it wasn't funny. Donald Southerland is the farthest from being a funny actor, although he's not a big mouth like Alan Alda. Anybody wishing to be a medical doctor would be disillusioned by the seeming purposelessness of the surgeons working in a mobile army surgical hospital during the Korean War. Furthermore, the lyrics of the opening song shocked me: "suicide is painless. And I can take or leave it if I please." I would understand if these words came out of the mouths of desperate wounded soldiers, but they are not suitable for a drama about army surgeons. In addition, the movie pretends the characters were living in America; there is no mention about Korea even though it takes place in Korea during the terrible tragedies of the Korean War.

    I saw M*A*S*H with my mom when I was eight years old when it was first released in 1970. It was held over, when movie theaters would hold over films that made a lot of money. It was made for an estimated budget of 3.5 million dollars. It made 81 million in revenue, it was a big hit in those days. It was a milestone for Robert Altman, and put him on the map as a director. I was only eight but enjoyed the humor and the sexuality was more implied than graphic. Two years later when the series premiered on CBS, I readily tuned in to see how it compared to the film. It was a TV standards and practices marvel, in that CBS tried to get across the subversive point across as much as they could on a TV sitcom. Being a series of vignettes rather than a chronological film, it showed a new way to film movies. It was movie making genius then, and still holds up to scrutiny today.

The many scenes with Hawkeye and Trapper or the scenes the three main characters have together is funny and wonderful with the characters Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke saying memorable dialog that is very fresh,sarcastic and witty as well. Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke are three amazing characters you will never forget. The screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. is wonderful and well-written even much of the dialog was improvised by the cast and there's a lot of scenes of overlapping dialog between the main characters that is great and would become one of the many trademarks of Altman's films. The final 20-30 minutes and the film's ending is amazing and matches the rest of the film's manic comic energy. A great ending. The whole cast is wonderful. Donald Sutherland is excellent and hilarious as Captain Hawkeye Pierce,with Sutherland bringing laughs and coolness to the role. Elliot Gould is brilliant and funny as Captain Trapper John McIntyre and has great scenes with Sutherland. Tom Skerritt is amazing as Duke Forrest,Hawkeye and Trapper's friend. Sally Kellerman is fantastic as Major Hot Lips O'Houlihan,a straight laced nurse. Robert Duvall is wonderful as Major Frank Burns,an fellow Army Surgeon. Roger Bowen is terrific as Colonial Henry Blake,a man who's in charge of the MASH unit. Gary Burghoff is great as Corporal Radar,Blake right hand man. Burghoff also played the role on the television series. David Arkin is funny as Sgt. Major Vollmer,a by the book soldier. Jo Ann Plug is sensational and beautiful as Lt. Dish,Hawkeye's love interest. Fred Williamson is outstanding as Dr. Spearchucker Jones,a Football player who's now a surgeon. Michael Murphy is great as Me Lai Larston,a Surgeon in Japan. John Schuck is fantastic as Capt. Painless Waldowski,a dentist. G. Wood(General Hammond),Bud Cort(Private Boone)and Rene Auberjonois(Father John 'Dago Red' Mulcahy)give good performances as well. The direction by Robert Altman is brilliant,with Altman always moving the camera with zooms and close ups and giving the film a gritty and realistic look. Great direction by Altman. The score by Johnny Mandel is fantastic and memorable and brings a light and fun feeling to the film. I also love the classic theme song Suicide Is Painless that is used for the film(and later for the television series)and it truly matches the film's tone. In final word,if you love Robert Altman,Comedies,Black Comedies,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see MASH,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    To me, Altman's second-best film, behind "Nashville," which is so uniquely brilliant, it defies classification! Regardless of it being set during the Korean War, this is obviously a commentary on the insanity of the current-at-that-time Vietnam War, and of war in general. The surgeons are endlessly patching up the badly wounded, and they keep coming. The endless cycle leads to the surgeons and other personnel just trying to keep sane. There is quite of mix of gore and laughs as the characters make their way through the conflict. And, surreal moments that transcend it all. Altman was a master at breaking the rules, and has a dream cast that makes the film perfect. I saw this at the 75th Anniversary for 20th Century Fox at Lincoln Center in 2010. I got to meet and have a real conversation with Elliott Gould, easily the best interaction with a celebrity I have ever had. There was a showing of a new 35mm print of the film, and a post discussion with Elliott, Tom Skerritt, and the wife of Mr. Altman. I even have a signed poster! Excellent film, easily watchable again and again. And, the P.A. announcements are so very funny! ********** (10 Out of 10 Stars)

    The film MASH opens with the arrival of Captain Pierce and Duke Forrest in an army field hospital as sergeants during the Korean War and ends with their departure. And in between we have the life of men and women in the camp. There are little pieces of stories and incidents we get to know about, some of them are funny, some disgusting and some empty. It's very difficult to talk about the film, not because it's obscure but because it is vastly pointless. It becomes quite clear that Robert Altman tried his best to make a film out of these little pieces, and that is probably the biggest drawback of the film - his effort shows. I won't blame Jean Luc Godard for not being able to tell a story the way it should be told, because his intentions were never to do so. He can be criticized for what he tried not for what he didn't. But unfortunately, Altman's success or failure in MASH should be judged in terms of these stories through which he tries to get inside this Army field hospital and of course the way he puts it. Looking back at a film like MASH made around 40 years ago, it is quite difficult to figure out the reasons behind its popularity, and hey, it's far from experimental too. The question is what is the film then? What is it about? Well, it's kind of a comedy which doesn't make you laugh that much. It's kind of an anti-war film that doesn't have much to say against war. It's kind of a psychological endeavor that doesn't penetrate. The film, MASH, is careless and indiscipline one, very much like the characters it depicts. MASH is probably a satirical, bit circus tic, black and bleak comedy  mostly ineffective. I think MASH is a war film that, fortunately, has nothing to do with heroism, bravery, patriotism or honor  instead it's about sadism, cruelty, cowardice and utter stupidity. I feel sad at the end of the film precisely because of its inability to take this influential project further. It fails to build up the characters it portrays. We are never at home with them; we don't know how to react. These characters never grow; they provide us no reason to follow them. Think about the football match sequence, all of a sudden we have a football match coming up from nowhere, and that too an elaborated coverage, the whole thing was absolutely rubbish and the film could have been better without it. Think about the suicide drama, think about the Korean boy they all seem stories out of place - we don't know them; we aren't linked. There are certain things that I find very disgusting too, for example, the way the film portrays the female character, hot lips. She arrives in the camp with a mission; she finds the whole atmosphere in the camp very messy and unorganized. She talks about discipline and order, and throughout the rest of the film she is mocked by everyone. She almost becomes a ridiculous and stupid creature, readily available for everything. She only finds Frank, but even Frank is forced to leave the field hospital by Captain Pierce and others. Hot lips' privacy is badly hampered twice, once when she is having sex with Frank, someone puts the microphone inside the room, and the whole hospital gets to hear the sounds. Secondly, all the temporary curtains were taken off while she is taking a bath, and she is exposed fully in front of everybody seated outside, with even musical instruments, a gallant show of laughter and disdain, and a worst possible part of the film for me. She is further ridiculed when she goes to the room of the officer in charge or whatever to complain about all these, we see her absolutely unable to make her point being angry and ends up shouting and crying, saying nothing. She is ridiculous, vague, overtly emotional and probably stretched as far as someone crazy. I don't know what Robert Altman wanted to achieve by all these, cruelty, disrespect, irresponsibility, perversion, voyeurism of these people in the military field hospital? May be, but since his whole project is a failure, at the end, it seems a perversion on the part of the director and nothing else. Hey, MASH won one of the most prestigious film awards of all, the P'lm Dore at the Cannes film festival in 1970, something it doesn't deserve, really.

    There was so much pain after that war. Most of you commenting weren't even born yet and you don't know the turmoil the media constantly thrust at the American public trying to get ratings and using the networks for political agendas mostly condemning the war. America was more naive and gullible and not as jaded as they are now. In a very tangible way every week and right in front of them on their TV screens was a way to draw the whole country back together in MASH. Whether you were for or against the war it made the soldiers who fought in the war more real and more human. They had faults.. some of them were terrible faults and some of them had wonderful strengths but America had suffered enough and it was time to laugh and get on with life. It wasn't a show that could work before that time or after that time but during that time MASH because a way for people to feel more normal about surviving that part of American history. Laughter is good medicine. There are many many comedic tactics considered genius in their time that audiences no longer respond to now in any way. When you watch these older movies and television series you have to understand the context in which they were created and what their audience needed from that project at that time.

    Finally got around to watching (skimming through is more likely) the movie M*A*S*H. It was a popular TV show in the 70's and even my parents talked about watching the movie version when it was first released. But I was absolutely horrified and disgusted by its cynicism and callousness. There was no plot to the movie at all, and it wasn't funny. Donald Southerland is the farthest from being a funny actor, although he's not a big mouth like Alan Alda. Anybody wishing to be a medical doctor would be disillusioned by the seeming purposelessness of the surgeons working in a mobile army surgical hospital during the Korean War. Furthermore, the lyrics of the opening song shocked me: "suicide is painless. And I can take or leave it if I please." I would understand if these words came out of the mouths of desperate wounded soldiers, but they are not suitable for a drama about army surgeons. In addition, the movie pretends the characters were living in America; there is no mention about Korea even though it takes place in Korea during the terrible tragedies of the Korean War.

    I saw M*A*S*H with my mom when I was eight years old when it was first released in 1970. It was held over, when movie theaters would hold over films that made a lot of money. It was made for an estimated budget of 3.5 million dollars. It made 81 million in revenue, it was a big hit in those days. It was a milestone for Robert Altman, and put him on the map as a director. I was only eight but enjoyed the humor and the sexuality was more implied than graphic. Two years later when the series premiered on CBS, I readily tuned in to see how it compared to the film. It was a TV standards and practices marvel, in that CBS tried to get across the subversive point across as much as they could on a TV sitcom. Being a series of vignettes rather than a chronological film, it showed a new way to film movies. It was movie making genius then, and still holds up to scrutiny today.

    I only enjoyed the wits, dialogs & some dirty jokes by Sutherland. That's all. Other than the funny part, the screenplay is quite good, writing is fresh & the music (Suicide Is Painless) amazed me. MASH is an out-dated comedy weaker than Animal House. The plot or story isn't that great to follow. The characters take you for some jokes & comic thrills here and there. Those are the only points where you will enjoy this movie NOW in the YOLO generation. I don't know how it won the Golden Palm, but this is not my cup of war tea. For crying out loud, an average 5/10. BOTTOM LINE: This is not a classic as they (Wikipedia) say(s), but a sure one-time watch unless war comedies related to misogyny & lots of female nudity bore the hell out of you. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Language: No | Sex: Strong | Nudity: Very Strong | Mouth-Kiss, Foreplay: Strong | Violence: Mild | Gore: Infinity | Smoking: No | Alcohol, Drugs: Strong

    M*A*S*H* is a terrific movie with a great storyline,a fantastic and talented cast,plenty of hilarious scenes and some serious drama.The movie has made a terrific legacy for itself,a series of the same name was made two years later,and it ran for eleven years.I think the show is a lot better,its much funnier,more light hearted and much less violence.The cast of this movie is terrific,I think the best actor was Elliot Gould,because I found his character Trapper John McIntyre to be the funniest and stood out the most out of all of them,I also enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Tom Skerritt. A staff working in a field hospital during a Korean War use there humor and laughter to make them forget about the violence and horror of the war they are facing.

    When I first saw "Mash" back in 1970 or thereabouts I was certain that it was a masterpiece of filmmaking. Over the years, I've had occasion to see it several more times, and each time it's diminished a bit. It's obvious that the movie only masquerades as being about "Korea", this is about Viet Nam. In that light it's interesting that the humor seemed much easier to accept while the war in Viet Nam was still playing in our living rooms every night. It was irreverent and "in-your-face", but a viable counterpoint to the horror of what was actually going on in S.E. Asia. Since the war is - thankfully - long since over, the humor now seems simply mean-spirited and thoughtless.And Hawkeye and Trapper are simple smart-ass jerks. There's little noteworthy outside of the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper. Radar is pleasant enough, Hotlips and Frank Burns are just uncomfortable to watch. The rest is simply wallpaper. I guess my conclusion is that this was a movie for the moment. It doesn't hold up well now with 40 years of history under the bridge.

    No idea why this movie is considered to be a genre classic really. I don't know, perhaps I needed to be around at 1970 to fully understand its appeal and appreciate it, since it certainly was a popular movie at the time, that even had an even more successful TV-series following it up, only 2 years later. Thing that the movie is known and praised for, is its heavy anti-war message in it. Well, not a message really but it makes a statement by turning a war situation into something comical. Perhaps this was something that really spoke to people at the time because of America's involved with the Vietnam war. In that regard, this movie is perhaps being a bit too much a product of its time and has lost it relevance and impact. But that does not make a bad movie of course. What does make this movie quite bad is that it simply isn't very fun or funny to watch at all. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I chuckled just once. The rest of the movie mostly consists out of people talking over each other and behaving incredibly immature. This was another real problem I had with this movie; All of the characters behaved like a bunch of brats and really not one of them was being likable enough for me. This was perhaps the biggest reason why I just couldn't ever enjoy watching this movie. But really, another big problem of the movie for me was that it didn't even featured a main story in it. It made this movie come across as a real pointless one, that was never being good, interesting or funny enough. It just isn't going anywhere with any of it. Perhaps it was to show the whole pointlessness of war but this doesn't make the movie any more pleasant or good to follow. Maybe it would had also helped if the movie did actually showed some of its war but now I really never had the feeling as if the movie was taking place during a war situation. The cast-list sound interesting, with people such as Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall and Rene Auberjonois in it but most of them were still pretty big unknowns at the time and their roles also aren't all that big. The movie doesn't have one main character in it but it instead focuses on a whole bunch of them, for an equal amount of time. This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie. Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either. No way I will be ever seeing this one again! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    MASH is one of the greatest Comedies Of all time and a classic film that combines amazing direction,a fantastic ensemble cast,hilarious Black Comedy,wonderful script and a memorable film score making MASH one of Altman's best and a classic Comedy and War Film and not only one of the best films of the 1970s but one of the greatest films ever made. Based on the novel MASH:A Novel About Three Army Doctors and set during the Korean War in the early 1950s,MASH tells the story of a group of Army surgeons that includes Capt. Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),Trapper John McIntyre(Elliot Gould)and Duke Forrest(Tom Skerritt)that work inside a hospital and deal with Horrors of the War while getting into hilarious situations and misadventures. Before MASH was turned into the iconic and popular television series of the same name,MASH was an amazing,hilarious and edgy Black Comedy classic that was an Anti-War Satire and was also a cinema breakthrough for filmmaker Robert Altman and is a film that ranks with other great films and Black Comedies Dr Strangelove and Network and is one of the film that gave birth to the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s. One of the reasons MASH is a classic film is because Robert Altman takes the concept and subject of War and makes an Anti-War film that mocks the military and Wars in a funny and Satirical way that is bold and brave and at the same time creative and subversive in a original style. The Comedy and laughs in MASH is funny and hilarious and is done with in darkly Humorous way with scenes and dialog in the film that is smart and intelligent and can only exist in the bizarre and insane world of MASH that is truly wacky and offbeat and done with a weirdness and insane energy that never slows down or lets up until the very end and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I also love that The Comedy is politically incorrect and is the kind of Humor that you don't really see in films anymore and would offend viewers in today's world. What I also love about MASH is the episodic nature and structure of the film where there are scenes in the movie that jump from one to the next and some of the characters pop in and out of the narrative but the film is never disjointed or disconnected and I think the episodic style keeps the film moving at a great pace. While the film is set during the Korean War in the 1950s,MASH is more about the Vietnam War that was going on in the during the 1960s and 70s and Altman doesn't hold back in showing the danger and Horrors of going to War especially during the Hospital and surgery scenes which are done in a gritty and realistic way almost like a documentary of Surgery in Hospitals during a War. MASH is a Comedy and it is very funny but it's still an Anti-War film that is told from a cynical point of view that is harsh and unflinching. The three main characters in the film Hawkeye Pierce,Trapper John McIntyre and Duke Forrest are great and truly memorable characters because when you look at the characters you feel like that even though they are surgeons of War they don't really want to be in the War or military but rather in a bar drinking a small glass of martini,flirting with women or being at home and not participating in the War. The many scenes with Hawkeye and Trapper or the scenes the three main characters have together is funny and wonderful with the characters Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke saying memorable dialog that is very fresh,sarcastic and witty as well. Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke are three amazing characters you will never forget. The screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. is wonderful and well-written even much of the dialog was improvised by the cast and there's a lot of scenes of overlapping dialog between the main characters that is great and would become one of the many trademarks of Altman's films. The final 20-30 minutes and the film's ending is amazing and matches the rest of the film's manic comic energy. A great ending. The whole cast is wonderful. Donald Sutherland is excellent and hilarious as Captain Hawkeye Pierce,with Sutherland bringing laughs and coolness to the role. Elliot Gould is brilliant and funny as Captain Trapper John McIntyre and has great scenes with Sutherland. Tom Skerritt is amazing as Duke Forrest,Hawkeye and Trapper's friend. Sally Kellerman is fantastic as Major Hot Lips O'Houlihan,a straight laced nurse. Robert Duvall is wonderful as Major Frank Burns,an fellow Army Surgeon. Roger Bowen is terrific as Colonial Henry Blake,a man who's in charge of the MASH unit. Gary Burghoff is great as Corporal Radar,Blake right hand man. Burghoff also played the role on the television series. David Arkin is funny as Sgt. Major Vollmer,a by the book soldier. Jo Ann Plug is sensational and beautiful as Lt. Dish,Hawkeye's love interest. Fred Williamson is outstanding as Dr. Spearchucker Jones,a Football player who's now a surgeon. Michael Murphy is great as Me Lai Larston,a Surgeon in Japan. John Schuck is fantastic as Capt. Painless Waldowski,a dentist. G. Wood(General Hammond),Bud Cort(Private Boone)and Rene Auberjonois(Father John 'Dago Red' Mulcahy)give good performances as well. The direction by Robert Altman is brilliant,with Altman always moving the camera with zooms and close ups and giving the film a gritty and realistic look. Great direction by Altman. The score by Johnny Mandel is fantastic and memorable and brings a light and fun feeling to the film. I also love the classic theme song Suicide Is Painless that is used for the film(and later for the television series)and it truly matches the film's tone. In final word,if you love Robert Altman,Comedies,Black Comedies,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see MASH,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Laughter is good medicine. There are many many comedic tactics considered genius in their time that audiences no longer respond to now in any way. When you watch these older movies and television series you have to understand the context in which they were created and what their audience needed from that project at that time.

    Finally got around to watching (skimming through is more likely) the movie M*A*S*H. It was a popular TV show in the 70's and even my parents talked about watching the movie version when it was first released. But I was absolutely horrified and disgusted by its cynicism and callousness. There was no plot to the movie at all, and it wasn't funny. Donald Southerland is the farthest from being a funny actor, although he's not a big mouth like Alan Alda. Anybody wishing to be a medical doctor would be disillusioned by the seeming purposelessness of the surgeons working in a mobile army surgical hospital during the Korean War. Furthermore, the lyrics of the opening song shocked me: "suicide is painless. And I can take or leave it if I please." I would understand if these words came out of the mouths of desperate wounded soldiers, but they are not suitable for a drama about army surgeons. In addition, the movie pretends the characters were living in America; there is no mention about Korea even though it takes place in Korea during the terrible tragedies of the Korean War.

    I saw M*A*S*H with my mom when I was eight years old when it was first released in 1970. It was held over, when movie theaters would hold over films that made a lot of money. It was made for an estimated budget of 3.5 million dollars. It made 81 million in revenue, it was a big hit in those days. It was a milestone for Robert Altman, and put him on the map as a director. I was only eight but enjoyed the humor and the sexuality was more implied than graphic. Two years later when the series premiered on CBS, I readily tuned in to see how it compared to the film. It was a TV standards and practices marvel, in that CBS tried to get across the subversive point across as much as they could on a TV sitcom. Being a series of vignettes rather than a chronological film, it showed a new way to film movies. It was movie making genius then, and still holds up to scrutiny today.

    I only enjoyed the wits, dialogs & some dirty jokes by Sutherland. That's all. Other than the funny part, the screenplay is quite good, writing is fresh & the music (Suicide Is Painless) amazed me. MASH is an out-dated comedy weaker than Animal House. The plot or story isn't that great to follow. The characters take you for some jokes & comic thrills here and there. Those are the only points where you will enjoy this movie NOW in the YOLO generation. I don't know how it won the Golden Palm, but this is not my cup of war tea. For crying out loud, an average 5/10. BOTTOM LINE: This is not a classic as they (Wikipedia) say(s), but a sure one-time watch unless war comedies related to misogyny & lots of female nudity bore the hell out of you. Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

    M*A*S*H* is a terrific movie with a great storyline,a fantastic and talented cast,plenty of hilarious scenes and some serious drama.The movie has made a terrific legacy for itself,a series of the same name was made two years later,and it ran for eleven years.I think the show is a lot better,its much funnier,more light hearted and much less violence.The cast of this movie is terrific,I think the best actor was Elliot Gould,because I found his character Trapper John McIntyre to be the funniest and stood out the most out of all of them,I also enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Tom Skerritt. A staff working in a field hospital during a Korean War use there humor and laughter to make them forget about the violence and horror of the war they are facing.

    When I first saw "Mash" back in 1970 or thereabouts I was certain that it was a masterpiece of filmmaking. Over the years, I've had occasion to see it several more times, and each time it's diminished a bit. It's obvious that the movie only masquerades as being about "Korea", this is about Viet Nam. In that light it's interesting that the humor seemed much easier to accept while the war in Viet Nam was still playing in our living rooms every night. It was irreverent and "in-your-face", but a viable counterpoint to the horror of what was actually going on in S.E. Asia. Since the war is - thankfully - long since over, the humor now seems simply mean-spirited and thoughtless.And Hawkeye and Trapper are simple smart-ass jerks. There's little noteworthy outside of the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper. Radar is pleasant enough, Hotlips and Frank Burns are just uncomfortable to watch. The rest is simply wallpaper. I guess my conclusion is that this was a movie for the moment. It doesn't hold up well now with 40 years of history under the bridge.

    No idea why this movie is considered to be a genre classic really. I don't know, perhaps I needed to be around at 1970 to fully understand its appeal and appreciate it, since it certainly was a popular movie at the time, that even had an even more successful TV-series following it up, only 2 years later. Thing that the movie is known and praised for, is its heavy anti-war message in it. Well, not a message really but it makes a statement by turning a war situation into something comical. Perhaps this was something that really spoke to people at the time because of America's involved with the Vietnam war. In that regard, this movie is perhaps being a bit too much a product of its time and has lost it relevance and impact. But that does not make a bad movie of course. What does make this movie quite bad is that it simply isn't very fun or funny to watch at all. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I chuckled just once. The rest of the movie mostly consists out of people talking over each other and behaving incredibly immature. This was another real problem I had with this movie; All of the characters behaved like a bunch of brats and really not one of them was being likable enough for me. This was perhaps the biggest reason why I just couldn't ever enjoy watching this movie. But really, another big problem of the movie for me was that it didn't even featured a main story in it. It made this movie come across as a real pointless one, that was never being good, interesting or funny enough. It just isn't going anywhere with any of it. Perhaps it was to show the whole pointlessness of war but this doesn't make the movie any more pleasant or good to follow. Maybe it would had also helped if the movie did actually showed some of its war but now I really never had the feeling as if the movie was taking place during a war situation. The cast-list sound interesting, with people such as Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall and Rene Auberjonois in it but most of them were still pretty big unknowns at the time and their roles also aren't all that big. The movie doesn't have one main character in it but it instead focuses on a whole bunch of them, for an equal amount of time. This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie. Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either. No way I will be ever seeing this one again! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One Of The Greatest Films And Comedies Of Ever Made. An Excellent And Hilarious Classic Black Comedy War Film. Robert Altman At His Best.

    MASH is one of the greatest Comedies Of all time and a classic film that combines amazing direction,a fantastic ensemble cast,hilarious Black Comedy,wonderful script and a memorable film score making MASH one of Altman's best and a classic Comedy and War Film and not only one of the best films of the 1970s but one of the greatest films ever made. Based on the novel MASH:A Novel About Three Army Doctors and set during the Korean War in the early 1950s,MASH tells the story of a group of Army surgeons that includes Capt. Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),Trapper John McIntyre(Elliot Gould)and Duke Forrest(Tom Skerritt)that work inside a hospital and deal with Horrors of the War while getting into hilarious situations and misadventures. Before MASH was turned into the iconic and popular television series of the same name,MASH was an amazing,hilarious and edgy Black Comedy classic that was an Anti-War Satire and was also a cinema breakthrough for filmmaker Robert Altman and is a film that ranks with other great films and Black Comedies Dr Strangelove and Network and is one of the film that gave birth to the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s. One of the reasons MASH is a classic film is because Robert Altman takes the concept and subject of War and makes an Anti-War film that mocks the military and Wars in a funny and Satirical way that is bold and brave and at the same time creative and subversive in a original style. The Comedy and laughs in MASH is funny and hilarious and is done with in darkly Humorous way with scenes and dialog in the film that is smart and intelligent and can only exist in the bizarre and insane world of MASH that is truly wacky and offbeat and done with a weirdness and insane energy that never slows down or lets up until the very end and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I also love that The Comedy is politically incorrect and is the kind of Humor that you don't really see in films anymore and would offend viewers in today's world. What I also love about MASH is the episodic nature and structure of the film where there are scenes in the movie that jump from one to the next and some of the characters pop in and out of the narrative but the film is never disjointed or disconnected and I think the episodic style keeps the film moving at a great pace. While the film is set during the Korean War in the 1950s,MASH is more about the Vietnam War that was going on in the during the 1960s and 70s and Altman doesn't hold back in showing the danger and Horrors of going to War especially during the Hospital and surgery scenes which are done in a gritty and realistic way almost like a documentary of Surgery in Hospitals during a War. MASH is a Comedy and it is very funny but it's still an Anti-War film that is told from a cynical point of view that is harsh and unflinching. The three main characters in the film Hawkeye Pierce,Trapper John McIntyre and Duke Forrest are great and truly memorable characters because when you look at the characters you feel like that even though they are surgeons of War they don't really want to be in the War or military but rather in a bar drinking a small glass of martini,flirting with women or being at home and not participating in the War. The many scenes with Hawkeye and Trapper or the scenes the three main characters have together is funny and wonderful with the characters Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke saying memorable dialog that is very fresh,sarcastic and witty as well. Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke are three amazing characters you will never forget. The screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. is wonderful and well-written even much of the dialog was improvised by the cast and there's a lot of scenes of overlapping dialog between the main characters that is great and would become one of the many trademarks of Altman's films. The final 20-30 minutes and the film's ending is amazing and matches the rest of the film's manic comic energy. A great ending. The whole cast is wonderful. Donald Sutherland is excellent and hilarious as Captain Hawkeye Pierce,with Sutherland bringing laughs and coolness to the role. Elliot Gould is brilliant and funny as Captain Trapper John McIntyre and has great scenes with Sutherland. Tom Skerritt is amazing as Duke Forrest,Hawkeye and Trapper's friend. Sally Kellerman is fantastic as Major Hot Lips O'Houlihan,a straight laced nurse. Robert Duvall is wonderful as Major Frank Burns,an fellow Army Surgeon. Roger Bowen is terrific as Colonial Henry Blake,a man who's in charge of the MASH unit. Gary Burghoff is great as Corporal Radar,Blake right hand man. Burghoff also played the role on the television series. David Arkin is funny as Sgt. Major Vollmer,a by the book soldier. Jo Ann Plug is sensational and beautiful as Lt. Dish,Hawkeye's love interest. Fred Williamson is outstanding as Dr. Spearchucker Jones,a Football player who's now a surgeon. Michael Murphy is great as Me Lai Larston,a Surgeon in Japan. John Schuck is fantastic as Capt. Painless Waldowski,a dentist. G. Wood(General Hammond),Bud Cort(Private Boone)and Rene Auberjonois(Father John 'Dago Red' Mulcahy)give good performances as well. The direction by Robert Altman is brilliant,with Altman always moving the camera with zooms and close ups and giving the film a gritty and realistic look. Great direction by Altman. The score by Johnny Mandel is fantastic and memorable and brings a light and fun feeling to the film. I also love the classic theme song Suicide Is Painless that is used for the film(and later for the television series)and it truly matches the film's tone. In final word,if you love Robert Altman,Comedies,Black Comedies,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see MASH,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    To me, Altman's second-best film, behind "Nashville," which is so uniquely brilliant, it defies classification! Regardless of it being set during the Korean War, this is obviously a commentary on the insanity of the current-at-that-time Vietnam War, and of war in general. The surgeons are endlessly patching up the badly wounded, and they keep coming. The endless cycle leads to the surgeons and other personnel just trying to keep sane. There is quite of mix of gore and laughs as the characters make their way through the conflict. And, surreal moments that transcend it all. Altman was a master at breaking the rules, and has a dream cast that makes the film perfect. I saw this at the 75th Anniversary for 20th Century Fox at Lincoln Center in 2010. I got to meet and have a real conversation with Elliott Gould, easily the best interaction with a celebrity I have ever had. There was a showing of a new 35mm print of the film, and a post discussion with Elliott, Tom Skerritt, and the wife of Mr. Altman. I even have a signed poster! Excellent film, easily watchable again and again. And, the P.A. announcements are so very funny! ********** (10 Out of 10 Stars)

    The film MASH opens with the arrival of Captain Pierce and Duke Forrest in an army field hospital as sergeants during the Korean War and ends with their departure. And in between we have the life of men and women in the camp. There are little pieces of stories and incidents we get to know about, some of them are funny, some disgusting and some empty. It's very difficult to talk about the film, not because it's obscure but because it is vastly pointless. It becomes quite clear that Robert Altman tried his best to make a film out of these little pieces, and that is probably the biggest drawback of the film - his effort shows. I won't blame Jean Luc Godard for not being able to tell a story the way it should be told, because his intentions were never to do so. He can be criticized for what he tried not for what he didn't. But unfortunately, Altman's success or failure in MASH should be judged in terms of these stories through which he tries to get inside this Army field hospital and of course the way he puts it. Looking back at a film like MASH made around 40 years ago, it is quite difficult to figure out the reasons behind its popularity, and hey, it's far from experimental too. The question is what is the film then? What is it about? Well, it's kind of a comedy which doesn't make you laugh that much. It's kind of an anti-war film that doesn't have much to say against war. It's kind of a psychological endeavor that doesn't penetrate. The film, MASH, is careless and indiscipline one, very much like the characters it depicts. MASH is probably a satirical, bit circus tic, black and bleak comedy  mostly ineffective. I think MASH is a war film that, fortunately, has nothing to do with heroism, bravery, patriotism or honor  instead it's about sadism, cruelty, cowardice and utter stupidity. I feel sad at the end of the film precisely because of its inability to take this influential project further. It fails to build up the characters it portrays. We are never at home with them; we don't know how to react. These characters never grow; they provide us no reason to follow them. Think about the football match sequence, all of a sudden we have a football match coming up from nowhere, and that too an elaborated coverage, the whole thing was absolutely rubbish and the film could have been better without it. Think about the suicide drama, think about the Korean boy they all seem stories out of place - we don't know them; we aren't linked. There are certain things that I find very disgusting too, for example, the way the film portrays the female character, hot lips. She arrives in the camp with a mission; she finds the whole atmosphere in the camp very messy and unorganized. She talks about discipline and order, and throughout the rest of the film she is mocked by everyone. She almost becomes a ridiculous and stupid creature, readily available for everything. She only finds Frank, but even Frank is forced to leave the field hospital by Captain Pierce and others. Hot lips' privacy is badly hampered twice, once when she is having sex with Frank, someone puts the microphone inside the room, and the whole hospital gets to hear the sounds. Secondly, all the temporary curtains were taken off while she is taking a bath, and she is exposed fully in front of everybody seated outside, with even musical instruments, a gallant show of laughter and disdain, and a worst possible part of the film for me. She is further ridiculed when she goes to the room of the officer in charge or whatever to complain about all these, we see her absolutely unable to make her point being angry and ends up shouting and crying, saying nothing. She is ridiculous, vague, overtly emotional and probably stretched as far as someone crazy. I don't know what Robert Altman wanted to achieve by all these, cruelty, disrespect, irresponsibility, perversion, voyeurism of these people in the military field hospital? May be, but since his whole project is a failure, at the end, it seems a perversion on the part of the director and nothing else. Hey, MASH won one of the most prestigious film awards of all, the P'lm Dore at the Cannes film festival in 1970, something it doesn't deserve, really.

    There was so much pain after that war. Most of you commenting weren't even born yet and you don't know the turmoil the media constantly thrust at the American public trying to get ratings and using the networks for political agendas mostly condemning the war. America was more naive and gullible and not as jaded as they are now. In a very tangible way every week and right in front of them on their TV screens was a way to draw the whole country back together in MASH. Whether you were for or against the war it made the soldiers who fought in the war more real and more human. They had faults.. some of them were terrible faults and some of them had wonderful strengths but America had suffered enough and it was time to laugh and get on with life. It wasn't a show that could work before that time or after that time but during that time MASH because a way for people to feel more normal about surviving that part of American history. Laughter is good medicine. There are many many comedic tactics considered genius in their time that audiences no longer respond to now in any way. When you watch these older movies and television series you have to understand the context in which they were created and what their audience needed from that project at that time.

This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie. Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either. No way I will be ever seeing this one again! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    MASH is one of the greatest Comedies Of all time and a classic film that combines amazing direction,a fantastic ensemble cast,hilarious Black Comedy,wonderful script and a memorable film score making MASH one of Altman's best and a classic Comedy and War Film and not only one of the best films of the 1970s but one of the greatest films ever made. Based on the novel MASH:A Novel About Three Army Doctors and set during the Korean War in the early 1950s,MASH tells the story of a group of Army surgeons that includes Capt. Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),Trapper John McIntyre(Elliot Gould)and Duke Forrest(Tom Skerritt)that work inside a hospital and deal with Horrors of the War while getting into hilarious situations and misadventures. Before MASH was turned into the iconic and popular television series of the same name,MASH was an amazing,hilarious and edgy Black Comedy classic that was an Anti-War Satire and was also a cinema breakthrough for filmmaker Robert Altman and is a film that ranks with other great films and Black Comedies Dr Strangelove and Network and is one of the film that gave birth to the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s. One of the reasons MASH is a classic film is because Robert Altman takes the concept and subject of War and makes an Anti-War film that mocks the military and Wars in a funny and Satirical way that is bold and brave and at the same time creative and subversive in a original style. The Comedy and laughs in MASH is funny and hilarious and is done with in darkly Humorous way with scenes and dialog in the film that is smart and intelligent and can only exist in the bizarre and insane world of MASH that is truly wacky and offbeat and done with a weirdness and insane energy that never slows down or lets up until the very end and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I also love that The Comedy is politically incorrect and is the kind of Humor that you don't really see in films anymore and would offend viewers in today's world. What I also love about MASH is the episodic nature and structure of the film where there are scenes in the movie that jump from one to the next and some of the characters pop in and out of the narrative but the film is never disjointed or disconnected and I think the episodic style keeps the film moving at a great pace. While the film is set during the Korean War in the 1950s,MASH is more about the Vietnam War that was going on in the during the 1960s and 70s and Altman doesn't hold back in showing the danger and Horrors of going to War especially during the Hospital and surgery scenes which are done in a gritty and realistic way almost like a documentary of Surgery in Hospitals during a War. MASH is a Comedy and it is very funny but it's still an Anti-War film that is told from a cynical point of view that is harsh and unflinching. The three main characters in the film Hawkeye Pierce,Trapper John McIntyre and Duke Forrest are great and truly memorable characters because when you look at the characters you feel like that even though they are surgeons of War they don't really want to be in the War or military but rather in a bar drinking a small glass of martini,flirting with women or being at home and not participating in the War. The many scenes with Hawkeye and Trapper or the scenes the three main characters have together is funny and wonderful with the characters Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke saying memorable dialog that is very fresh,sarcastic and witty as well. Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke are three amazing characters you will never forget. The screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. is wonderful and well-written even much of the dialog was improvised by the cast and there's a lot of scenes of overlapping dialog between the main characters that is great and would become one of the many trademarks of Altman's films. The final 20-30 minutes and the film's ending is amazing and matches the rest of the film's manic comic energy. A great ending. The whole cast is wonderful. Donald Sutherland is excellent and hilarious as Captain Hawkeye Pierce,with Sutherland bringing laughs and coolness to the role. Elliot Gould is brilliant and funny as Captain Trapper John McIntyre and has great scenes with Sutherland. Tom Skerritt is amazing as Duke Forrest,Hawkeye and Trapper's friend. Sally Kellerman is fantastic as Major Hot Lips O'Houlihan,a straight laced nurse. Robert Duvall is wonderful as Major Frank Burns,an fellow Army Surgeon. Roger Bowen is terrific as Colonial Henry Blake,a man who's in charge of the MASH unit. Gary Burghoff is great as Corporal Radar,Blake right hand man. Burghoff also played the role on the television series. David Arkin is funny as Sgt. Major Vollmer,a by the book soldier. Jo Ann Plug is sensational and beautiful as Lt. Dish,Hawkeye's love interest. Fred Williamson is outstanding as Dr. Spearchucker Jones,a Football player who's now a surgeon. Michael Murphy is great as Me Lai Larston,a Surgeon in Japan. John Schuck is fantastic as Capt. Painless Waldowski,a dentist. G. Wood(General Hammond),Bud Cort(Private Boone)and Rene Auberjonois(Father John 'Dago Red' Mulcahy)give good performances as well. The direction by Robert Altman is brilliant,with Altman always moving the camera with zooms and close ups and giving the film a gritty and realistic look. Great direction by Altman. The score by Johnny Mandel is fantastic and memorable and brings a light and fun feeling to the film. I also love the classic theme song Suicide Is Painless that is used for the film(and later for the television series)and it truly matches the film's tone. In final word,if you love Robert Altman,Comedies,Black Comedies,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see MASH,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    To me, Altman's second-best film, behind "Nashville," which is so uniquely brilliant, it defies classification! Regardless of it being set during the Korean War, this is obviously a commentary on the insanity of the current-at-that-time Vietnam War, and of war in general. The surgeons are endlessly patching up the badly wounded, and they keep coming. The endless cycle leads to the surgeons and other personnel just trying to keep sane. There is quite of mix of gore and laughs as the characters make their way through the conflict. And, surreal moments that transcend it all. Altman was a master at breaking the rules, and has a dream cast that makes the film perfect. I saw this at the 75th Anniversary for 20th Century Fox at Lincoln Center in 2010. I got to meet and have a real conversation with Elliott Gould, easily the best interaction with a celebrity I have ever had. There was a showing of a new 35mm print of the film, and a post discussion with Elliott, Tom Skerritt, and the wife of Mr. Altman. I even have a signed poster! Excellent film, easily watchable again and again. And, the P.A. announcements are so very funny! ********** (10 Out of 10 Stars)

    The film MASH opens with the arrival of Captain Pierce and Duke Forrest in an army field hospital as sergeants during the Korean War and ends with their departure. And in between we have the life of men and women in the camp. There are little pieces of stories and incidents we get to know about, some of them are funny, some disgusting and some empty. It's very difficult to talk about the film, not because it's obscure but because it is vastly pointless. It becomes quite clear that Robert Altman tried his best to make a film out of these little pieces, and that is probably the biggest drawback of the film - his effort shows. I won't blame Jean Luc Godard for not being able to tell a story the way it should be told, because his intentions were never to do so. He can be criticized for what he tried not for what he didn't. But unfortunately, Altman's success or failure in MASH should be judged in terms of these stories through which he tries to get inside this Army field hospital and of course the way he puts it. Looking back at a film like MASH made around 40 years ago, it is quite difficult to figure out the reasons behind its popularity, and hey, it's far from experimental too. The question is what is the film then? What is it about? Well, it's kind of a comedy which doesn't make you laugh that much. It's kind of an anti-war film that doesn't have much to say against war. It's kind of a psychological endeavor that doesn't penetrate. The film, MASH, is careless and indiscipline one, very much like the characters it depicts. MASH is probably a satirical, bit circus tic, black and bleak comedy  mostly ineffective. I think MASH is a war film that, fortunately, has nothing to do with heroism, bravery, patriotism or honor  instead it's about sadism, cruelty, cowardice and utter stupidity. I feel sad at the end of the film precisely because of its inability to take this influential project further. It fails to build up the characters it portrays. We are never at home with them; we don't know how to react. These characters never grow; they provide us no reason to follow them. Think about the football match sequence, all of a sudden we have a football match coming up from nowhere, and that too an elaborated coverage, the whole thing was absolutely rubbish and the film could have been better without it. Think about the suicide drama, think about the Korean boy they all seem stories out of place - we don't know them; we aren't linked. There are certain things that I find very disgusting too, for example, the way the film portrays the female character, hot lips. She arrives in the camp with a mission; she finds the whole atmosphere in the camp very messy and unorganized. She talks about discipline and order, and throughout the rest of the film she is mocked by everyone. She almost becomes a ridiculous and stupid creature, readily available for everything. She only finds Frank, but even Frank is forced to leave the field hospital by Captain Pierce and others. Hot lips' privacy is badly hampered twice, once when she is having sex with Frank, someone puts the microphone inside the room, and the whole hospital gets to hear the sounds. Secondly, all the temporary curtains were taken off while she is taking a bath, and she is exposed fully in front of everybody seated outside, with even musical instruments, a gallant show of laughter and disdain, and a worst possible part of the film for me. She is further ridiculed when she goes to the room of the officer in charge or whatever to complain about all these, we see her absolutely unable to make her point being angry and ends up shouting and crying, saying nothing. She is ridiculous, vague, overtly emotional and probably stretched as far as someone crazy. I don't know what Robert Altman wanted to achieve by all these, cruelty, disrespect, irresponsibility, perversion, voyeurism of these people in the military field hospital? May be, but since his whole project is a failure, at the end, it seems a perversion on the part of the director and nothing else. Hey, MASH won one of the most prestigious film awards of all, the P'lm Dore at the Cannes film festival in 1970, something it doesn't deserve, really.

    There was so much pain after that war. Most of you commenting weren't even born yet and you don't know the turmoil the media constantly thrust at the American public trying to get ratings and using the networks for political agendas mostly condemning the war. America was more naive and gullible and not as jaded as they are now. In a very tangible way every week and right in front of them on their TV screens was a way to draw the whole country back together in MASH. Whether you were for or against the war it made the soldiers who fought in the war more real and more human. They had faults.. some of them were terrible faults and some of them had wonderful strengths but America had suffered enough and it was time to laugh and get on with life. It wasn't a show that could work before that time or after that time but during that time MASH because a way for people to feel more normal about surviving that part of American history. Laughter is good medicine. There are many many comedic tactics considered genius in their time that audiences no longer respond to now in any way. When you watch these older movies and television series you have to understand the context in which they were created and what their audience needed from that project at that time.

    Finally got around to watching (skimming through is more likely) the movie M*A*S*H. It was a popular TV show in the 70's and even my parents talked about watching the movie version when it was first released. But I was absolutely horrified and disgusted by its cynicism and callousness. There was no plot to the movie at all, and it wasn't funny. Donald Southerland is the farthest from being a funny actor, although he's not a big mouth like Alan Alda. Anybody wishing to be a medical doctor would be disillusioned by the seeming purposelessness of the surgeons working in a mobile army surgical hospital during the Korean War. Furthermore, the lyrics of the opening song shocked me: "suicide is painless. And I can take or leave it if I please." I would understand if these words came out of the mouths of desperate wounded soldiers, but they are not suitable for a drama about army surgeons. In addition, the movie pretends the characters were living in America; there is no mention about Korea even though it takes place in Korea during the terrible tragedies of the Korean War.

    I saw M*A*S*H with my mom when I was eight years old when it was first released in 1970. It was held over, when movie theaters would hold over films that made a lot of money. It was made for an estimated budget of 3.5 million dollars. It made 81 million in revenue, it was a big hit in those days. It was a milestone for Robert Altman, and put him on the map as a director. I was only eight but enjoyed the humor and the sexuality was more implied than graphic. Two years later when the series premiered on CBS, I readily tuned in to see how it compared to the film. It was a TV standards and practices marvel, in that CBS tried to get across the subversive point across as much as they could on a TV sitcom. Being a series of vignettes rather than a chronological film, it showed a new way to film movies. It was movie making genius then, and still holds up to scrutiny today.

    I only enjoyed the wits, dialogs & some dirty jokes by Sutherland. That's all. Other than the funny part, the screenplay is quite good, writing is fresh & the music (Suicide Is Painless) amazed me. MASH is an out-dated comedy weaker than Animal House. The plot or story isn't that great to follow. The characters take you for some jokes & comic thrills here and there. Those are the only points where you will enjoy this movie NOW in the YOLO generation. I don't know how it won the Golden Palm, but this is not my cup of war tea. For crying out loud, an average 5/10. BOTTOM LINE: This is not a classic as they (Wikipedia) say(s), but a sure one-time watch unless war comedies related to misogyny & lots of female nudity bore the hell out of you. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO Language: No | Sex: Strong | Nudity: Very Strong | Mouth-Kiss, Foreplay: Strong | Violence: Mild | Gore: Infinity | Smoking: No | Alcohol, Drugs: Strong

    M*A*S*H* is a terrific movie with a great storyline,a fantastic and talented cast,plenty of hilarious scenes and some serious drama.The movie has made a terrific legacy for itself,a series of the same name was made two years later,and it ran for eleven years.I think the show is a lot better,its much funnier,more light hearted and much less violence.The cast of this movie is terrific,I think the best actor was Elliot Gould,because I found his character Trapper John McIntyre to be the funniest and stood out the most out of all of them,I also enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Tom Skerritt. A staff working in a field hospital during a Korean War use there humor and laughter to make them forget about the violence and horror of the war they are facing.

    When I first saw "Mash" back in 1970 or thereabouts I was certain that it was a masterpiece of filmmaking. Over the years, I've had occasion to see it several more times, and each time it's diminished a bit. It's obvious that the movie only masquerades as being about "Korea", this is about Viet Nam. In that light it's interesting that the humor seemed much easier to accept while the war in Viet Nam was still playing in our living rooms every night. It was irreverent and "in-your-face", but a viable counterpoint to the horror of what was actually going on in S.E. Asia. Since the war is - thankfully - long since over, the humor now seems simply mean-spirited and thoughtless.And Hawkeye and Trapper are simple smart-ass jerks. There's little noteworthy outside of the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper. Radar is pleasant enough, Hotlips and Frank Burns are just uncomfortable to watch. The rest is simply wallpaper. I guess my conclusion is that this was a movie for the moment. It doesn't hold up well now with 40 years of history under the bridge.

    No idea why this movie is considered to be a genre classic really. I don't know, perhaps I needed to be around at 1970 to fully understand its appeal and appreciate it, since it certainly was a popular movie at the time, that even had an even more successful TV-series following it up, only 2 years later. Thing that the movie is known and praised for, is its heavy anti-war message in it. Well, not a message really but it makes a statement by turning a war situation into something comical. Perhaps this was something that really spoke to people at the time because of America's involved with the Vietnam war. In that regard, this movie is perhaps being a bit too much a product of its time and has lost it relevance and impact. But that does not make a bad movie of course. What does make this movie quite bad is that it simply isn't very fun or funny to watch at all. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I chuckled just once. The rest of the movie mostly consists out of people talking over each other and behaving incredibly immature. This was another real problem I had with this movie; All of the characters behaved like a bunch of brats and really not one of them was being likable enough for me. This was perhaps the biggest reason why I just couldn't ever enjoy watching this movie. But really, another big problem of the movie for me was that it didn't even featured a main story in it. It made this movie come across as a real pointless one, that was never being good, interesting or funny enough. It just isn't going anywhere with any of it. Perhaps it was to show the whole pointlessness of war but this doesn't make the movie any more pleasant or good to follow. Maybe it would had also helped if the movie did actually showed some of its war but now I really never had the feeling as if the movie was taking place during a war situation. The cast-list sound interesting, with people such as Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall and Rene Auberjonois in it but most of them were still pretty big unknowns at the time and their roles also aren't all that big. The movie doesn't have one main character in it but it instead focuses on a whole bunch of them, for an equal amount of time. This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie. Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either. No way I will be ever seeing this one again! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

MASH is probably a satirical, bit circus tic, black and bleak comedy  mostly ineffective. I think MASH is a war film that, fortunately, has nothing to do with heroism, bravery, patriotism or honor  instead it's about sadism, cruelty, cowardice and utter stupidity. I feel sad at the end of the film precisely because of its inability to take this influential project further. It fails to build up the characters it portrays. We are never at home with them; we don't know how to react. These characters never grow; they provide us no reason to follow them. Think about the football match sequence, all of a sudden we have a football match coming up from nowhere, and that too an elaborated coverage, the whole thing was absolutely rubbish and the film could have been better without it. Think about the suicide drama, think about the Korean boy they all seem stories out of place - we don't know them; we aren't linked. There are certain things that I find very disgusting too, for example, the way the film portrays the female character, hot lips. She arrives in the camp with a mission; she finds the whole atmosphere in the camp very messy and unorganized. She talks about discipline and order, and throughout the rest of the film she is mocked by everyone. She almost becomes a ridiculous and stupid creature, readily available for everything. She only finds Frank, but even Frank is forced to leave the field hospital by Captain Pierce and others. Hot lips' privacy is badly hampered twice, once when she is having sex with Frank, someone puts the microphone inside the room, and the whole hospital gets to hear the sounds. Secondly, all the temporary curtains were taken off while she is taking a bath, and she is exposed fully in front of everybody seated outside, with even musical instruments, a gallant show of laughter and disdain, and a worst possible part of the film for me. She is further ridiculed when she goes to the room of the officer in charge or whatever to complain about all these, we see her absolutely unable to make her point being angry and ends up shouting and crying, saying nothing. She is ridiculous, vague, overtly emotional and probably stretched as far as someone crazy. I don't know what Robert Altman wanted to achieve by all these, cruelty, disrespect, irresponsibility, perversion, voyeurism of these people in the military field hospital? May be, but since his whole project is a failure, at the end, it seems a perversion on the part of the director and nothing else. Hey, MASH won one of the most prestigious film awards of all, the P'lm Dore at the Cannes film festival in 1970, something it doesn't deserve, really.

    There was so much pain after that war. Most of you commenting weren't even born yet and you don't know the turmoil the media constantly thrust at the American public trying to get ratings and using the networks for political agendas mostly condemning the war. America was more naive and gullible and not as jaded as they are now. In a very tangible way every week and right in front of them on their TV screens was a way to draw the whole country back together in MASH. Whether you were for or against the war it made the soldiers who fought in the war more real and more human. They had faults.. some of them were terrible faults and some of them had wonderful strengths but America had suffered enough and it was time to laugh and get on with life. It wasn't a show that could work before that time or after that time but during that time MASH because a way for people to feel more normal about surviving that part of American history. Laughter is good medicine. There are many many comedic tactics considered genius in their time that audiences no longer respond to now in any way. When you watch these older movies and television series you have to understand the context in which they were created and what their audience needed from that project at that time.

    Finally got around to watching (skimming through is more likely) the movie M*A*S*H. It was a popular TV show in the 70's and even my parents talked about watching the movie version when it was first released. But I was absolutely horrified and disgusted by its cynicism and callousness. There was no plot to the movie at all, and it wasn't funny. Donald Southerland is the farthest from being a funny actor, although he's not a big mouth like Alan Alda. Anybody wishing to be a medical doctor would be disillusioned by the seeming purposelessness of the surgeons working in a mobile army surgical hospital during the Korean War. Furthermore, the lyrics of the opening song shocked me: "suicide is painless. And I can take or leave it if I please." I would understand if these words came out of the mouths of desperate wounded soldiers, but they are not suitable for a drama about army surgeons. In addition, the movie pretends the characters were living in America; there is no mention about Korea even though it takes place in Korea during the terrible tragedies of the Korean War.

    I saw M*A*S*H with my mom when I was eight years old when it was first released in 1970. It was held over, when movie theaters would hold over films that made a lot of money. It was made for an estimated budget of 3.5 million dollars. It made 81 million in revenue, it was a big hit in those days. It was a milestone for Robert Altman, and put him on the map as a director. I was only eight but enjoyed the humor and the sexuality was more implied than graphic. Two years later when the series premiered on CBS, I readily tuned in to see how it compared to the film. It was a TV standards and practices marvel, in that CBS tried to get across the subversive point across as much as they could on a TV sitcom. Being a series of vignettes rather than a chronological film, it showed a new way to film movies. It was movie making genius then, and still holds up to scrutiny today.

    I only enjoyed the wits, dialogs & some dirty jokes by Sutherland. That's all. Other than the funny part, the screenplay is quite good, writing is fresh & the music (Suicide Is Painless) amazed me. MASH is an out-dated comedy weaker than Animal House. The plot or story isn't that great to follow. The characters take you for some jokes & comic thrills here and there. Those are the only points where you will enjoy this movie NOW in the YOLO generation. I don't know how it won the Golden Palm, but this is not my cup of war tea. For crying out loud, an average 5/10. BOTTOM LINE: This is not a classic as they (Wikipedia) say(s), but a sure one-time watch unless war comedies related to misogyny & lots of female nudity bore the hell out of you. Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

A staff working in a field hospital during a Korean War use there humor and laughter to make them forget about the violence and horror of the war they are facing.

    When I first saw "Mash" back in 1970 or thereabouts I was certain that it was a masterpiece of filmmaking. Over the years, I've had occasion to see it several more times, and each time it's diminished a bit. It's obvious that the movie only masquerades as being about "Korea", this is about Viet Nam. In that light it's interesting that the humor seemed much easier to accept while the war in Viet Nam was still playing in our living rooms every night. It was irreverent and "in-your-face", but a viable counterpoint to the horror of what was actually going on in S.E. Asia. Since the war is - thankfully - long since over, the humor now seems simply mean-spirited and thoughtless.And Hawkeye and Trapper are simple smart-ass jerks. There's little noteworthy outside of the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper. Radar is pleasant enough, Hotlips and Frank Burns are just uncomfortable to watch. The rest is simply wallpaper. I guess my conclusion is that this was a movie for the moment. It doesn't hold up well now with 40 years of history under the bridge.

    No idea why this movie is considered to be a genre classic really. I don't know, perhaps I needed to be around at 1970 to fully understand its appeal and appreciate it, since it certainly was a popular movie at the time, that even had an even more successful TV-series following it up, only 2 years later. Thing that the movie is known and praised for, is its heavy anti-war message in it. Well, not a message really but it makes a statement by turning a war situation into something comical. Perhaps this was something that really spoke to people at the time because of America's involved with the Vietnam war. In that regard, this movie is perhaps being a bit too much a product of its time and has lost it relevance and impact. But that does not make a bad movie of course. What does make this movie quite bad is that it simply isn't very fun or funny to watch at all. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I chuckled just once. The rest of the movie mostly consists out of people talking over each other and behaving incredibly immature. This was another real problem I had with this movie; All of the characters behaved like a bunch of brats and really not one of them was being likable enough for me. This was perhaps the biggest reason why I just couldn't ever enjoy watching this movie. But really, another big problem of the movie for me was that it didn't even featured a main story in it. It made this movie come across as a real pointless one, that was never being good, interesting or funny enough. It just isn't going anywhere with any of it. Perhaps it was to show the whole pointlessness of war but this doesn't make the movie any more pleasant or good to follow. Maybe it would had also helped if the movie did actually showed some of its war but now I really never had the feeling as if the movie was taking place during a war situation. The cast-list sound interesting, with people such as Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall and Rene Auberjonois in it but most of them were still pretty big unknowns at the time and their roles also aren't all that big. The movie doesn't have one main character in it but it instead focuses on a whole bunch of them, for an equal amount of time. This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie. Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either. No way I will be ever seeing this one again! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One Of The Greatest Films And Comedies Of Ever Made. An Excellent And Hilarious Classic Black Comedy War Film. Robert Altman At His Best.

    MASH is one of the greatest Comedies Of all time and a classic film that combines amazing direction,a fantastic ensemble cast,hilarious Black Comedy,wonderful script and a memorable film score making MASH one of Altman's best and a classic Comedy and War Film and not only one of the best films of the 1970s but one of the greatest films ever made. Based on the novel MASH:A Novel About Three Army Doctors and set during the Korean War in the early 1950s,MASH tells the story of a group of Army surgeons that includes Capt. Hawkeye Pierce(Donald Sutherland),Trapper John McIntyre(Elliot Gould)and Duke Forrest(Tom Skerritt)that work inside a hospital and deal with Horrors of the War while getting into hilarious situations and misadventures. Before MASH was turned into the iconic and popular television series of the same name,MASH was an amazing,hilarious and edgy Black Comedy classic that was an Anti-War Satire and was also a cinema breakthrough for filmmaker Robert Altman and is a film that ranks with other great films and Black Comedies Dr Strangelove and Network and is one of the film that gave birth to the New Hollywood movement of the 1970s. One of the reasons MASH is a classic film is because Robert Altman takes the concept and subject of War and makes an Anti-War film that mocks the military and Wars in a funny and Satirical way that is bold and brave and at the same time creative and subversive in a original style. The Comedy and laughs in MASH is funny and hilarious and is done with in darkly Humorous way with scenes and dialog in the film that is smart and intelligent and can only exist in the bizarre and insane world of MASH that is truly wacky and offbeat and done with a weirdness and insane energy that never slows down or lets up until the very end and you as the viewer are along for the ride. I also love that The Comedy is politically incorrect and is the kind of Humor that you don't really see in films anymore and would offend viewers in today's world. What I also love about MASH is the episodic nature and structure of the film where there are scenes in the movie that jump from one to the next and some of the characters pop in and out of the narrative but the film is never disjointed or disconnected and I think the episodic style keeps the film moving at a great pace. While the film is set during the Korean War in the 1950s,MASH is more about the Vietnam War that was going on in the during the 1960s and 70s and Altman doesn't hold back in showing the danger and Horrors of going to War especially during the Hospital and surgery scenes which are done in a gritty and realistic way almost like a documentary of Surgery in Hospitals during a War. MASH is a Comedy and it is very funny but it's still an Anti-War film that is told from a cynical point of view that is harsh and unflinching. The three main characters in the film Hawkeye Pierce,Trapper John McIntyre and Duke Forrest are great and truly memorable characters because when you look at the characters you feel like that even though they are surgeons of War they don't really want to be in the War or military but rather in a bar drinking a small glass of martini,flirting with women or being at home and not participating in the War. The many scenes with Hawkeye and Trapper or the scenes the three main characters have together is funny and wonderful with the characters Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke saying memorable dialog that is very fresh,sarcastic and witty as well. Hawkeye,Trapper and Duke are three amazing characters you will never forget. The screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr. is wonderful and well-written even much of the dialog was improvised by the cast and there's a lot of scenes of overlapping dialog between the main characters that is great and would become one of the many trademarks of Altman's films. The final 20-30 minutes and the film's ending is amazing and matches the rest of the film's manic comic energy. A great ending. The whole cast is wonderful. Donald Sutherland is excellent and hilarious as Captain Hawkeye Pierce,with Sutherland bringing laughs and coolness to the role. Elliot Gould is brilliant and funny as Captain Trapper John McIntyre and has great scenes with Sutherland. Tom Skerritt is amazing as Duke Forrest,Hawkeye and Trapper's friend. Sally Kellerman is fantastic as Major Hot Lips O'Houlihan,a straight laced nurse. Robert Duvall is wonderful as Major Frank Burns,an fellow Army Surgeon. Roger Bowen is terrific as Colonial Henry Blake,a man who's in charge of the MASH unit. Gary Burghoff is great as Corporal Radar,Blake right hand man. Burghoff also played the role on the television series. David Arkin is funny as Sgt. Major Vollmer,a by the book soldier. Jo Ann Plug is sensational and beautiful as Lt. Dish,Hawkeye's love interest. Fred Williamson is outstanding as Dr. Spearchucker Jones,a Football player who's now a surgeon. Michael Murphy is great as Me Lai Larston,a Surgeon in Japan. John Schuck is fantastic as Capt. Painless Waldowski,a dentist. G. Wood(General Hammond),Bud Cort(Private Boone)and Rene Auberjonois(Father John 'Dago Red' Mulcahy)give good performances as well. The direction by Robert Altman is brilliant,with Altman always moving the camera with zooms and close ups and giving the film a gritty and realistic look. Great direction by Altman. The score by Johnny Mandel is fantastic and memorable and brings a light and fun feeling to the film. I also love the classic theme song Suicide Is Painless that is used for the film(and later for the television series)and it truly matches the film's tone. In final word,if you love Robert Altman,Comedies,Black Comedies,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see MASH,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    To me, Altman's second-best film, behind "Nashville," which is so uniquely brilliant, it defies classification! Regardless of it being set during the Korean War, this is obviously a commentary on the insanity of the current-at-that-time Vietnam War, and of war in general. The surgeons are endlessly patching up the badly wounded, and they keep coming. The endless cycle leads to the surgeons and other personnel just trying to keep sane. There is quite of mix of gore and laughs as the characters make their way through the conflict. And, surreal moments that transcend it all. Altman was a master at breaking the rules, and has a dream cast that makes the film perfect. I saw this at the 75th Anniversary for 20th Century Fox at Lincoln Center in 2010. I got to meet and have a real conversation with Elliott Gould, easily the best interaction with a celebrity I have ever had. There was a showing of a new 35mm print of the film, and a post discussion with Elliott, Tom Skerritt, and the wife of Mr. Altman. I even have a signed poster! Excellent film, easily watchable again and again. And, the P.A. announcements are so very funny! ********** (10 Out of 10 Stars)

    The film MASH opens with the arrival of Captain Pierce and Duke Forrest in an army field hospital as sergeants during the Korean War and ends with their departure. And in between we have the life of men and women in the camp. There are little pieces of stories and incidents we get to know about, some of them are funny, some disgusting and some empty. It's very difficult to talk about the film, not because it's obscure but because it is vastly pointless. It becomes quite clear that Robert Altman tried his best to make a film out of these little pieces, and that is probably the biggest drawback of the film - his effort shows. I won't blame Jean Luc Godard for not being able to tell a story the way it should be told, because his intentions were never to do so. He can be criticized for what he tried not for what he didn't. But unfortunately, Altman's success or failure in MASH should be judged in terms of these stories through which he tries to get inside this Army field hospital and of course the way he puts it. Looking back at a film like MASH made around 40 years ago, it is quite difficult to figure out the reasons behind its popularity, and hey, it's far from experimental too. The question is what is the film then? What is it about? Well, it's kind of a comedy which doesn't make you laugh that much. It's kind of an anti-war film that doesn't have much to say against war. It's kind of a psychological endeavor that doesn't penetrate. The film, MASH, is careless and indiscipline one, very much like the characters it depicts. MASH is probably a satirical, bit circus tic, black and bleak comedy  mostly ineffective. I think MASH is a war film that, fortunately, has nothing to do with heroism, bravery, patriotism or honor  instead it's about sadism, cruelty, cowardice and utter stupidity. I feel sad at the end of the film precisely because of its inability to take this influential project further. It fails to build up the characters it portrays. We are never at home with them; we don't know how to react. These characters never grow; they provide us no reason to follow them. Think about the football match sequence, all of a sudden we have a football match coming up from nowhere, and that too an elaborated coverage, the whole thing was absolutely rubbish and the film could have been better without it. Think about the suicide drama, think about the Korean boy they all seem stories out of place - we don't know them; we aren't linked. There are certain things that I find very disgusting too, for example, the way the film portrays the female character, hot lips. She arrives in the camp with a mission; she finds the whole atmosphere in the camp very messy and unorganized. She talks about discipline and order, and throughout the rest of the film she is mocked by everyone. She almost becomes a ridiculous and stupid creature, readily available for everything. She only finds Frank, but even Frank is forced to leave the field hospital by Captain Pierce and others. Hot lips' privacy is badly hampered twice, once when she is having sex with Frank, someone puts the microphone inside the room, and the whole hospital gets to hear the sounds. Secondly, all the temporary curtains were taken off while she is taking a bath, and she is exposed fully in front of everybody seated outside, with even musical instruments, a gallant show of laughter and disdain, and a worst possible part of the film for me. She is further ridiculed when she goes to the room of the officer in charge or whatever to complain about all these, we see her absolutely unable to make her point being angry and ends up shouting and crying, saying nothing. She is ridiculous, vague, overtly emotional and probably stretched as far as someone crazy. I don't know what Robert Altman wanted to achieve by all these, cruelty, disrespect, irresponsibility, perversion, voyeurism of these people in the military field hospital? May be, but since his whole project is a failure, at the end, it seems a perversion on the part of the director and nothing else. Hey, MASH won one of the most prestigious film awards of all, the P'lm Dore at the Cannes film festival in 1970, something it doesn't deserve, really.

    When I first saw "Mash" back in 1970 or thereabouts I was certain that it was a masterpiece of filmmaking. Over the years, I've had occasion to see it several more times, and each time it's diminished a bit. It's obvious that the movie only masquerades as being about "Korea", this is about Viet Nam. In that light it's interesting that the humor seemed much easier to accept while the war in Viet Nam was still playing in our living rooms every night. It was irreverent and "in-your-face", but a viable counterpoint to the horror of what was actually going on in S.E. Asia. Since the war is - thankfully - long since over, the humor now seems simply mean-spirited and thoughtless.And Hawkeye and Trapper are simple smart-ass jerks. There's little noteworthy outside of the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper. Radar is pleasant enough, Hotlips and Frank Burns are just uncomfortable to watch. The rest is simply wallpaper. I guess my conclusion is that this was a movie for the moment. It doesn't hold up well now with 40 years of history under the bridge.

    No idea why this movie is considered to be a genre classic really. I don't know, perhaps I needed to be around at 1970 to fully understand its appeal and appreciate it, since it certainly was a popular movie at the time, that even had an even more successful TV-series following it up, only 2 years later. Thing that the movie is known and praised for, is its heavy anti-war message in it. Well, not a message really but it makes a statement by turning a war situation into something comical. Perhaps this was something that really spoke to people at the time because of America's involved with the Vietnam war. In that regard, this movie is perhaps being a bit too much a product of its time and has lost it relevance and impact. But that does not make a bad movie of course. What does make this movie quite bad is that it simply isn't very fun or funny to watch at all. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I chuckled just once. The rest of the movie mostly consists out of people talking over each other and behaving incredibly immature. This was another real problem I had with this movie; All of the characters behaved like a bunch of brats and really not one of them was being likable enough for me. This was perhaps the biggest reason why I just couldn't ever enjoy watching this movie. But really, another big problem of the movie for me was that it didn't even featured a main story in it. It made this movie come across as a real pointless one, that was never being good, interesting or funny enough. It just isn't going anywhere with any of it. Perhaps it was to show the whole pointlessness of war but this doesn't make the movie any more pleasant or good to follow. Maybe it would had also helped if the movie did actually showed some of its war but now I really never had the feeling as if the movie was taking place during a war situation. The cast-list sound interesting, with people such as Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall and Rene Auberjonois in it but most of them were still pretty big unknowns at the time and their roles also aren't all that big. The movie doesn't have one main character in it but it instead focuses on a whole bunch of them, for an equal amount of time. This could work, if all of the characters would had been great or fun ones but that really wasn't the case for this movie. Not a completely horrible movie but not a very great or enjoyable one either. No way I will be ever seeing this one again! 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
