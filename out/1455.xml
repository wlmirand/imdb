 <sinopse>
  Western legends Pat Garrett, Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid are played against each other over the law and the attentions of vivacious country vixen Rio McDonald.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Newly appointed sheriff Pat Garrett is pleased when his old friend Doc Holliday arrives in Lincoln, New Mexico on the stage. Doc is trailing his stolen horse, and it is discovered in the possession of Billy the Kid. In a surprising turnaround, Billy and Doc become friends. This causes the friendship between Doc and Pat to cool. The odd relationship between Doc and Billy grows stranger when Doc hides Billy at his girl, Rio's, place after Billy is shot. She falls for Billy, although he treats her very badly. Interaction between these four is played out against an Indian attack before a final showdown reduces the group's number.

    I don't know if Howard Hughes was gay like some commentators maintain. I do know he was bat-shiat crazy. So the constant betrayal and backstabbing and shifting alliances are easy to see coming from his frightened mind. As a technical worker Hughes was also an Asperger's sufferer, who values things more than human relationships and can't understand humans anyway. So we see a pouch of tobacco and a horse traded around as casually as they do Jane Russell. Did anyone mention Johnny Carson's introduction of her on his show? "Here they are, Jane Russell." What disturbed me was her voice over-- what do you call it-- Foley stage? She sounds like a 12-year-old. Its quite off-putting and makes the creepiness of Hollywood shine through. So the lack of human motivations and operations give this a one star. But even if Howard Hughes knew how human beings felt or operated, the musical score would get this a one-star. Good gosh, is veered between over-dramatic Hitchcock and the Three Stooges (wha whaa whaaaa). In between was what others have described as bad Tchaikovsky. As you would expect for the guy that gave us Citizen Kane, the cinematography was pretty good. I bet I would have liked this a lot better if I turned off the sound. Closed-captioning would be far preferable to the wooden delivery and bad score. Double triple spoiler-- I do love the effect when Doc shoots big chunks out of Billy's ears. We need more of this in-camera stuff, CGI is boring me to tears. Now that the film is ending, I think of that guy that said it only makes sense if Pat, Doc, and Billy are gay, and he may have a point. But let's face it, if any real 1940s homosexuals were behind this film, it would be 100 times better. Quadruple spoiler-- Its nice that Doc dies saying he don't want to die in bed, and Val Kilmer picks up the meme in Tombstone. As a movie this is execrable, but as an exploration into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic Asperger suffer, it is a real treasure. I love how Hughes makes all the elements of a Jane Russell soft-core porno, since he has so little understanding of human beings he thinks that is the only reason we would watch this. Then again, maybe he was right.

    My oh my, I've seen some butt ugly films in 67 years but I must say that this piece of junk was the worst. A two hour monstrosity that took me a half a day to plow through. I picked this film up at a thrift store for 50 cents and now I know why. I thought it would be a classic, but I should have known better when I saw Howard Hughes on the box. The dialog was idiotic at best and the story was totally absurd and boring to tears. The three male main characters came right out of a bath house for sure. Sorry I had to give this abortion a 1 as I had no choice of a zero. Thank God for Jane Russells magnificent breasts.....all was not lost.

    This movie isn't a masterpiece but its rather fun and good to watch. Love the soundtrack when Billy has facial expressions and doesn't trust anyone. Jack buetel should have had a bigger popularity....sure he wasn't perfect but he was a kid then and i thought he rendered his role quite well. Very good looking and with charisma it is a mystery to me why his career didn't flourish. Walter Houston was admirable and we could feel his emotions easily..that is the result of a great actor. Thomas Mitchell equal to himself...never does a bad performance. The story line is simple but yet we are tempted to watch the film because of its fast pacing. There are lots of flaws but i liked it anyways...only Jane Russell didn't get to me....she is bland...has no dialogue...and had the stupidest facial expressions ever. Yes a fun movie that i urge you to see with the mentally of the 1943 era.

    this movie really surprised me. nothing from this era of American movies was like this i've ever seen. you can not think of this as bad acting as some reviewers will say. you have to think of this as "true" acting: they are acting the way people act in real life. not the way we are used to seeing them on camera. this "kid" is like every hardass street punk with a horrible childhood i ever met. you can see the emotional depravity in his gaze on the other characters. his unflinching at being grazed across the hand and shot through the ears; as hard as a hardass can be. crying inside but not letting these people the satisfaction of knowing it. us just waiting for him to retaliate but him having the satisfaction of putting Doc through the heartache. the sexual tension and innuendos between jane and jack are more like modern movies than something from this era. i bet many people left disgusted and went and complained to their pastor they were "demonized" by this movie. many others probably wondered why other films didn't come so close to reality. not gay in any way. 'f' the homos just wishing it was.

    Howard Hughes directed this awful film. The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters, especially Walter Huston, just say their dialogue and that's that. Huston was terribly miscast as Doc Holliday. Thomas Mitchell has his moments, especially at the end of the film with his outburst. Even with her voluptuous bosom, Jane Russell is often churlish. The film might have been better had it went into further detail about the great friendship that Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid had. Certainly, Holliday taught The Kid humanity and probably he paid with that with his life. Trusting each other is another great theme of the film. We just can't trust the directing, speech and total boredom, especially during the first half-hour of this film. Even the Indians don't engage us.

    Contains major spoilers. People have been totally slamming this movie, and I don't feel that's completely fair, since the photography is pretty good. OK, so the acting (if you can call it that: it's more like reciting lines) is wooden. The screen-writing is hilarious, and not because this is supposed to be a comedy (or was it? I've seen this three times and I'm still not sure). Maybe it's supposed to be British humor, where all absurd situations get treated as if it were normal: Example 1: Doc's girlfriend falls in love with Billy, and Doc appears upset but doesn't display any emotion. Example 2: Doc shoots Garrett's friends, and Garrett says - with a straight face - something akin to "this isn't going to help our friendship". Oh yes - and the music is sometimes vaudevillian comedy style, usually at inappropriate times. I've usually limited my bad movie watching to science fiction or drama...and now I can add a Western to the mix. Highly recommended.

    Seems like boobs were the stars--writing and characters FAR less important. Back when "The Outlaw" was completed, the film sat on the shelf for two years because it was considered unacceptable for the public. The Production Code was pretty much ignored and theater after theater either refused to show it or the local legal authorities threatened to jail the owners of the theaters. What was so indecent about this film? Apparently Jane Russell's breasts--and the many cleavage shots you see of her. However, you never see her breasts and by today's standards, it's actually a pretty tame film. Unfortunately, all this controversy made this film famous. I say unfortunately because after finally getting around to seeing it, it's a terrible movie! It seems that although the producer, Howard Hughes, took TONS of efforts to film the breast just right, no effort was made to get a script worth filming. The dialog is terrible, the film amazingly talky (VERY VERY VERY talky) and dull and historically speaking, it's even worse than the usual western about the semi-mythical heroes of the west. Speaking of getting the history wrong, there is no concrete evidence that Billy the Kid (a rather minor outlaw, by the way) knew or met Doc Holliday. But, what we DO know is that Holliday was NOT killed by Pat Garrett like he was in this film. He died in a sanitarium in Colorado of Tuberculosis!! In fact, most of the film is just made up junk--much of which was deliberately peppered with sexual innuendo. In one scene, it appears as if Billy the Kid rapes a lady (Russell) and she later falls in love with him (a VILE clich&eacute; to say the least)! There are also scenes between them where she needs to cut off his clothes to save his life and it's STRONGLY implied she got naked with him to keep him warm! Pretty spicy stuff for 1941 (when the film was completed) but the rest of the film is so dumb and flat that the ONLY thing of interest is all the innuendo! I will point out that the acting was generally pretty bad. Walter Huston was such a good actor that in spite of everything, his scenes were decent. As for newcomers Jack Buetel and Jane Russell, they were simply awful--and the director did nothing to pull convincing performances from them. But the worst actor in this one was Thomas Mitchell, as he was a very experienced actor and STILL did a bunch of crappy scenes (especially near the end). Overall, there's NOTHING to like about this film aside from Russell's pulchritude. By the way, didn't anyone think to tell Russell that she kept BADLY mispronouncing 'Guadalupe' throughout the film--even though the lady was supposed to be her aunt? Also, if you go to New Mexico, you can visit Billy's graves. Yes, I say graveS because there's one near the roadway that is for tourists and the REAL one nearby. And yes, in real life Pat Garrett DEFINITELY killed Billy in the end--but not in this dopey film.

    When notorious outlaw Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) arrives in town, he is greeted with open arms by local sheriff and best friend Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell). It's not long before Holliday comes across Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel), who seems to be riding Holliday's horse that he had stolen from him in a previous town. Holliday however, takes a liking to the cocky Kid much to the annoyance of Garrett. When the Kid kills a man that pulls a gun on him first, Garrett shoots the Kid but Holliday escapes with him, taking him to Rio's (Jane Russell) place. Rio is Holliday's lady but as she is tending to his wounds, she finds herself unable to resist the Kid's charms. Multi-millionaire playboy and aviator Howard Hughes only made two films in his life (although he produced many more). I've not seen his first film, Hell's Angels (1930), which is a love-song to aviation, but this, an unconventional cross-genre western, shows his complete inexperience in the role of director. Apart from the blatant historical inaccuracies (which I'll forgive, given the film is clearly not striving for it), Hughes seems unable to decide what genre he wants the film to be. Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? Who knows? One thing is clear, he is fascinated by Jane Russell's ample bosom. He felt that the film was not doing her breasts justice, and so he designed an early wonderbra that accentuated them. This generated lots of controversy, and led to the film only getting a limited release as it fell foul of the censors. Clearly, Hughes knows that Jane Russell's sexual appeal is all that the film has going for it, judging by the posters. Apart from the terrible script and dodgy pacing, the acting is absolutely woeful. Jack Buetel, clearly hired for his looks alone, has less charisma about him than the horses he rides on. In fact, the horses have more facial expressions. Jane Russell, who would go on to be a massive star, demonstrates none of her acting ability and feistiness that she would become known for. In fairness, she is given nothing to do other than bend over Buetel with her cleavage visible, and pout occasionally when required. The most confusing thing about this film is how Hughes expects us to like these characters. Pat Garrett is supposed to the 'bad' guy, jealous and furious over Holliday choosing to ride off with Billy the Kid. Yet as he pursues the Kid, who is by the way, a known thief and murderer, Doc Holliday shoots and kills many of Garrett's men. But somehow we are supposed to sympathise with Holliday and forget that he is a mass- murderer. It all plays out like some weird, homoerotic love story, with Garrett playing the jealous wife to Holliday's husband who has chosen to run off with Billy the Kid's younger, more exciting toyboy. The only female character of note, Rio, acts like a lost little girl who can't exist without a man's arm to lean on. The Kid treats her like s**t, and even tries to trade her for a horse, yet she remains enamoured with him, running after him when he 'allows' her to come with him. It's just a very strange, confused film. And also a very bad one.

    Jack Buetel (September 5, 1915  June 27, 1989) was an American film and television actor. Born in Dallas, Texas, Buetel moved to Los Angeles, California in the late 1930s with the intention of establishing a film career. Unable to find such work, he was employed as an insurance clerk when he was noticed by an agent who was impressed by his looks. Introduced to Howard Hughes, who was about to begin filming The Outlaw, Buetel was signed to play the lead role as Billy the Kid, with the previously signed David Bacon being dropped from the film. Hughes also signed another newcomer, Jane Russell, for the female lead, and realizing the inexperience of his two stars, also signed veteran actors Thomas Mitchell and Walter Huston. Buetel was signed to a standard seven-year contract at $150 per week and was assured by Hughes that he would become a major star. Filmed in late 1940 and early 1941, The Outlaw officially premiered in 1943 but was not widely seen until 1946. It was notable for suggesting the act of sexual intercourse, uncommon in mainstream movies of the era, and for allowing characters to "sin on film", without a suitable punishment also being depicted, in violation of the Production Code. Much of the publicity surrounding the release of the film focused on Jane Russell, and she established a solid film career, despite critics giving her performance in The Outlaw poor reviews. Buetel's performance was also highly criticised, and he languished with Hughes refusing to allow him to work. The director Howard Hawks tried to secure his services for the film Red River (1948), but after Hughes refused to allow Buetel to take part, Montgomery Clift was chosen and Clift went on to an active film career. In 1951 Buetel appeared in Best of the Badmen, his first film appearance in eleven years. Over the next few years he appeared in five more films, and made infrequent appearances on television. In 1956, he landed the role of 41-year-old Jeff Taggert in Edgar Buchanan's syndication western series, Judge Roy Bean. Others who appeared regularly in the 39-episode series, set in Langtry, Texas, were Jackie Loughery, X Brands, Tristram Coffin, Glenn Strange, and Lash La Rue. Buetel's last acting role was in a 1961 episode of Wagon Train. He also appeared as himself in the 1982 Night of 100 Stars television special. He died in Portland, Oregon, and was buried at Portland Memorial Park. The first time I saw this movie was in 1950 in a local cinema in Barcelona,(​​double session). in those days was something daring for a film the scenes between Jack Russell and Jean Beutel, although personally I was impressed mainly by the beauty of Jane Russell. I love the way the plot of the film, especially by the end of the story, unlike some other versions as to the truth of whether it was who killed Pat Garrett Billy the Kid. I prefer this ending for me was a surprise. It was a pity that Howard Hughes thus ruin the career of a good actor like Jack Beutel, but it also happened with other very good players, which ended up being ignored and forgotten. back to the movie I liked a lot. photography is excellent, the normal dialogs, the correct interpretation, since the lack of a good director and best screenplay had yielded better results. definitely a good movie.

    Stories of the old West abound and Hollywood is no stranger to putting them onto the silver screen. However, tinsel town is not very careful when it comes to historical accuracy. Take this film for instance, the original script was written by Jules Furthman, for a special project directed by none other than Howard Hughes. The movie is called " The Outlaw " and is supposedly one of a few the late Hughes touted as his best. However, playing fast and loose with history is sure to cause historians to scratch their heads. In this fanciful tale, audiences are treated to a make believe story wherein we have two western legends 'Billy the Kid' aka, William Bonny (Jack Beutel) and 'Doc Holiday' aka, John Henry Holiday (Walter Huston) arriving in Lincoln, New Mexico and becoming fast friends. Unlikely as that is, we are also treated to Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) who comes to dislike both men. Not because they are outlaws, but because they form a closer bond which many suggest boarders on the suspicious. Jane Russell is the Buxom bombshell Rio McDonald, who was the surprising sex-sensation and X-rated Eye-candy of the 1940s. The actors are likable enough and carry the fictional story along to it's rather slow, almost torturous ending. The motion picture has its ardent proponents, which equal it's cinematic detractors. However, the special reason why this film is sought after is due to its depiction of Jan Russell in a 'super' bra (Which she never wore). Indeed, I watched the movie with anticipation and realized in the year 2010 we have a whole plethora of "Full-Figure' want-to-be's who've revealed more than Russell ever did. I believe that were it not for the trashing of western myths, this movie might rank as a Classic, but as it is, many would warn its director to stick to airplanes. ****

    Seems like boobs were the stars--writing and characters FAR less important. Back when "The Outlaw" was completed, the film sat on the shelf for two years because it was considered unacceptable for the public. The Production Code was pretty much ignored and theater after theater either refused to show it or the local legal authorities threatened to jail the owners of the theaters. What was so indecent about this film? Apparently Jane Russell's breasts--and the many cleavage shots you see of her. However, you never see her breasts and by today's standards, it's actually a pretty tame film. Unfortunately, all this controversy made this film famous. I say unfortunately because after finally getting around to seeing it, it's a terrible movie! It seems that although the producer, Howard Hughes, took TONS of efforts to film the breast just right, no effort was made to get a script worth filming. The dialog is terrible, the film amazingly talky (VERY VERY VERY talky) and dull and historically speaking, it's even worse than the usual western about the semi-mythical heroes of the west. Speaking of getting the history wrong, there is no concrete evidence that Billy the Kid (a rather minor outlaw, by the way) knew or met Doc Holliday. But, what we DO know is that Holliday was NOT killed by Pat Garrett like he was in this film. He died in a sanitarium in Colorado of Tuberculosis!! In fact, most of the film is just made up junk--much of which was deliberately peppered with sexual innuendo. In one scene, it appears as if Billy the Kid rapes a lady (Russell) and she later falls in love with him (a VILE clich&eacute; to say the least)! There are also scenes between them where she needs to cut off his clothes to save his life and it's STRONGLY implied she got naked with him to keep him warm! Pretty spicy stuff for 1941 (when the film was completed) but the rest of the film is so dumb and flat that the ONLY thing of interest is all the innuendo! I will point out that the acting was generally pretty bad. Walter Huston was such a good actor that in spite of everything, his scenes were decent. As for newcomers Jack Buetel and Jane Russell, they were simply awful--and the director did nothing to pull convincing performances from them. But the worst actor in this one was Thomas Mitchell, as he was a very experienced actor and STILL did a bunch of crappy scenes (especially near the end). Overall, there's NOTHING to like about this film aside from Russell's pulchritude. By the way, didn't anyone think to tell Russell that she kept BADLY mispronouncing 'Guadalupe' throughout the film--even though the lady was supposed to be her aunt? Also, if you go to New Mexico, you can visit Billy's graves. Yes, I say graveS because there's one near the roadway that is for tourists and the REAL one nearby. And yes, in real life Pat Garrett DEFINITELY killed Billy in the end--but not in this dopey film.

    When notorious outlaw Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) arrives in town, he is greeted with open arms by local sheriff and best friend Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell). It's not long before Holliday comes across Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel), who seems to be riding Holliday's horse that he had stolen from him in a previous town. Holliday however, takes a liking to the cocky Kid much to the annoyance of Garrett. When the Kid kills a man that pulls a gun on him first, Garrett shoots the Kid but Holliday escapes with him, taking him to Rio's (Jane Russell) place. Rio is Holliday's lady but as she is tending to his wounds, she finds herself unable to resist the Kid's charms. Multi-millionaire playboy and aviator Howard Hughes only made two films in his life (although he produced many more). I've not seen his first film, Hell's Angels (1930), which is a love-song to aviation, but this, an unconventional cross-genre western, shows his complete inexperience in the role of director. Apart from the blatant historical inaccuracies (which I'll forgive, given the film is clearly not striving for it), Hughes seems unable to decide what genre he wants the film to be. Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? Who knows? One thing is clear, he is fascinated by Jane Russell's ample bosom. He felt that the film was not doing her breasts justice, and so he designed an early wonderbra that accentuated them. This generated lots of controversy, and led to the film only getting a limited release as it fell foul of the censors. Clearly, Hughes knows that Jane Russell's sexual appeal is all that the film has going for it, judging by the posters. Apart from the terrible script and dodgy pacing, the acting is absolutely woeful. Jack Buetel, clearly hired for his looks alone, has less charisma about him than the horses he rides on. In fact, the horses have more facial expressions. Jane Russell, who would go on to be a massive star, demonstrates none of her acting ability and feistiness that she would become known for. In fairness, she is given nothing to do other than bend over Buetel with her cleavage visible, and pout occasionally when required. The most confusing thing about this film is how Hughes expects us to like these characters. Pat Garrett is supposed to the 'bad' guy, jealous and furious over Holliday choosing to ride off with Billy the Kid. Yet as he pursues the Kid, who is by the way, a known thief and murderer, Doc Holliday shoots and kills many of Garrett's men. But somehow we are supposed to sympathise with Holliday and forget that he is a mass- murderer. It all plays out like some weird, homoerotic love story, with Garrett playing the jealous wife to Holliday's husband who has chosen to run off with Billy the Kid's younger, more exciting toyboy. The only female character of note, Rio, acts like a lost little girl who can't exist without a man's arm to lean on. The Kid treats her like s**t, and even tries to trade her for a horse, yet she remains enamoured with him, running after him when he 'allows' her to come with him. It's just a very strange, confused film. And also a very bad one.

    Jack Buetel (September 5, 1915  June 27, 1989) was an American film and television actor. Born in Dallas, Texas, Buetel moved to Los Angeles, California in the late 1930s with the intention of establishing a film career. Unable to find such work, he was employed as an insurance clerk when he was noticed by an agent who was impressed by his looks. Introduced to Howard Hughes, who was about to begin filming The Outlaw, Buetel was signed to play the lead role as Billy the Kid, with the previously signed David Bacon being dropped from the film. Hughes also signed another newcomer, Jane Russell, for the female lead, and realizing the inexperience of his two stars, also signed veteran actors Thomas Mitchell and Walter Huston. Buetel was signed to a standard seven-year contract at $150 per week and was assured by Hughes that he would become a major star. Filmed in late 1940 and early 1941, The Outlaw officially premiered in 1943 but was not widely seen until 1946. It was notable for suggesting the act of sexual intercourse, uncommon in mainstream movies of the era, and for allowing characters to "sin on film", without a suitable punishment also being depicted, in violation of the Production Code. Much of the publicity surrounding the release of the film focused on Jane Russell, and she established a solid film career, despite critics giving her performance in The Outlaw poor reviews. Buetel's performance was also highly criticised, and he languished with Hughes refusing to allow him to work. The director Howard Hawks tried to secure his services for the film Red River (1948), but after Hughes refused to allow Buetel to take part, Montgomery Clift was chosen and Clift went on to an active film career. In 1951 Buetel appeared in Best of the Badmen, his first film appearance in eleven years. Over the next few years he appeared in five more films, and made infrequent appearances on television. In 1956, he landed the role of 41-year-old Jeff Taggert in Edgar Buchanan's syndication western series, Judge Roy Bean. Others who appeared regularly in the 39-episode series, set in Langtry, Texas, were Jackie Loughery, X Brands, Tristram Coffin, Glenn Strange, and Lash La Rue. Buetel's last acting role was in a 1961 episode of Wagon Train. He also appeared as himself in the 1982 Night of 100 Stars television special. He died in Portland, Oregon, and was buried at Portland Memorial Park. The first time I saw this movie was in 1950 in a local cinema in Barcelona,(​​double session). in those days was something daring for a film the scenes between Jack Russell and Jean Beutel, although personally I was impressed mainly by the beauty of Jane Russell. I love the way the plot of the film, especially by the end of the story, unlike some other versions as to the truth of whether it was who killed Pat Garrett Billy the Kid. I prefer this ending for me was a surprise. It was a pity that Howard Hughes thus ruin the career of a good actor like Jack Beutel, but it also happened with other very good players, which ended up being ignored and forgotten. back to the movie I liked a lot. photography is excellent, the normal dialogs, the correct interpretation, since the lack of a good director and best screenplay had yielded better results. definitely a good movie.

    Stories of the old West abound and Hollywood is no stranger to putting them onto the silver screen. However, tinsel town is not very careful when it comes to historical accuracy. Take this film for instance, the original script was written by Jules Furthman, for a special project directed by none other than Howard Hughes. The movie is called " The Outlaw " and is supposedly one of a few the late Hughes touted as his best. However, playing fast and loose with history is sure to cause historians to scratch their heads. In this fanciful tale, audiences are treated to a make believe story wherein we have two western legends 'Billy the Kid' aka, William Bonny (Jack Beutel) and 'Doc Holiday' aka, John Henry Holiday (Walter Huston) arriving in Lincoln, New Mexico and becoming fast friends. Unlikely as that is, we are also treated to Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) who comes to dislike both men. Not because they are outlaws, but because they form a closer bond which many suggest boarders on the suspicious. Jane Russell is the Buxom bombshell Rio McDonald, who was the surprising sex-sensation and X-rated Eye-candy of the 1940s. The actors are likable enough and carry the fictional story along to it's rather slow, almost torturous ending. The motion picture has its ardent proponents, which equal it's cinematic detractors. However, the special reason why this film is sought after is due to its depiction of Jan Russell in a 'super' bra (Which she never wore). Indeed, I watched the movie with anticipation and realized in the year 2010 we have a whole plethora of "Full-Figure' want-to-be's who've revealed more than Russell ever did. I believe that were it not for the trashing of western myths, this movie might rank as a Classic, but as it is, many would warn its director to stick to airplanes. ****

    I don't know if Howard Hughes was gay like some commentators maintain. I do know he was bat-shiat crazy. So the constant betrayal and backstabbing and shifting alliances are easy to see coming from his frightened mind. As a technical worker Hughes was also an Asperger's sufferer, who values things more than human relationships and can't understand humans anyway. So we see a pouch of tobacco and a horse traded around as casually as they do Jane Russell. Did anyone mention Johnny Carson's introduction of her on his show? "Here they are, Jane Russell." What disturbed me was her voice over-- what do you call it-- Foley stage? She sounds like a 12-year-old. Its quite off-putting and makes the creepiness of Hollywood shine through. So the lack of human motivations and operations give this a one star. But even if Howard Hughes knew how human beings felt or operated, the musical score would get this a one-star. Good gosh, is veered between over-dramatic Hitchcock and the Three Stooges (wha whaa whaaaa). In between was what others have described as bad Tchaikovsky. As you would expect for the guy that gave us Citizen Kane, the cinematography was pretty good. I bet I would have liked this a lot better if I turned off the sound. Closed-captioning would be far preferable to the wooden delivery and bad score. Double triple spoiler-- I do love the effect when Doc shoots big chunks out of Billy's ears. We need more of this in-camera stuff, CGI is boring me to tears. Now that the film is ending, I think of that guy that said it only makes sense if Pat, Doc, and Billy are gay, and he may have a point. But let's face it, if any real 1940s homosexuals were behind this film, it would be 100 times better. Quadruple spoiler-- Its nice that Doc dies saying he don't want to die in bed, and Val Kilmer picks up the meme in Tombstone. As a movie this is execrable, but as an exploration into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic Asperger suffer, it is a real treasure. I love how Hughes makes all the elements of a Jane Russell soft-core porno, since he has so little understanding of human beings he thinks that is the only reason we would watch this. Then again, maybe he was right.

    My oh my, I've seen some butt ugly films in 67 years but I must say that this piece of junk was the worst. A two hour monstrosity that took me a half a day to plow through. I picked this film up at a thrift store for 50 cents and now I know why. I thought it would be a classic, but I should have known better when I saw Howard Hughes on the box. The dialog was idiotic at best and the story was totally absurd and boring to tears. The three male main characters came right out of a bath house for sure. Sorry I had to give this abortion a 1 as I had no choice of a zero. Thank God for Jane Russells magnificent breasts.....all was not lost.

    This movie isn't a masterpiece but its rather fun and good to watch. Love the soundtrack when Billy has facial expressions and doesn't trust anyone. Jack buetel should have had a bigger popularity....sure he wasn't perfect but he was a kid then and i thought he rendered his role quite well. Very good looking and with charisma it is a mystery to me why his career didn't flourish. Walter Houston was admirable and we could feel his emotions easily..that is the result of a great actor. Thomas Mitchell equal to himself...never does a bad performance. The story line is simple but yet we are tempted to watch the film because of its fast pacing. There are lots of flaws but i liked it anyways...only Jane Russell didn't get to me....she is bland...has no dialogue...and had the stupidest facial expressions ever. Yes a fun movie that i urge you to see with the mentally of the 1943 era.

    this movie really surprised me. nothing from this era of American movies was like this i've ever seen. you can not think of this as bad acting as some reviewers will say. you have to think of this as "true" acting: they are acting the way people act in real life. not the way we are used to seeing them on camera. this "kid" is like every hardass street punk with a horrible childhood i ever met. you can see the emotional depravity in his gaze on the other characters. his unflinching at being grazed across the hand and shot through the ears; as hard as a hardass can be. crying inside but not letting these people the satisfaction of knowing it. us just waiting for him to retaliate but him having the satisfaction of putting Doc through the heartache. the sexual tension and innuendos between jane and jack are more like modern movies than something from this era. i bet many people left disgusted and went and complained to their pastor they were "demonized" by this movie. many others probably wondered why other films didn't come so close to reality. not gay in any way. 'f' the homos just wishing it was.

    Howard Hughes directed this awful film. The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters, especially Walter Huston, just say their dialogue and that's that. Huston was terribly miscast as Doc Holliday. Thomas Mitchell has his moments, especially at the end of the film with his outburst. Even with her voluptuous bosom, Jane Russell is often churlish. The film might have been better had it went into further detail about the great friendship that Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid had. Certainly, Holliday taught The Kid humanity and probably he paid with that with his life. Trusting each other is another great theme of the film. We just can't trust the directing, speech and total boredom, especially during the first half-hour of this film. Even the Indians don't engage us.

    Contains major spoilers. People have been totally slamming this movie, and I don't feel that's completely fair, since the photography is pretty good. OK, so the acting (if you can call it that: it's more like reciting lines) is wooden. The screen-writing is hilarious, and not because this is supposed to be a comedy (or was it? I've seen this three times and I'm still not sure). Maybe it's supposed to be British humor, where all absurd situations get treated as if it were normal: Example 1: Doc's girlfriend falls in love with Billy, and Doc appears upset but doesn't display any emotion. Example 2: Doc shoots Garrett's friends, and Garrett says - with a straight face - something akin to "this isn't going to help our friendship". Oh yes - and the music is sometimes vaudevillian comedy style, usually at inappropriate times. I've usually limited my bad movie watching to science fiction or drama...and now I can add a Western to the mix. Highly recommended.

The actors are likable enough and carry the fictional story along to it's rather slow, almost torturous ending. The motion picture has its ardent proponents, which equal it's cinematic detractors. However, the special reason why this film is sought after is due to its depiction of Jan Russell in a 'super' bra (Which she never wore). Indeed, I watched the movie with anticipation and realized in the year 2010 we have a whole plethora of "Full-Figure' want-to-be's who've revealed more than Russell ever did. I believe that were it not for the trashing of western myths, this movie might rank as a Classic, but as it is, many would warn its director to stick to airplanes. ****

    I don't know if Howard Hughes was gay like some commentators maintain. I do know he was bat-shiat crazy. So the constant betrayal and backstabbing and shifting alliances are easy to see coming from his frightened mind. As a technical worker Hughes was also an Asperger's sufferer, who values things more than human relationships and can't understand humans anyway. So we see a pouch of tobacco and a horse traded around as casually as they do Jane Russell. Did anyone mention Johnny Carson's introduction of her on his show? "Here they are, Jane Russell." What disturbed me was her voice over-- what do you call it-- Foley stage? She sounds like a 12-year-old. Its quite off-putting and makes the creepiness of Hollywood shine through. So the lack of human motivations and operations give this a one star. But even if Howard Hughes knew how human beings felt or operated, the musical score would get this a one-star. Good gosh, is veered between over-dramatic Hitchcock and the Three Stooges (wha whaa whaaaa). In between was what others have described as bad Tchaikovsky. As you would expect for the guy that gave us Citizen Kane, the cinematography was pretty good. I bet I would have liked this a lot better if I turned off the sound. Closed-captioning would be far preferable to the wooden delivery and bad score. Double triple spoiler-- I do love the effect when Doc shoots big chunks out of Billy's ears. We need more of this in-camera stuff, CGI is boring me to tears. Now that the film is ending, I think of that guy that said it only makes sense if Pat, Doc, and Billy are gay, and he may have a point. But let's face it, if any real 1940s homosexuals were behind this film, it would be 100 times better. Quadruple spoiler-- Its nice that Doc dies saying he don't want to die in bed, and Val Kilmer picks up the meme in Tombstone. As a movie this is execrable, but as an exploration into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic Asperger suffer, it is a real treasure. I love how Hughes makes all the elements of a Jane Russell soft-core porno, since he has so little understanding of human beings he thinks that is the only reason we would watch this. Then again, maybe he was right.

    My oh my, I've seen some butt ugly films in 67 years but I must say that this piece of junk was the worst. A two hour monstrosity that took me a half a day to plow through. I picked this film up at a thrift store for 50 cents and now I know why. I thought it would be a classic, but I should have known better when I saw Howard Hughes on the box. The dialog was idiotic at best and the story was totally absurd and boring to tears. The three male main characters came right out of a bath house for sure. Sorry I had to give this abortion a 1 as I had no choice of a zero. Thank God for Jane Russells magnificent breasts.....all was not lost.

    This movie isn't a masterpiece but its rather fun and good to watch. Love the soundtrack when Billy has facial expressions and doesn't trust anyone. Jack buetel should have had a bigger popularity....sure he wasn't perfect but he was a kid then and i thought he rendered his role quite well. Very good looking and with charisma it is a mystery to me why his career didn't flourish. Walter Houston was admirable and we could feel his emotions easily..that is the result of a great actor. Thomas Mitchell equal to himself...never does a bad performance. The story line is simple but yet we are tempted to watch the film because of its fast pacing. There are lots of flaws but i liked it anyways...only Jane Russell didn't get to me....she is bland...has no dialogue...and had the stupidest facial expressions ever. Yes a fun movie that i urge you to see with the mentally of the 1943 era.

    this movie really surprised me. nothing from this era of American movies was like this i've ever seen. you can not think of this as bad acting as some reviewers will say. you have to think of this as "true" acting: they are acting the way people act in real life. not the way we are used to seeing them on camera. this "kid" is like every hardass street punk with a horrible childhood i ever met. you can see the emotional depravity in his gaze on the other characters. his unflinching at being grazed across the hand and shot through the ears; as hard as a hardass can be. crying inside but not letting these people the satisfaction of knowing it. us just waiting for him to retaliate but him having the satisfaction of putting Doc through the heartache. the sexual tension and innuendos between jane and jack are more like modern movies than something from this era. i bet many people left disgusted and went and complained to their pastor they were "demonized" by this movie. many others probably wondered why other films didn't come so close to reality. not gay in any way. 'f' the homos just wishing it was.

    Howard Hughes directed this awful film. The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters, especially Walter Huston, just say their dialogue and that's that. Huston was terribly miscast as Doc Holliday. Thomas Mitchell has his moments, especially at the end of the film with his outburst. Even with her voluptuous bosom, Jane Russell is often churlish. The film might have been better had it went into further detail about the great friendship that Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid had. Certainly, Holliday taught The Kid humanity and probably he paid with that with his life. Trusting each other is another great theme of the film. We just can't trust the directing, speech and total boredom, especially during the first half-hour of this film. Even the Indians don't engage us.

    Contains major spoilers. People have been totally slamming this movie, and I don't feel that's completely fair, since the photography is pretty good. OK, so the acting (if you can call it that: it's more like reciting lines) is wooden. The screen-writing is hilarious, and not because this is supposed to be a comedy (or was it? I've seen this three times and I'm still not sure). Maybe it's supposed to be British humor, where all absurd situations get treated as if it were normal: Example 1: Doc's girlfriend falls in love with Billy, and Doc appears upset but doesn't display any emotion. Example 2: Doc shoots Garrett's friends, and Garrett says - with a straight face - something akin to "this isn't going to help our friendship". Oh yes - and the music is sometimes vaudevillian comedy style, usually at inappropriate times. I've usually limited my bad movie watching to science fiction or drama...and now I can add a Western to the mix. Highly recommended.

    Seems like boobs were the stars--writing and characters FAR less important. Back when "The Outlaw" was completed, the film sat on the shelf for two years because it was considered unacceptable for the public. The Production Code was pretty much ignored and theater after theater either refused to show it or the local legal authorities threatened to jail the owners of the theaters. What was so indecent about this film? Apparently Jane Russell's breasts--and the many cleavage shots you see of her. However, you never see her breasts and by today's standards, it's actually a pretty tame film. Unfortunately, all this controversy made this film famous. I say unfortunately because after finally getting around to seeing it, it's a terrible movie! It seems that although the producer, Howard Hughes, took TONS of efforts to film the breast just right, no effort was made to get a script worth filming. The dialog is terrible, the film amazingly talky (VERY VERY VERY talky) and dull and historically speaking, it's even worse than the usual western about the semi-mythical heroes of the west. Speaking of getting the history wrong, there is no concrete evidence that Billy the Kid (a rather minor outlaw, by the way) knew or met Doc Holliday. But, what we DO know is that Holliday was NOT killed by Pat Garrett like he was in this film. He died in a sanitarium in Colorado of Tuberculosis!! In fact, most of the film is just made up junk--much of which was deliberately peppered with sexual innuendo. In one scene, it appears as if Billy the Kid rapes a lady (Russell) and she later falls in love with him (a VILE clich&eacute; to say the least)! There are also scenes between them where she needs to cut off his clothes to save his life and it's STRONGLY implied she got naked with him to keep him warm! Pretty spicy stuff for 1941 (when the film was completed) but the rest of the film is so dumb and flat that the ONLY thing of interest is all the innuendo! I will point out that the acting was generally pretty bad. Walter Huston was such a good actor that in spite of everything, his scenes were decent. As for newcomers Jack Buetel and Jane Russell, they were simply awful--and the director did nothing to pull convincing performances from them. But the worst actor in this one was Thomas Mitchell, as he was a very experienced actor and STILL did a bunch of crappy scenes (especially near the end). Overall, there's NOTHING to like about this film aside from Russell's pulchritude. By the way, didn't anyone think to tell Russell that she kept BADLY mispronouncing 'Guadalupe' throughout the film--even though the lady was supposed to be her aunt? Also, if you go to New Mexico, you can visit Billy's graves. Yes, I say graveS because there's one near the roadway that is for tourists and the REAL one nearby. And yes, in real life Pat Garrett DEFINITELY killed Billy in the end--but not in this dopey film.

    When notorious outlaw Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) arrives in town, he is greeted with open arms by local sheriff and best friend Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell). It's not long before Holliday comes across Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel), who seems to be riding Holliday's horse that he had stolen from him in a previous town. Holliday however, takes a liking to the cocky Kid much to the annoyance of Garrett. When the Kid kills a man that pulls a gun on him first, Garrett shoots the Kid but Holliday escapes with him, taking him to Rio's (Jane Russell) place. Rio is Holliday's lady but as she is tending to his wounds, she finds herself unable to resist the Kid's charms. Multi-millionaire playboy and aviator Howard Hughes only made two films in his life (although he produced many more). I've not seen his first film, Hell's Angels (1930), which is a love-song to aviation, but this, an unconventional cross-genre western, shows his complete inexperience in the role of director. Apart from the blatant historical inaccuracies (which I'll forgive, given the film is clearly not striving for it), Hughes seems unable to decide what genre he wants the film to be. Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? Who knows? One thing is clear, he is fascinated by Jane Russell's ample bosom. He felt that the film was not doing her breasts justice, and so he designed an early wonderbra that accentuated them. This generated lots of controversy, and led to the film only getting a limited release as it fell foul of the censors. Clearly, Hughes knows that Jane Russell's sexual appeal is all that the film has going for it, judging by the posters. Apart from the terrible script and dodgy pacing, the acting is absolutely woeful. Jack Buetel, clearly hired for his looks alone, has less charisma about him than the horses he rides on. In fact, the horses have more facial expressions. Jane Russell, who would go on to be a massive star, demonstrates none of her acting ability and feistiness that she would become known for. In fairness, she is given nothing to do other than bend over Buetel with her cleavage visible, and pout occasionally when required. The most confusing thing about this film is how Hughes expects us to like these characters. Pat Garrett is supposed to the 'bad' guy, jealous and furious over Holliday choosing to ride off with Billy the Kid. Yet as he pursues the Kid, who is by the way, a known thief and murderer, Doc Holliday shoots and kills many of Garrett's men. But somehow we are supposed to sympathise with Holliday and forget that he is a mass- murderer. It all plays out like some weird, homoerotic love story, with Garrett playing the jealous wife to Holliday's husband who has chosen to run off with Billy the Kid's younger, more exciting toyboy. The only female character of note, Rio, acts like a lost little girl who can't exist without a man's arm to lean on. The Kid treats her like s**t, and even tries to trade her for a horse, yet she remains enamoured with him, running after him when he 'allows' her to come with him. It's just a very strange, confused film. And also a very bad one.

    Jack Buetel (September 5, 1915  June 27, 1989) was an American film and television actor. Born in Dallas, Texas, Buetel moved to Los Angeles, California in the late 1930s with the intention of establishing a film career. Unable to find such work, he was employed as an insurance clerk when he was noticed by an agent who was impressed by his looks. Introduced to Howard Hughes, who was about to begin filming The Outlaw, Buetel was signed to play the lead role as Billy the Kid, with the previously signed David Bacon being dropped from the film. Hughes also signed another newcomer, Jane Russell, for the female lead, and realizing the inexperience of his two stars, also signed veteran actors Thomas Mitchell and Walter Huston. Buetel was signed to a standard seven-year contract at $150 per week and was assured by Hughes that he would become a major star. Filmed in late 1940 and early 1941, The Outlaw officially premiered in 1943 but was not widely seen until 1946. It was notable for suggesting the act of sexual intercourse, uncommon in mainstream movies of the era, and for allowing characters to "sin on film", without a suitable punishment also being depicted, in violation of the Production Code. Much of the publicity surrounding the release of the film focused on Jane Russell, and she established a solid film career, despite critics giving her performance in The Outlaw poor reviews. Buetel's performance was also highly criticised, and he languished with Hughes refusing to allow him to work. The director Howard Hawks tried to secure his services for the film Red River (1948), but after Hughes refused to allow Buetel to take part, Montgomery Clift was chosen and Clift went on to an active film career. In 1951 Buetel appeared in Best of the Badmen, his first film appearance in eleven years. Over the next few years he appeared in five more films, and made infrequent appearances on television. In 1956, he landed the role of 41-year-old Jeff Taggert in Edgar Buchanan's syndication western series, Judge Roy Bean. Others who appeared regularly in the 39-episode series, set in Langtry, Texas, were Jackie Loughery, X Brands, Tristram Coffin, Glenn Strange, and Lash La Rue. Buetel's last acting role was in a 1961 episode of Wagon Train. He also appeared as himself in the 1982 Night of 100 Stars television special. He died in Portland, Oregon, and was buried at Portland Memorial Park. The first time I saw this movie was in 1950 in a local cinema in Barcelona,(​​double session). in those days was something daring for a film the scenes between Jack Russell and Jean Beutel, although personally I was impressed mainly by the beauty of Jane Russell. I love the way the plot of the film, especially by the end of the story, unlike some other versions as to the truth of whether it was who killed Pat Garrett Billy the Kid. I prefer this ending for me was a surprise. It was a pity that Howard Hughes thus ruin the career of a good actor like Jack Beutel, but it also happened with other very good players, which ended up being ignored and forgotten. back to the movie I liked a lot. photography is excellent, the normal dialogs, the correct interpretation, since the lack of a good director and best screenplay had yielded better results. definitely a good movie.

    Stories of the old West abound and Hollywood is no stranger to putting them onto the silver screen. However, tinsel town is not very careful when it comes to historical accuracy. Take this film for instance, the original script was written by Jules Furthman, for a special project directed by none other than Howard Hughes. The movie is called " The Outlaw " and is supposedly one of a few the late Hughes touted as his best. However, playing fast and loose with history is sure to cause historians to scratch their heads. In this fanciful tale, audiences are treated to a make believe story wherein we have two western legends 'Billy the Kid' aka, William Bonny (Jack Beutel) and 'Doc Holiday' aka, John Henry Holiday (Walter Huston) arriving in Lincoln, New Mexico and becoming fast friends. Unlikely as that is, we are also treated to Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) who comes to dislike both men. Not because they are outlaws, but because they form a closer bond which many suggest boarders on the suspicious. Jane Russell is the Buxom bombshell Rio McDonald, who was the surprising sex-sensation and X-rated Eye-candy of the 1940s. The actors are likable enough and carry the fictional story along to it's rather slow, almost torturous ending. The motion picture has its ardent proponents, which equal it's cinematic detractors. However, the special reason why this film is sought after is due to its depiction of Jan Russell in a 'super' bra (Which she never wore).

In one scene, it appears as if Billy the Kid rapes a lady (Russell) and she later falls in love with him (a VILE clich&eacute; to say the least)! There are also scenes between them where she needs to cut off his clothes to save his life and it's STRONGLY implied she got naked with him to keep him warm! Pretty spicy stuff for 1941 (when the film was completed) but the rest of the film is so dumb and flat that the ONLY thing of interest is all the innuendo! I will point out that the acting was generally pretty bad. Walter Huston was such a good actor that in spite of everything, his scenes were decent. As for newcomers Jack Buetel and Jane Russell, they were simply awful--and the director did nothing to pull convincing performances from them. But the worst actor in this one was Thomas Mitchell, as he was a very experienced actor and STILL did a bunch of crappy scenes (especially near the end). Overall, there's NOTHING to like about this film aside from Russell's pulchritude. By the way, didn't anyone think to tell Russell that she kept BADLY mispronouncing 'Guadalupe' throughout the film--even though the lady was supposed to be her aunt? Also, if you go to New Mexico, you can visit Billy's graves. Yes, I say graveS because there's one near the roadway that is for tourists and the REAL one nearby. And yes, in real life Pat Garrett DEFINITELY killed Billy in the end--but not in this dopey film.

    When notorious outlaw Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) arrives in town, he is greeted with open arms by local sheriff and best friend Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell). It's not long before Holliday comes across Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel), who seems to be riding Holliday's horse that he had stolen from him in a previous town. Holliday however, takes a liking to the cocky Kid much to the annoyance of Garrett. When the Kid kills a man that pulls a gun on him first, Garrett shoots the Kid but Holliday escapes with him, taking him to Rio's (Jane Russell) place. Rio is Holliday's lady but as she is tending to his wounds, she finds herself unable to resist the Kid's charms. Multi-millionaire playboy and aviator Howard Hughes only made two films in his life (although he produced many more). I've not seen his first film, Hell's Angels (1930), which is a love-song to aviation, but this, an unconventional cross-genre western, shows his complete inexperience in the role of director. Apart from the blatant historical inaccuracies (which I'll forgive, given the film is clearly not striving for it), Hughes seems unable to decide what genre he wants the film to be. Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? Who knows? One thing is clear, he is fascinated by Jane Russell's ample bosom. He felt that the film was not doing her breasts justice, and so he designed an early wonderbra that accentuated them. This generated lots of controversy, and led to the film only getting a limited release as it fell foul of the censors. Clearly, Hughes knows that Jane Russell's sexual appeal is all that the film has going for it, judging by the posters. Apart from the terrible script and dodgy pacing, the acting is absolutely woeful. Jack Buetel, clearly hired for his looks alone, has less charisma about him than the horses he rides on. In fact, the horses have more facial expressions. Jane Russell, who would go on to be a massive star, demonstrates none of her acting ability and feistiness that she would become known for. In fairness, she is given nothing to do other than bend over Buetel with her cleavage visible, and pout occasionally when required. The most confusing thing about this film is how Hughes expects us to like these characters. Pat Garrett is supposed to the 'bad' guy, jealous and furious over Holliday choosing to ride off with Billy the Kid. Yet as he pursues the Kid, who is by the way, a known thief and murderer, Doc Holliday shoots and kills many of Garrett's men. But somehow we are supposed to sympathise with Holliday and forget that he is a mass- murderer. It all plays out like some weird, homoerotic love story, with Garrett playing the jealous wife to Holliday's husband who has chosen to run off with Billy the Kid's younger, more exciting toyboy. The only female character of note, Rio, acts like a lost little girl who can't exist without a man's arm to lean on. The Kid treats her like s**t, and even tries to trade her for a horse, yet she remains enamoured with him, running after him when he 'allows' her to come with him. It's just a very strange, confused film. And also a very bad one.

    Jack Buetel (September 5, 1915  June 27, 1989) was an American film and television actor. Born in Dallas, Texas, Buetel moved to Los Angeles, California in the late 1930s with the intention of establishing a film career. Unable to find such work, he was employed as an insurance clerk when he was noticed by an agent who was impressed by his looks. Introduced to Howard Hughes, who was about to begin filming The Outlaw, Buetel was signed to play the lead role as Billy the Kid, with the previously signed David Bacon being dropped from the film. Hughes also signed another newcomer, Jane Russell, for the female lead, and realizing the inexperience of his two stars, also signed veteran actors Thomas Mitchell and Walter Huston. Buetel was signed to a standard seven-year contract at $150 per week and was assured by Hughes that he would become a major star. Filmed in late 1940 and early 1941, The Outlaw officially premiered in 1943 but was not widely seen until 1946. It was notable for suggesting the act of sexual intercourse, uncommon in mainstream movies of the era, and for allowing characters to "sin on film", without a suitable punishment also being depicted, in violation of the Production Code. Much of the publicity surrounding the release of the film focused on Jane Russell, and she established a solid film career, despite critics giving her performance in The Outlaw poor reviews. Buetel's performance was also highly criticised, and he languished with Hughes refusing to allow him to work. The director Howard Hawks tried to secure his services for the film Red River (1948), but after Hughes refused to allow Buetel to take part, Montgomery Clift was chosen and Clift went on to an active film career. In 1951 Buetel appeared in Best of the Badmen, his first film appearance in eleven years. Over the next few years he appeared in five more films, and made infrequent appearances on television. In 1956, he landed the role of 41-year-old Jeff Taggert in Edgar Buchanan's syndication western series, Judge Roy Bean. Others who appeared regularly in the 39-episode series, set in Langtry, Texas, were Jackie Loughery, X Brands, Tristram Coffin, Glenn Strange, and Lash La Rue. Buetel's last acting role was in a 1961 episode of Wagon Train. He also appeared as himself in the 1982 Night of 100 Stars television special. He died in Portland, Oregon, and was buried at Portland Memorial Park. The first time I saw this movie was in 1950 in a local cinema in Barcelona,(​​double session). in those days was something daring for a film the scenes between Jack Russell and Jean Beutel, although personally I was impressed mainly by the beauty of Jane Russell. I love the way the plot of the film, especially by the end of the story, unlike some other versions as to the truth of whether it was who killed Pat Garrett Billy the Kid. I prefer this ending for me was a surprise. It was a pity that Howard Hughes thus ruin the career of a good actor like Jack Beutel, but it also happened with other very good players, which ended up being ignored and forgotten. back to the movie I liked a lot. photography is excellent, the normal dialogs, the correct interpretation, since the lack of a good director and best screenplay had yielded better results. definitely a good movie.

    Stories of the old West abound and Hollywood is no stranger to putting them onto the silver screen. However, tinsel town is not very careful when it comes to historical accuracy. Take this film for instance, the original script was written by Jules Furthman, for a special project directed by none other than Howard Hughes. The movie is called " The Outlaw " and is supposedly one of a few the late Hughes touted as his best. However, playing fast and loose with history is sure to cause historians to scratch their heads. In this fanciful tale, audiences are treated to a make believe story wherein we have two western legends 'Billy the Kid' aka, William Bonny (Jack Beutel) and 'Doc Holiday' aka, John Henry Holiday (Walter Huston) arriving in Lincoln, New Mexico and becoming fast friends. Unlikely as that is, we are also treated to Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) who comes to dislike both men. Not because they are outlaws, but because they form a closer bond which many suggest boarders on the suspicious. Jane Russell is the Buxom bombshell Rio McDonald, who was the surprising sex-sensation and X-rated Eye-candy of the 1940s. The actors are likable enough and carry the fictional story along to it's rather slow, almost torturous ending. The motion picture has its ardent proponents, which equal it's cinematic detractors. However, the special reason why this film is sought after is due to its depiction of Jan Russell in a 'super' bra (Which she never wore). Indeed, I watched the movie with anticipation and realized in the year 2010 we have a whole plethora of "Full-Figure' want-to-be's who've revealed more than Russell ever did. I believe that were it not for the trashing of western myths, this movie might rank as a Classic, but as it is, many would warn its director to stick to airplanes. ****

    I don't know if Howard Hughes was gay like some commentators maintain. I do know he was bat-shiat crazy. So the constant betrayal and backstabbing and shifting alliances are easy to see coming from his frightened mind. As a technical worker Hughes was also an Asperger's sufferer, who values things more than human relationships and can't understand humans anyway. So we see a pouch of tobacco and a horse traded around as casually as they do Jane Russell. Did anyone mention Johnny Carson's introduction of her on his show? "Here they are, Jane Russell." What disturbed me was her voice over-- what do you call it-- Foley stage? She sounds like a 12-year-old. Its quite off-putting and makes the creepiness of Hollywood shine through. So the lack of human motivations and operations give this a one star. But even if Howard Hughes knew how human beings felt or operated, the musical score would get this a one-star. Good gosh, is veered between over-dramatic Hitchcock and the Three Stooges (wha whaa whaaaa). In between was what others have described as bad Tchaikovsky. As you would expect for the guy that gave us Citizen Kane, the cinematography was pretty good. I bet I would have liked this a lot better if I turned off the sound. Closed-captioning would be far preferable to the wooden delivery and bad score. Double triple spoiler-- I do love the effect when Doc shoots big chunks out of Billy's ears. We need more of this in-camera stuff, CGI is boring me to tears. Now that the film is ending, I think of that guy that said it only makes sense if Pat, Doc, and Billy are gay, and he may have a point. But let's face it, if any real 1940s homosexuals were behind this film, it would be 100 times better. Quadruple spoiler-- Its nice that Doc dies saying he don't want to die in bed, and Val Kilmer picks up the meme in Tombstone. As a movie this is execrable, but as an exploration into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic Asperger suffer, it is a real treasure. I love how Hughes makes all the elements of a Jane Russell soft-core porno, since he has so little understanding of human beings he thinks that is the only reason we would watch this. Then again, maybe he was right.

    My oh my, I've seen some butt ugly films in 67 years but I must say that this piece of junk was the worst. A two hour monstrosity that took me a half a day to plow through. I picked this film up at a thrift store for 50 cents and now I know why. I thought it would be a classic, but I should have known better when I saw Howard Hughes on the box. The dialog was idiotic at best and the story was totally absurd and boring to tears. The three male main characters came right out of a bath house for sure. Sorry I had to give this abortion a 1 as I had no choice of a zero. Thank God for Jane Russells magnificent breasts.....all was not lost.

    This movie isn't a masterpiece but its rather fun and good to watch. Love the soundtrack when Billy has facial expressions and doesn't trust anyone. Jack buetel should have had a bigger popularity....sure he wasn't perfect but he was a kid then and i thought he rendered his role quite well. Very good looking and with charisma it is a mystery to me why his career didn't flourish. Walter Houston was admirable and we could feel his emotions easily..that is the result of a great actor. Thomas Mitchell equal to himself...never does a bad performance. The story line is simple but yet we are tempted to watch the film because of its fast pacing. There are lots of flaws but i liked it anyways...only Jane Russell didn't get to me....she is bland...has no dialogue...and had the stupidest facial expressions ever. Yes a fun movie that i urge you to see with the mentally of the 1943 era.

    this movie really surprised me. nothing from this era of American movies was like this i've ever seen. you can not think of this as bad acting as some reviewers will say. you have to think of this as "true" acting: they are acting the way people act in real life. not the way we are used to seeing them on camera. this "kid" is like every hardass street punk with a horrible childhood i ever met. you can see the emotional depravity in his gaze on the other characters. his unflinching at being grazed across the hand and shot through the ears; as hard as a hardass can be. crying inside but not letting these people the satisfaction of knowing it. us just waiting for him to retaliate but him having the satisfaction of putting Doc through the heartache. the sexual tension and innuendos between jane and jack are more like modern movies than something from this era. i bet many people left disgusted and went and complained to their pastor they were "demonized" by this movie. many others probably wondered why other films didn't come so close to reality. not gay in any way. 'f' the homos just wishing it was.

    Howard Hughes directed this awful film. The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters, especially Walter Huston, just say their dialogue and that's that. Huston was terribly miscast as Doc Holliday. Thomas Mitchell has his moments, especially at the end of the film with his outburst. Even with her voluptuous bosom, Jane Russell is often churlish. The film might have been better had it went into further detail about the great friendship that Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid had. Certainly, Holliday taught The Kid humanity and probably he paid with that with his life. Trusting each other is another great theme of the film. We just can't trust the directing, speech and total boredom, especially during the first half-hour of this film. Even the Indians don't engage us.

    Contains major spoilers. People have been totally slamming this movie, and I don't feel that's completely fair, since the photography is pretty good. OK, so the acting (if you can call it that: it's more like reciting lines) is wooden. The screen-writing is hilarious, and not because this is supposed to be a comedy (or was it? I've seen this three times and I'm still not sure). Maybe it's supposed to be British humor, where all absurd situations get treated as if it were normal: Example 1: Doc's girlfriend falls in love with Billy, and Doc appears upset but doesn't display any emotion. Example 2: Doc shoots Garrett's friends, and Garrett says - with a straight face - something akin to "this isn't going to help our friendship". Oh yes - and the music is sometimes vaudevillian comedy style, usually at inappropriate times. I've usually limited my bad movie watching to science fiction or drama...and now I can add a Western to the mix. Highly recommended.

    Seems like boobs were the stars--writing and characters FAR less important. Back when "The Outlaw" was completed, the film sat on the shelf for two years because it was considered unacceptable for the public. The Production Code was pretty much ignored and theater after theater either refused to show it or the local legal authorities threatened to jail the owners of the theaters. What was so indecent about this film? Apparently Jane Russell's breasts--and the many cleavage shots you see of her. However, you never see her breasts and by today's standards, it's actually a pretty tame film. Unfortunately, all this controversy made this film famous. I say unfortunately because after finally getting around to seeing it, it's a terrible movie! It seems that although the producer, Howard Hughes, took TONS of efforts to film the breast just right, no effort was made to get a script worth filming. The dialog is terrible, the film amazingly talky (VERY VERY VERY talky) and dull and historically speaking, it's even worse than the usual western about the semi-mythical heroes of the west. Speaking of getting the history wrong, there is no concrete evidence that Billy the Kid (a rather minor outlaw, by the way) knew or met Doc Holliday. But, what we DO know is that Holliday was NOT killed by Pat Garrett like he was in this film. He died in a sanitarium in Colorado of Tuberculosis!! In fact, most of the film is just made up junk--much of which was deliberately peppered with sexual innuendo. In one scene, it appears as if Billy the Kid rapes a lady (Russell) and she later falls in love with him (a VILE clich&eacute; to say the least)!

As a technical worker Hughes was also an Asperger's sufferer, who values things more than human relationships and can't understand humans anyway. So we see a pouch of tobacco and a horse traded around as casually as they do Jane Russell. Did anyone mention Johnny Carson's introduction of her on his show? "Here they are, Jane Russell." What disturbed me was her voice over-- what do you call it-- Foley stage? She sounds like a 12-year-old. Its quite off-putting and makes the creepiness of Hollywood shine through. So the lack of human motivations and operations give this a one star. But even if Howard Hughes knew how human beings felt or operated, the musical score would get this a one-star. Good gosh, is veered between over-dramatic Hitchcock and the Three Stooges (wha whaa whaaaa). In between was what others have described as bad Tchaikovsky. As you would expect for the guy that gave us Citizen Kane, the cinematography was pretty good. I bet I would have liked this a lot better if I turned off the sound. Closed-captioning would be far preferable to the wooden delivery and bad score. Double triple spoiler-- I do love the effect when Doc shoots big chunks out of Billy's ears. We need more of this in-camera stuff, CGI is boring me to tears. Now that the film is ending, I think of that guy that said it only makes sense if Pat, Doc, and Billy are gay, and he may have a point. But let's face it, if any real 1940s homosexuals were behind this film, it would be 100 times better. Quadruple spoiler-- Its nice that Doc dies saying he don't want to die in bed, and Val Kilmer picks up the meme in Tombstone. As a movie this is execrable, but as an exploration into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic Asperger suffer, it is a real treasure. I love how Hughes makes all the elements of a Jane Russell soft-core porno, since he has so little understanding of human beings he thinks that is the only reason we would watch this. Then again, maybe he was right.

    My oh my, I've seen some butt ugly films in 67 years but I must say that this piece of junk was the worst. A two hour monstrosity that took me a half a day to plow through. I picked this film up at a thrift store for 50 cents and now I know why. I thought it would be a classic, but I should have known better when I saw Howard Hughes on the box. The dialog was idiotic at best and the story was totally absurd and boring to tears. The three male main characters came right out of a bath house for sure. Sorry I had to give this abortion a 1 as I had no choice of a zero. Thank God for Jane Russells magnificent breasts.....all was not lost.

    This movie isn't a masterpiece but its rather fun and good to watch. Love the soundtrack when Billy has facial expressions and doesn't trust anyone. Jack buetel should have had a bigger popularity....sure he wasn't perfect but he was a kid then and i thought he rendered his role quite well. Very good looking and with charisma it is a mystery to me why his career didn't flourish. Walter Houston was admirable and we could feel his emotions easily..that is the result of a great actor. Thomas Mitchell equal to himself...never does a bad performance. The story line is simple but yet we are tempted to watch the film because of its fast pacing. There are lots of flaws but i liked it anyways...only Jane Russell didn't get to me....she is bland...has no dialogue...and had the stupidest facial expressions ever. Yes a fun movie that i urge you to see with the mentally of the 1943 era.

    this movie really surprised me. nothing from this era of American movies was like this i've ever seen. you can not think of this as bad acting as some reviewers will say. you have to think of this as "true" acting: they are acting the way people act in real life. not the way we are used to seeing them on camera. this "kid" is like every hardass street punk with a horrible childhood i ever met. you can see the emotional depravity in his gaze on the other characters. his unflinching at being grazed across the hand and shot through the ears; as hard as a hardass can be. crying inside but not letting these people the satisfaction of knowing it. us just waiting for him to retaliate but him having the satisfaction of putting Doc through the heartache. the sexual tension and innuendos between jane and jack are more like modern movies than something from this era. i bet many people left disgusted and went and complained to their pastor they were "demonized" by this movie. many others probably wondered why other films didn't come so close to reality. not gay in any way. 'f' the homos just wishing it was.

    Howard Hughes directed this awful film. The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters, especially Walter Huston, just say their dialogue and that's that. Huston was terribly miscast as Doc Holliday. Thomas Mitchell has his moments, especially at the end of the film with his outburst. Even with her voluptuous bosom, Jane Russell is often churlish. The film might have been better had it went into further detail about the great friendship that Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid had. Certainly, Holliday taught The Kid humanity and probably he paid with that with his life. Trusting each other is another great theme of the film. We just can't trust the directing, speech and total boredom, especially during the first half-hour of this film. Even the Indians don't engage us.

    Contains major spoilers. People have been totally slamming this movie, and I don't feel that's completely fair, since the photography is pretty good. OK, so the acting (if you can call it that: it's more like reciting lines) is wooden. The screen-writing is hilarious, and not because this is supposed to be a comedy (or was it? I've seen this three times and I'm still not sure). Maybe it's supposed to be British humor, where all absurd situations get treated as if it were normal: Example 1: Doc's girlfriend falls in love with Billy, and Doc appears upset but doesn't display any emotion. Example 2: Doc shoots Garrett's friends, and Garrett says - with a straight face - something akin to "this isn't going to help our friendship". Oh yes - and the music is sometimes vaudevillian comedy style, usually at inappropriate times. I've usually limited my bad movie watching to science fiction or drama...and now I can add a Western to the mix. Highly recommended.

    Seems like boobs were the stars--writing and characters FAR less important. Back when "The Outlaw" was completed, the film sat on the shelf for two years because it was considered unacceptable for the public. The Production Code was pretty much ignored and theater after theater either refused to show it or the local legal authorities threatened to jail the owners of the theaters. What was so indecent about this film? Apparently Jane Russell's breasts--and the many cleavage shots you see of her. However, you never see her breasts and by today's standards, it's actually a pretty tame film. Unfortunately, all this controversy made this film famous. I say unfortunately because after finally getting around to seeing it, it's a terrible movie! It seems that although the producer, Howard Hughes, took TONS of efforts to film the breast just right, no effort was made to get a script worth filming. The dialog is terrible, the film amazingly talky (VERY VERY VERY talky) and dull and historically speaking, it's even worse than the usual western about the semi-mythical heroes of the west. Speaking of getting the history wrong, there is no concrete evidence that Billy the Kid (a rather minor outlaw, by the way) knew or met Doc Holliday. But, what we DO know is that Holliday was NOT killed by Pat Garrett like he was in this film. He died in a sanitarium in Colorado of Tuberculosis!! In fact, most of the film is just made up junk--much of which was deliberately peppered with sexual innuendo. In one scene, it appears as if Billy the Kid rapes a lady (Russell) and she later falls in love with him (a VILE clich&eacute; to say the least)! There are also scenes between them where she needs to cut off his clothes to save his life and it's STRONGLY implied she got naked with him to keep him warm! Pretty spicy stuff for 1941 (when the film was completed) but the rest of the film is so dumb and flat that the ONLY thing of interest is all the innuendo! I will point out that the acting was generally pretty bad. Walter Huston was such a good actor that in spite of everything, his scenes were decent. As for newcomers Jack Buetel and Jane Russell, they were simply awful--and the director did nothing to pull convincing performances from them. But the worst actor in this one was Thomas Mitchell, as he was a very experienced actor and STILL did a bunch of crappy scenes (especially near the end). Overall, there's NOTHING to like about this film aside from Russell's pulchritude. By the way, didn't anyone think to tell Russell that she kept BADLY mispronouncing 'Guadalupe' throughout the film--even though the lady was supposed to be her aunt? Also, if you go to New Mexico, you can visit Billy's graves. Yes, I say graveS because there's one near the roadway that is for tourists and the REAL one nearby. And yes, in real life Pat Garrett DEFINITELY killed Billy in the end--but not in this dopey film.

    When notorious outlaw Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) arrives in town, he is greeted with open arms by local sheriff and best friend Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell). It's not long before Holliday comes across Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel), who seems to be riding Holliday's horse that he had stolen from him in a previous town. Holliday however, takes a liking to the cocky Kid much to the annoyance of Garrett. When the Kid kills a man that pulls a gun on him first, Garrett shoots the Kid but Holliday escapes with him, taking him to Rio's (Jane Russell) place. Rio is Holliday's lady but as she is tending to his wounds, she finds herself unable to resist the Kid's charms. Multi-millionaire playboy and aviator Howard Hughes only made two films in his life (although he produced many more). I've not seen his first film, Hell's Angels (1930), which is a love-song to aviation, but this, an unconventional cross-genre western, shows his complete inexperience in the role of director. Apart from the blatant historical inaccuracies (which I'll forgive, given the film is clearly not striving for it), Hughes seems unable to decide what genre he wants the film to be. Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? Who knows? One thing is clear, he is fascinated by Jane Russell's ample bosom. He felt that the film was not doing her breasts justice, and so he designed an early wonderbra that accentuated them. This generated lots of controversy, and led to the film only getting a limited release as it fell foul of the censors. Clearly, Hughes knows that Jane Russell's sexual appeal is all that the film has going for it, judging by the posters. Apart from the terrible script and dodgy pacing, the acting is absolutely woeful. Jack Buetel, clearly hired for his looks alone, has less charisma about him than the horses he rides on. In fact, the horses have more facial expressions. Jane Russell, who would go on to be a massive star, demonstrates none of her acting ability and feistiness that she would become known for. In fairness, she is given nothing to do other than bend over Buetel with her cleavage visible, and pout occasionally when required. The most confusing thing about this film is how Hughes expects us to like these characters. Pat Garrett is supposed to the 'bad' guy, jealous and furious over Holliday choosing to ride off with Billy the Kid. Yet as he pursues the Kid, who is by the way, a known thief and murderer, Doc Holliday shoots and kills many of Garrett's men. But somehow we are supposed to sympathise with Holliday and forget that he is a mass- murderer. It all plays out like some weird, homoerotic love story, with Garrett playing the jealous wife to Holliday's husband who has chosen to run off with Billy the Kid's younger, more exciting toyboy. The only female character of note, Rio, acts like a lost little girl who can't exist without a man's arm to lean on. The Kid treats her like s**t, and even tries to trade her for a horse, yet she remains enamoured with him, running after him when he 'allows' her to come with him. It's just a very strange, confused film. And also a very bad one.

    Jack Buetel (September 5, 1915  June 27, 1989) was an American film and television actor. Born in Dallas, Texas, Buetel moved to Los Angeles, California in the late 1930s with the intention of establishing a film career. Unable to find such work, he was employed as an insurance clerk when he was noticed by an agent who was impressed by his looks. Introduced to Howard Hughes, who was about to begin filming The Outlaw, Buetel was signed to play the lead role as Billy the Kid, with the previously signed David Bacon being dropped from the film. Hughes also signed another newcomer, Jane Russell, for the female lead, and realizing the inexperience of his two stars, also signed veteran actors Thomas Mitchell and Walter Huston. Buetel was signed to a standard seven-year contract at $150 per week and was assured by Hughes that he would become a major star. Filmed in late 1940 and early 1941, The Outlaw officially premiered in 1943 but was not widely seen until 1946. It was notable for suggesting the act of sexual intercourse, uncommon in mainstream movies of the era, and for allowing characters to "sin on film", without a suitable punishment also being depicted, in violation of the Production Code. Much of the publicity surrounding the release of the film focused on Jane Russell, and she established a solid film career, despite critics giving her performance in The Outlaw poor reviews. Buetel's performance was also highly criticised, and he languished with Hughes refusing to allow him to work. The director Howard Hawks tried to secure his services for the film Red River (1948), but after Hughes refused to allow Buetel to take part, Montgomery Clift was chosen and Clift went on to an active film career. In 1951 Buetel appeared in Best of the Badmen, his first film appearance in eleven years. Over the next few years he appeared in five more films, and made infrequent appearances on television. In 1956, he landed the role of 41-year-old Jeff Taggert in Edgar Buchanan's syndication western series, Judge Roy Bean. Others who appeared regularly in the 39-episode series, set in Langtry, Texas, were Jackie Loughery, X Brands, Tristram Coffin, Glenn Strange, and Lash La Rue. Buetel's last acting role was in a 1961 episode of Wagon Train. He also appeared as himself in the 1982 Night of 100 Stars television special. He died in Portland, Oregon, and was buried at Portland Memorial Park. The first time I saw this movie was in 1950 in a local cinema in Barcelona,(​​double session). in those days was something daring for a film the scenes between Jack Russell and Jean Beutel, although personally I was impressed mainly by the beauty of Jane Russell. I love the way the plot of the film, especially by the end of the story, unlike some other versions as to the truth of whether it was who killed Pat Garrett Billy the Kid. I prefer this ending for me was a surprise. It was a pity that Howard Hughes thus ruin the career of a good actor like Jack Beutel, but it also happened with other very good players, which ended up being ignored and forgotten. back to the movie I liked a lot. photography is excellent, the normal dialogs, the correct interpretation, since the lack of a good director and best screenplay had yielded better results. definitely a good movie.

    Stories of the old West abound and Hollywood is no stranger to putting them onto the silver screen. However, tinsel town is not very careful when it comes to historical accuracy. Take this film for instance, the original script was written by Jules Furthman, for a special project directed by none other than Howard Hughes. The movie is called " The Outlaw " and is supposedly one of a few the late Hughes touted as his best. However, playing fast and loose with history is sure to cause historians to scratch their heads. In this fanciful tale, audiences are treated to a make believe story wherein we have two western legends 'Billy the Kid' aka, William Bonny (Jack Beutel) and 'Doc Holiday' aka, John Henry Holiday (Walter Huston) arriving in Lincoln, New Mexico and becoming fast friends. Unlikely as that is, we are also treated to Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) who comes to dislike both men. Not because they are outlaws, but because they form a closer bond which many suggest boarders on the suspicious. Jane Russell is the Buxom bombshell Rio McDonald, who was the surprising sex-sensation and X-rated Eye-candy of the 1940s. The actors are likable enough and carry the fictional story along to it's rather slow, almost torturous ending. The motion picture has its ardent proponents, which equal it's cinematic detractors. However, the special reason why this film is sought after is due to its depiction of Jan Russell in a 'super' bra (Which she never wore). Indeed, I watched the movie with anticipation and realized in the year 2010 we have a whole plethora of "Full-Figure' want-to-be's who've revealed more than Russell ever did. I believe that were it not for the trashing of western myths, this movie might rank as a Classic, but as it is, many would warn its director to stick to airplanes. ****
