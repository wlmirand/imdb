    In my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have come to number 246, which is "Before Sunrise" directed by Richard Linklater. Before I saw it I just thought it would be some dumb 90s romance flick, but my prediction was proved wrong. This movie was actually quiet enjoyable. American Jesse Wallace meets the French girl C&eacute;line on a train from Budapest. They have a great chat and come to like each other. C&eacute;line is on her way to Paris, while Jesse is going on a plane from Vienna back to the United States. When the train stops in Vienna he convinces her to spend the night with him in the city. Through the movie they have several interesting conversations about everything between heaven and earth and they are quiet interesting. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do a great job in their lead roles as Jesse and C&eacute;line. The movie is very beautiful too and does have some kind of special magic over it. I recommend it if you are in for a special treat. So overall it's a pretty good movie and I will give it 8 out of 10 stars.

    Recommended by a good friend, Before Sunrise is probably one of the most memorable romantic movies I have seen. There is nothing like it and its simplicity is, I think, what compelled people to love it. The movie, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply, is about both young American Jesse and French Celine. They met in a train bound for Vienna and talked a little about each other. Each has no idea where their simple conversation would lead. Everything that happened on that day happened naturally, all unplanned. They spent the night in Vienna, walking around the city, visiting famous landmarks and talking, revealing details about themselves like they've been friends for quite some time. It's a no brainer to figure out that there is going to be more of Jesse's introduction/pep talk to Celine on the train. And while waiting for something out of the ordinary in the plot, I find myself enjoying the mundane things the film is showing. As I've said, it's the simplicity of the movie that draws its audience to finishing it and listening intently to the lines of the characters. Three things that I like about Before Sunrise are as follows: 1. Good script. Not great but good. But that is the beauty of it, there are no filled with ripe wisdom lines that characters are throwing but the good script makes audience know who is the cynic and who is the romantic at heart but is careful at loving. The script even makes it worth waiting how the film is going to end. 2. Good theme. This one is one of the things unmasked by number 1. Jesse and Celine have fallen into minor disagreements and I find myself comfortable with it. I don't even take sides, I just let it be. I enjoy the role of an observer. Point is, the characters are two young souls who are still in the process of knowing themselves and having been through experiences that may have torn them but they talk about it comfortably. Their self-discovery is a work in progress and their self- fulfillment could be a case-to-case basis but it's there. 3. Sense of Wonder. Unlike some friends who were left hanging with the story's ending, I was basking in the sense of wonder. I actually find this part realistic. After knowing that a romance is brewing and realizing that the film's about to end, I enjoyed wondering what it is going to be for Jesse and Celine. Before Sunrise is no perfect movie but it will make you feel better about a lot of things: life, love, friends, family, and faith. If these things interest you, this one is for you. Highly recommended!

    This is about the accidental meeting of two mid-20s age college students: "Jesse" (Ethan Hawke) and "Celine" (Julie Delpy). He's returning from a disappointing visit to his girlfriend in Spain (she's in an international student program but has fallen in love with another student and dumped Jesse). He's near broke and on a train to Vienna from where he'll take his cheapest flight back to the USA. Celine's on the same train, returning to her home in Paris when they meet. Although French, she's studied in the USA and speaks excellent English. Jesse asks - and Celine agrees - to interrupt her trip to spend a few more hours together exploring Vienna before his plane leaves. Gradually, as they get to know each other, they become more deeply attached. As Roger Ebert said, "This sort of scenario has happened....millions of times. It has rarely happened in a nicer, sweeter, more gentle way.... (It's) so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera." This is the first film (so far, of 3) by Linklater starring Delpy and Hawke, each filmed 9 years apart: "Before Sunset" (2004) & "Before Midnight" (2013). While it'd be nice to see them in order, each one is so good, so unique and satisfying that it's more important to just see them. The series is about relationships: how do we get to know others and let others know us, how do we handle differences, conflicts? To what would a long term relationship with this person lead? - satisfaction? - disappointment? How much of which? How can we tell? This film's opening raises those questions by example: on the train ride, Celine's bothered by the loud conversation of a long married, middle-aged couple across the aisle from her: they argue so loudly (and obviously chronically) about? - whatever, everything - that Celine moves and finds herself across the aisle from Jesse. Their conversation starts - and where will this go? That's the gist of this marvelous, very unique movie. People who prefer car chases and explosions should avoid it--no action of that kind, whatsover; it's all just talk--but, for many of us, what exciting talk that keeps us wondering to where it will lead!!

    Jessie and Celine meet on a train in Austria. Based on short conversation, both of them take a chance and get off together in Vienna. They go on to spend one of the greatest nights of their lives, sharing an experience neither character will ever be able to forget. I love the fundamental idea of this movie. That two complete strangers can forge such a deep connection based on a such a brief interaction is very intriguing. Are there potential soul mates hidden in the world for all of us, just waiting for you to talk to them? It is a very hopeful start to Linklater's series of movies, and one that is important to reflect on as you watch the following movies. The dialogue is written fantastically with natural conversation that flows. The characters touch on universal themes that couples all through time have chatted and argued about, and you can feel their attraction building as more and more of their personalities are revealed to each other. I love Julie Delpy's French accent, too! This movie blew me away on first viewing, but it wasn't until Before Sunset that I truly fell in love with this couple. This movie features several extremely long takes, which work perfectly in creating the feeling that you are actually spending the night with Jessie and Celine in real time. I would recommend seeing both movies before you judge this as another fluffy love story. Re-watching this after seeing the second movie made me like it even more, and I would honestly rate this above nearly every other romance movie I have seen for its completely genuine feeling.

    Lucky me. A couple of months ago, I got to experience the entire BEFORE trilogy and not have to wait 18 years to reach the (possible) end. When Before Midnight was released in summer 2013, I had a full day of BEFORE movies and was pleasantly pleased. The first, Before Sunrise, is the only one I'd seen before. A long, long time ago. I really did like it back then, and with this second viewing, I still admired it and loved how it holds up today, 18-years-later. I absolutely loved the dialogue, the originality and especially the camera following these two strangers who were destined to be with each other. The movie starts with the unlikely pairing of an American on holiday in Europe who meets his instant attraction, a French student. Both are on a train, but with different stops and yet, he convinces her to debark with him in Vienna. For one solid day/evening/morning, they literally walk and talk and get to know each other. Of course, they fall in love  so much so, that the "lust" they thought they knew was relevant at first, wasn't that at all. These two were meant to be together. It takes balls for Director and Writer Richard Linklater to pull off a 105 minute movie based solely on walking and talking and only truly starring two unknowns, buthe pulled it off. The dialogue was crisp, the connection and charisma was present and the originality of such a basic, yet deep, film was refreshing. People in real life only dream about this kind of chance encounter. This may be fantasy, but it's one that many, including myself, would yearn our whole lives for. If you don't get the sense of true love, true connection and true meaning upon the finale of this film, you might want to restart the film. I did laugh, I did admire and I did fall in love with these two. I even loved the ambiguous climax. This was a love story that you'd love to read in a great novel and cherish every moment. Finally, I loved the simplicity of this film. Kudos to Linklater for such a great experiment that worked. If there were no sequels, which are certainly very good on their own, I would be okay with how this movie can stand alone.

    I have been aware of this film for quite some time having never seen it. Perhaps this is for the best for I was too young to understand the raw substance this film contained. Synopsis: Before Sunrise brings to life an experience between two human beings who find themselves connected to one another. With only a single day to themselves before heading back to their "lives" these two creatures engage in a dialogue about love, death, and life while enjoying the scenes of Vienna, Austria. Review: For a film that is virtually all dialogue, Before Sunrise holds up remarkably well. It's a great capture of human interaction contrasting other well-made dialogue films like: Glengarry Glen Ross and 12 Angry Men. The day that transpires between these two is entertaining, funny, and inspires one's own thoughts into the topics discussed between Celine and Jesse. It is not the typical love story. It's a love story where two people discuss their views on love and whether or not love itself even exists. A scene following the characters departing from a train to spend the day together reveals honest direction of dialogue between Jesse and Celine. While they had just met only a few hours before, they both confess to their feelings of awkwardness after their spontaneous decision to get to know each other. Honesty captured in this way is very nice to see. Instead of trying to correct this awkwardness, they acknowledge it and decide to take the moment wherever it leads. Astounding! What follows are healthy discussions and honest debates about the topics they address all while being vulnerable and having nothing to lose, except for their short time together.

    This is a start of a realistic connecting romance movie from a trilogy. Now I saw "Before Sunset" before seeing this one. But wished I have saw this first, since it's the first movie in this "Before" trilogy. The story is about two people meeting and as they converse, they start to build a bond with each other. While also sightseeing and experience their time in Vienna for a evening. Again the conversations hit the mark, although this time it goes in a basic root direction. It's still interesting and intriguing, even if your one of those audiences that actually thought about some of the topics in the conversation. I am not quite sure how much is ad-lib or improvised but the direction is believable and realistic. Maybe it's because both the actor and actress put few of their own real life in put, such as how Ethan Hawke is really born and raised in Texas. The conversations is basically pseudo-intellectual and philosophical view points and questions. The chemistry and connection between the two lead characters is strong. This time Ethan Hawke's character Jesse is the pessimist and slightly not as likable. While the lead actress is a optimist and likable for this first installment. The dialogues or conversations touches upon life, death, religions, relationships, and love. So although it touches on the basics, it's still a immersive film. And I enjoyed it, maybe for it's realism and thought provoking effects. Even if some areas I could agree with while others not so much. 7.8/10

    18 years... 18 years after this film released I've finally pulled the trigger to film it. I've seem copious films decades earlier than this and obviously younger than this. But alas, a highly-acclaimed film has to be seen sometime. It's not a mind-blowing film, yet in a degree the best world I can describe this is; heartwarming, comforting... and very safe. The dialogues & humanity in this film explicitly showing the humane emotions & ambiguity among people. Yet the writer/director showed it in such a way that it is never provocative, edgy or pretentious. It is just good-old human emotion manifested in dialogues between 2 estranged lovebirds. It's never boring despite the continuous dialogues. This is a possibly a sign of human's penchant to voyeurism & gossiping, but that's a bit too much for this.

    Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love. Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures. But it still never feels like this is a clich&eacute; or tries to get some cheap shots in to make you laugh. This feels genuine and as viewers we can and should appreciate that. So while this is not necessary watching, you should take a look at this before ... watching the sequels!

    Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy by Richard Linklater, is a very powerful, thought-provoking film that I never thought would be good. This film has no action and is merely conversation, so how can this movie be so good? Well, this movie is about as close to reality as you can get. What happens in this movie could happen to anybody out there. Secondly, the script is tight and well-written. I really loved all these meaningful, philosophical conversations. I'm usually bored at mostly talk films, but the way I was grabbed into these conversations really means the movie worked. Linklater's film is about a French girl on her way back to school and an American guy heading to Vienna to take a flight home and how they started a connection with each other when they met on the train. The acting is about as good as you can get. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry and the way they delivered the dialog is just special. There is no need for supporting characters because the focus is on these two characters and their meanings of life. Overall, this is a very special, powerful film. I honestly didn't want to see this movie since I thought it would be a stupid romantic comedy, but it is really not. It's a drama that's thoughtful, funny, poignant, and just very sweet. I honestly don't get this "R" rating because the dialog would be very meaningful for teens. For those who love cinema, this is a great movie to watch. I rate this film 9/10.

The day that transpires between these two is entertaining, funny, and inspires one's own thoughts into the topics discussed between Celine and Jesse. It is not the typical love story. It's a love story where two people discuss their views on love and whether or not love itself even exists. A scene following the characters departing from a train to spend the day together reveals honest direction of dialogue between Jesse and Celine. While they had just met only a few hours before, they both confess to their feelings of awkwardness after their spontaneous decision to get to know each other. Honesty captured in this way is very nice to see. Instead of trying to correct this awkwardness, they acknowledge it and decide to take the moment wherever it leads. Astounding! What follows are healthy discussions and honest debates about the topics they address all while being vulnerable and having nothing to lose, except for their short time together.

    This is a start of a realistic connecting romance movie from a trilogy. Now I saw "Before Sunset" before seeing this one. But wished I have saw this first, since it's the first movie in this "Before" trilogy. The story is about two people meeting and as they converse, they start to build a bond with each other. While also sightseeing and experience their time in Vienna for a evening. Again the conversations hit the mark, although this time it goes in a basic root direction. It's still interesting and intriguing, even if your one of those audiences that actually thought about some of the topics in the conversation. I am not quite sure how much is ad-lib or improvised but the direction is believable and realistic. Maybe it's because both the actor and actress put few of their own real life in put, such as how Ethan Hawke is really born and raised in Texas. The conversations is basically pseudo-intellectual and philosophical view points and questions. The chemistry and connection between the two lead characters is strong. This time Ethan Hawke's character Jesse is the pessimist and slightly not as likable. While the lead actress is a optimist and likable for this first installment. The dialogues or conversations touches upon life, death, religions, relationships, and love. So although it touches on the basics, it's still a immersive film. And I enjoyed it, maybe for it's realism and thought provoking effects. Even if some areas I could agree with while others not so much. 7.8/10

    18 years... 18 years after this film released I've finally pulled the trigger to film it. I've seem copious films decades earlier than this and obviously younger than this. But alas, a highly-acclaimed film has to be seen sometime. It's not a mind-blowing film, yet in a degree the best world I can describe this is; heartwarming, comforting... and very safe. The dialogues & humanity in this film explicitly showing the humane emotions & ambiguity among people. Yet the writer/director showed it in such a way that it is never provocative, edgy or pretentious. It is just good-old human emotion manifested in dialogues between 2 estranged lovebirds. It's never boring despite the continuous dialogues. This is a possibly a sign of human's penchant to voyeurism & gossiping, but that's a bit too much for this.

    Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love. Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures. But it still never feels like this is a clich&eacute; or tries to get some cheap shots in to make you laugh. This feels genuine and as viewers we can and should appreciate that. So while this is not necessary watching, you should take a look at this before ... watching the sequels!

    Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy by Richard Linklater, is a very powerful, thought-provoking film that I never thought would be good. This film has no action and is merely conversation, so how can this movie be so good? Well, this movie is about as close to reality as you can get. What happens in this movie could happen to anybody out there. Secondly, the script is tight and well-written. I really loved all these meaningful, philosophical conversations. I'm usually bored at mostly talk films, but the way I was grabbed into these conversations really means the movie worked. Linklater's film is about a French girl on her way back to school and an American guy heading to Vienna to take a flight home and how they started a connection with each other when they met on the train. The acting is about as good as you can get. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry and the way they delivered the dialog is just special. There is no need for supporting characters because the focus is on these two characters and their meanings of life. Overall, this is a very special, powerful film. I honestly didn't want to see this movie since I thought it would be a stupid romantic comedy, but it is really not. It's a drama that's thoughtful, funny, poignant, and just very sweet. I honestly don't get this "R" rating because the dialog would be very meaningful for teens. For those who love cinema, this is a great movie to watch. I rate this film 9/10.

    In my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have come to number 246, which is "Before Sunrise" directed by Richard Linklater. Before I saw it I just thought it would be some dumb 90s romance flick, but my prediction was proved wrong. This movie was actually quiet enjoyable. American Jesse Wallace meets the French girl C&eacute;line on a train from Budapest. They have a great chat and come to like each other. C&eacute;line is on her way to Paris, while Jesse is going on a plane from Vienna back to the United States. When the train stops in Vienna he convinces her to spend the night with him in the city. Through the movie they have several interesting conversations about everything between heaven and earth and they are quiet interesting. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do a great job in their lead roles as Jesse and C&eacute;line. The movie is very beautiful too and does have some kind of special magic over it. I recommend it if you are in for a special treat. So overall it's a pretty good movie and I will give it 8 out of 10 stars.

    Recommended by a good friend, Before Sunrise is probably one of the most memorable romantic movies I have seen. There is nothing like it and its simplicity is, I think, what compelled people to love it. The movie, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply, is about both young American Jesse and French Celine. They met in a train bound for Vienna and talked a little about each other. Each has no idea where their simple conversation would lead. Everything that happened on that day happened naturally, all unplanned. They spent the night in Vienna, walking around the city, visiting famous landmarks and talking, revealing details about themselves like they've been friends for quite some time. It's a no brainer to figure out that there is going to be more of Jesse's introduction/pep talk to Celine on the train. And while waiting for something out of the ordinary in the plot, I find myself enjoying the mundane things the film is showing. As I've said, it's the simplicity of the movie that draws its audience to finishing it and listening intently to the lines of the characters. Three things that I like about Before Sunrise are as follows: 1. Good script. Not great but good. But that is the beauty of it, there are no filled with ripe wisdom lines that characters are throwing but the good script makes audience know who is the cynic and who is the romantic at heart but is careful at loving. The script even makes it worth waiting how the film is going to end. 2. Good theme. This one is one of the things unmasked by number 1. Jesse and Celine have fallen into minor disagreements and I find myself comfortable with it. I don't even take sides, I just let it be. I enjoy the role of an observer. Point is, the characters are two young souls who are still in the process of knowing themselves and having been through experiences that may have torn them but they talk about it comfortably. Their self-discovery is a work in progress and their self- fulfillment could be a case-to-case basis but it's there. 3. Sense of Wonder. Unlike some friends who were left hanging with the story's ending, I was basking in the sense of wonder. I actually find this part realistic. After knowing that a romance is brewing and realizing that the film's about to end, I enjoyed wondering what it is going to be for Jesse and Celine. Before Sunrise is no perfect movie but it will make you feel better about a lot of things: life, love, friends, family, and faith. If these things interest you, this one is for you. Highly recommended!

    This is about the accidental meeting of two mid-20s age college students: "Jesse" (Ethan Hawke) and "Celine" (Julie Delpy). He's returning from a disappointing visit to his girlfriend in Spain (she's in an international student program but has fallen in love with another student and dumped Jesse). He's near broke and on a train to Vienna from where he'll take his cheapest flight back to the USA. Celine's on the same train, returning to her home in Paris when they meet. Although French, she's studied in the USA and speaks excellent English. Jesse asks - and Celine agrees - to interrupt her trip to spend a few more hours together exploring Vienna before his plane leaves. Gradually, as they get to know each other, they become more deeply attached. As Roger Ebert said, "This sort of scenario has happened....millions of times. It has rarely happened in a nicer, sweeter, more gentle way.... (It's) so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera." This is the first film (so far, of 3) by Linklater starring Delpy and Hawke, each filmed 9 years apart: "Before Sunset" (2004) & "Before Midnight" (2013). While it'd be nice to see them in order, each one is so good, so unique and satisfying that it's more important to just see them. The series is about relationships: how do we get to know others and let others know us, how do we handle differences, conflicts? To what would a long term relationship with this person lead? - satisfaction? - disappointment? How much of which? How can we tell? This film's opening raises those questions by example: on the train ride, Celine's bothered by the loud conversation of a long married, middle-aged couple across the aisle from her: they argue so loudly (and obviously chronically) about? - whatever, everything - that Celine moves and finds herself across the aisle from Jesse. Their conversation starts - and where will this go? That's the gist of this marvelous, very unique movie. People who prefer car chases and explosions should avoid it--no action of that kind, whatsover; it's all just talk--but, for many of us, what exciting talk that keeps us wondering to where it will lead!!

    Jessie and Celine meet on a train in Austria. Based on short conversation, both of them take a chance and get off together in Vienna. They go on to spend one of the greatest nights of their lives, sharing an experience neither character will ever be able to forget. I love the fundamental idea of this movie. That two complete strangers can forge such a deep connection based on a such a brief interaction is very intriguing. Are there potential soul mates hidden in the world for all of us, just waiting for you to talk to them? It is a very hopeful start to Linklater's series of movies, and one that is important to reflect on as you watch the following movies. The dialogue is written fantastically with natural conversation that flows. The characters touch on universal themes that couples all through time have chatted and argued about, and you can feel their attraction building as more and more of their personalities are revealed to each other. I love Julie Delpy's French accent, too! This movie blew me away on first viewing, but it wasn't until Before Sunset that I truly fell in love with this couple. This movie features several extremely long takes, which work perfectly in creating the feeling that you are actually spending the night with Jessie and Celine in real time. I would recommend seeing both movies before you judge this as another fluffy love story. Re-watching this after seeing the second movie made me like it even more, and I would honestly rate this above nearly every other romance movie I have seen for its completely genuine feeling.

    Lucky me. A couple of months ago, I got to experience the entire BEFORE trilogy and not have to wait 18 years to reach the (possible) end. When Before Midnight was released in summer 2013, I had a full day of BEFORE movies and was pleasantly pleased. The first, Before Sunrise, is the only one I'd seen before. A long, long time ago. I really did like it back then, and with this second viewing, I still admired it and loved how it holds up today, 18-years-later. I absolutely loved the dialogue, the originality and especially the camera following these two strangers who were destined to be with each other. The movie starts with the unlikely pairing of an American on holiday in Europe who meets his instant attraction, a French student. Both are on a train, but with different stops and yet, he convinces her to debark with him in Vienna. For one solid day/evening/morning, they literally walk and talk and get to know each other. Of course, they fall in love  so much so, that the "lust" they thought they knew was relevant at first, wasn't that at all. These two were meant to be together. It takes balls for Director and Writer Richard Linklater to pull off a 105 minute movie based solely on walking and talking and only truly starring two unknowns, buthe pulled it off. The dialogue was crisp, the connection and charisma was present and the originality of such a basic, yet deep, film was refreshing. People in real life only dream about this kind of chance encounter. This may be fantasy, but it's one that many, including myself, would yearn our whole lives for. If you don't get the sense of true love, true connection and true meaning upon the finale of this film, you might want to restart the film. I did laugh, I did admire and I did fall in love with these two. I even loved the ambiguous climax. This was a love story that you'd love to read in a great novel and cherish every moment. Finally, I loved the simplicity of this film. Kudos to Linklater for such a great experiment that worked. If there were no sequels, which are certainly very good on their own, I would be okay with how this movie can stand alone.

    I have been aware of this film for quite some time having never seen it. Perhaps this is for the best for I was too young to understand the raw substance this film contained. Synopsis: Before Sunrise brings to life an experience between two human beings who find themselves connected to one another. With only a single day to themselves before heading back to their "lives" these two creatures engage in a dialogue about love, death, and life while enjoying the scenes of Vienna, Austria. Review: For a film that is virtually all dialogue, Before Sunrise holds up remarkably well. It's a great capture of human interaction contrasting other well-made dialogue films like: Glengarry Glen Ross and 12 Angry Men. The day that transpires between these two is entertaining, funny, and inspires one's own thoughts into the topics discussed between Celine and Jesse. It is not the typical love story. It's a love story where two people discuss their views on love and whether or not love itself even exists. A scene following the characters departing from a train to spend the day together reveals honest direction of dialogue between Jesse and Celine. While they had just met only a few hours before, they both confess to their feelings of awkwardness after their spontaneous decision to get to know each other. Honesty captured in this way is very nice to see. Instead of trying to correct this awkwardness, they acknowledge it and decide to take the moment wherever it leads. Astounding! What follows are healthy discussions and honest debates about the topics they address all while being vulnerable and having nothing to lose, except for their short time together.

Are there potential soul mates hidden in the world for all of us, just waiting for you to talk to them? It is a very hopeful start to Linklater's series of movies, and one that is important to reflect on as you watch the following movies. The dialogue is written fantastically with natural conversation that flows. The characters touch on universal themes that couples all through time have chatted and argued about, and you can feel their attraction building as more and more of their personalities are revealed to each other. I love Julie Delpy's French accent, too! This movie blew me away on first viewing, but it wasn't until Before Sunset that I truly fell in love with this couple. This movie features several extremely long takes, which work perfectly in creating the feeling that you are actually spending the night with Jessie and Celine in real time. I would recommend seeing both movies before you judge this as another fluffy love story. Re-watching this after seeing the second movie made me like it even more, and I would honestly rate this above nearly every other romance movie I have seen for its completely genuine feeling.

    Lucky me. A couple of months ago, I got to experience the entire BEFORE trilogy and not have to wait 18 years to reach the (possible) end. When Before Midnight was released in summer 2013, I had a full day of BEFORE movies and was pleasantly pleased. The first, Before Sunrise, is the only one I'd seen before. A long, long time ago. I really did like it back then, and with this second viewing, I still admired it and loved how it holds up today, 18-years-later. I absolutely loved the dialogue, the originality and especially the camera following these two strangers who were destined to be with each other. The movie starts with the unlikely pairing of an American on holiday in Europe who meets his instant attraction, a French student. Both are on a train, but with different stops and yet, he convinces her to debark with him in Vienna. For one solid day/evening/morning, they literally walk and talk and get to know each other. Of course, they fall in love  so much so, that the "lust" they thought they knew was relevant at first, wasn't that at all. These two were meant to be together. It takes balls for Director and Writer Richard Linklater to pull off a 105 minute movie based solely on walking and talking and only truly starring two unknowns, buthe pulled it off. The dialogue was crisp, the connection and charisma was present and the originality of such a basic, yet deep, film was refreshing. People in real life only dream about this kind of chance encounter. This may be fantasy, but it's one that many, including myself, would yearn our whole lives for. If you don't get the sense of true love, true connection and true meaning upon the finale of this film, you might want to restart the film. I did laugh, I did admire and I did fall in love with these two. I even loved the ambiguous climax. This was a love story that you'd love to read in a great novel and cherish every moment. Finally, I loved the simplicity of this film. Kudos to Linklater for such a great experiment that worked. If there were no sequels, which are certainly very good on their own, I would be okay with how this movie can stand alone.

    I have been aware of this film for quite some time having never seen it. Perhaps this is for the best for I was too young to understand the raw substance this film contained. Synopsis: Before Sunrise brings to life an experience between two human beings who find themselves connected to one another. With only a single day to themselves before heading back to their "lives" these two creatures engage in a dialogue about love, death, and life while enjoying the scenes of Vienna, Austria. Review: For a film that is virtually all dialogue, Before Sunrise holds up remarkably well. It's a great capture of human interaction contrasting other well-made dialogue films like: Glengarry Glen Ross and 12 Angry Men. The day that transpires between these two is entertaining, funny, and inspires one's own thoughts into the topics discussed between Celine and Jesse. It is not the typical love story. It's a love story where two people discuss their views on love and whether or not love itself even exists. A scene following the characters departing from a train to spend the day together reveals honest direction of dialogue between Jesse and Celine. While they had just met only a few hours before, they both confess to their feelings of awkwardness after their spontaneous decision to get to know each other. Honesty captured in this way is very nice to see. Instead of trying to correct this awkwardness, they acknowledge it and decide to take the moment wherever it leads. Astounding! What follows are healthy discussions and honest debates about the topics they address all while being vulnerable and having nothing to lose, except for their short time together.

    This is a start of a realistic connecting romance movie from a trilogy. Now I saw "Before Sunset" before seeing this one. But wished I have saw this first, since it's the first movie in this "Before" trilogy. The story is about two people meeting and as they converse, they start to build a bond with each other. While also sightseeing and experience their time in Vienna for a evening. Again the conversations hit the mark, although this time it goes in a basic root direction. It's still interesting and intriguing, even if your one of those audiences that actually thought about some of the topics in the conversation. I am not quite sure how much is ad-lib or improvised but the direction is believable and realistic. Maybe it's because both the actor and actress put few of their own real life in put, such as how Ethan Hawke is really born and raised in Texas. The conversations is basically pseudo-intellectual and philosophical view points and questions. The chemistry and connection between the two lead characters is strong. This time Ethan Hawke's character Jesse is the pessimist and slightly not as likable. While the lead actress is a optimist and likable for this first installment. The dialogues or conversations touches upon life, death, religions, relationships, and love. So although it touches on the basics, it's still a immersive film. And I enjoyed it, maybe for it's realism and thought provoking effects. Even if some areas I could agree with while others not so much. 7.8/10

    18 years... 18 years after this film released I've finally pulled the trigger to film it. I've seem copious films decades earlier than this and obviously younger than this. But alas, a highly-acclaimed film has to be seen sometime. It's not a mind-blowing film, yet in a degree the best world I can describe this is; heartwarming, comforting... and very safe. The dialogues & humanity in this film explicitly showing the humane emotions & ambiguity among people. Yet the writer/director showed it in such a way that it is never provocative, edgy or pretentious. It is just good-old human emotion manifested in dialogues between 2 estranged lovebirds. It's never boring despite the continuous dialogues. This is a possibly a sign of human's penchant to voyeurism & gossiping, but that's a bit too much for this.

    Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love. Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures. But it still never feels like this is a clich&eacute; or tries to get some cheap shots in to make you laugh. This feels genuine and as viewers we can and should appreciate that. So while this is not necessary watching, you should take a look at this before ... watching the sequels!

    Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy by Richard Linklater, is a very powerful, thought-provoking film that I never thought would be good. This film has no action and is merely conversation, so how can this movie be so good? Well, this movie is about as close to reality as you can get. What happens in this movie could happen to anybody out there. Secondly, the script is tight and well-written. I really loved all these meaningful, philosophical conversations. I'm usually bored at mostly talk films, but the way I was grabbed into these conversations really means the movie worked. Linklater's film is about a French girl on her way back to school and an American guy heading to Vienna to take a flight home and how they started a connection with each other when they met on the train. The acting is about as good as you can get. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry and the way they delivered the dialog is just special. There is no need for supporting characters because the focus is on these two characters and their meanings of life. Overall, this is a very special, powerful film. I honestly didn't want to see this movie since I thought it would be a stupid romantic comedy, but it is really not. It's a drama that's thoughtful, funny, poignant, and just very sweet. I honestly don't get this "R" rating because the dialog would be very meaningful for teens. For those who love cinema, this is a great movie to watch. I rate this film 9/10.

    In my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have come to number 246, which is "Before Sunrise" directed by Richard Linklater. Before I saw it I just thought it would be some dumb 90s romance flick, but my prediction was proved wrong. This movie was actually quiet enjoyable. American Jesse Wallace meets the French girl C&eacute;line on a train from Budapest. They have a great chat and come to like each other. C&eacute;line is on her way to Paris, while Jesse is going on a plane from Vienna back to the United States. When the train stops in Vienna he convinces her to spend the night with him in the city. Through the movie they have several interesting conversations about everything between heaven and earth and they are quiet interesting. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do a great job in their lead roles as Jesse and C&eacute;line. The movie is very beautiful too and does have some kind of special magic over it. I recommend it if you are in for a special treat. So overall it's a pretty good movie and I will give it 8 out of 10 stars.

    Recommended by a good friend, Before Sunrise is probably one of the most memorable romantic movies I have seen. There is nothing like it and its simplicity is, I think, what compelled people to love it. The movie, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply, is about both young American Jesse and French Celine. They met in a train bound for Vienna and talked a little about each other. Each has no idea where their simple conversation would lead. Everything that happened on that day happened naturally, all unplanned. They spent the night in Vienna, walking around the city, visiting famous landmarks and talking, revealing details about themselves like they've been friends for quite some time. It's a no brainer to figure out that there is going to be more of Jesse's introduction/pep talk to Celine on the train. And while waiting for something out of the ordinary in the plot, I find myself enjoying the mundane things the film is showing. As I've said, it's the simplicity of the movie that draws its audience to finishing it and listening intently to the lines of the characters. Three things that I like about Before Sunrise are as follows: 1. Good script. Not great but good. But that is the beauty of it, there are no filled with ripe wisdom lines that characters are throwing but the good script makes audience know who is the cynic and who is the romantic at heart but is careful at loving. The script even makes it worth waiting how the film is going to end. 2. Good theme. This one is one of the things unmasked by number 1. Jesse and Celine have fallen into minor disagreements and I find myself comfortable with it. I don't even take sides, I just let it be. I enjoy the role of an observer. Point is, the characters are two young souls who are still in the process of knowing themselves and having been through experiences that may have torn them but they talk about it comfortably. Their self-discovery is a work in progress and their self- fulfillment could be a case-to-case basis but it's there. 3. Sense of Wonder. Unlike some friends who were left hanging with the story's ending, I was basking in the sense of wonder. I actually find this part realistic. After knowing that a romance is brewing and realizing that the film's about to end, I enjoyed wondering what it is going to be for Jesse and Celine. Before Sunrise is no perfect movie but it will make you feel better about a lot of things: life, love, friends, family, and faith. If these things interest you, this one is for you. Highly recommended!

    This is about the accidental meeting of two mid-20s age college students: "Jesse" (Ethan Hawke) and "Celine" (Julie Delpy). He's returning from a disappointing visit to his girlfriend in Spain (she's in an international student program but has fallen in love with another student and dumped Jesse). He's near broke and on a train to Vienna from where he'll take his cheapest flight back to the USA. Celine's on the same train, returning to her home in Paris when they meet. Although French, she's studied in the USA and speaks excellent English. Jesse asks - and Celine agrees - to interrupt her trip to spend a few more hours together exploring Vienna before his plane leaves. Gradually, as they get to know each other, they become more deeply attached. As Roger Ebert said, "This sort of scenario has happened....millions of times. It has rarely happened in a nicer, sweeter, more gentle way.... (It's) so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera." This is the first film (so far, of 3) by Linklater starring Delpy and Hawke, each filmed 9 years apart: "Before Sunset" (2004) & "Before Midnight" (2013). While it'd be nice to see them in order, each one is so good, so unique and satisfying that it's more important to just see them. The series is about relationships: how do we get to know others and let others know us, how do we handle differences, conflicts? To what would a long term relationship with this person lead? - satisfaction? - disappointment? How much of which? How can we tell? This film's opening raises those questions by example: on the train ride, Celine's bothered by the loud conversation of a long married, middle-aged couple across the aisle from her: they argue so loudly (and obviously chronically) about? - whatever, everything - that Celine moves and finds herself across the aisle from Jesse. Their conversation starts - and where will this go? That's the gist of this marvelous, very unique movie. People who prefer car chases and explosions should avoid it--no action of that kind, whatsover; it's all just talk--but, for many of us, what exciting talk that keeps us wondering to where it will lead!!

    Jessie and Celine meet on a train in Austria. Based on short conversation, both of them take a chance and get off together in Vienna. They go on to spend one of the greatest nights of their lives, sharing an experience neither character will ever be able to forget. I love the fundamental idea of this movie. That two complete strangers can forge such a deep connection based on a such a brief interaction is very intriguing. Are there potential soul mates hidden in the world for all of us, just waiting for you to talk to them? It is a very hopeful start to Linklater's series of movies, and one that is important to reflect on as you watch the following movies.

But that is the beauty of it, there are no filled with ripe wisdom lines that characters are throwing but the good script makes audience know who is the cynic and who is the romantic at heart but is careful at loving. The script even makes it worth waiting how the film is going to end. 2. Good theme. This one is one of the things unmasked by number 1. Jesse and Celine have fallen into minor disagreements and I find myself comfortable with it. I don't even take sides, I just let it be. I enjoy the role of an observer. Point is, the characters are two young souls who are still in the process of knowing themselves and having been through experiences that may have torn them but they talk about it comfortably. Their self-discovery is a work in progress and their self- fulfillment could be a case-to-case basis but it's there. 3. Sense of Wonder. Unlike some friends who were left hanging with the story's ending, I was basking in the sense of wonder. I actually find this part realistic. After knowing that a romance is brewing and realizing that the film's about to end, I enjoyed wondering what it is going to be for Jesse and Celine. Before Sunrise is no perfect movie but it will make you feel better about a lot of things: life, love, friends, family, and faith. If these things interest you, this one is for you. Highly recommended!

    This is about the accidental meeting of two mid-20s age college students: "Jesse" (Ethan Hawke) and "Celine" (Julie Delpy). He's returning from a disappointing visit to his girlfriend in Spain (she's in an international student program but has fallen in love with another student and dumped Jesse). He's near broke and on a train to Vienna from where he'll take his cheapest flight back to the USA. Celine's on the same train, returning to her home in Paris when they meet. Although French, she's studied in the USA and speaks excellent English. Jesse asks - and Celine agrees - to interrupt her trip to spend a few more hours together exploring Vienna before his plane leaves. Gradually, as they get to know each other, they become more deeply attached. As Roger Ebert said, "This sort of scenario has happened....millions of times. It has rarely happened in a nicer, sweeter, more gentle way.... (It's) so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera." This is the first film (so far, of 3) by Linklater starring Delpy and Hawke, each filmed 9 years apart: "Before Sunset" (2004) & "Before Midnight" (2013). While it'd be nice to see them in order, each one is so good, so unique and satisfying that it's more important to just see them. The series is about relationships: how do we get to know others and let others know us, how do we handle differences, conflicts? To what would a long term relationship with this person lead? - satisfaction? - disappointment? How much of which? How can we tell? This film's opening raises those questions by example: on the train ride, Celine's bothered by the loud conversation of a long married, middle-aged couple across the aisle from her: they argue so loudly (and obviously chronically) about? - whatever, everything - that Celine moves and finds herself across the aisle from Jesse. Their conversation starts - and where will this go? That's the gist of this marvelous, very unique movie. People who prefer car chases and explosions should avoid it--no action of that kind, whatsover; it's all just talk--but, for many of us, what exciting talk that keeps us wondering to where it will lead!!

    Jessie and Celine meet on a train in Austria. Based on short conversation, both of them take a chance and get off together in Vienna. They go on to spend one of the greatest nights of their lives, sharing an experience neither character will ever be able to forget. I love the fundamental idea of this movie. That two complete strangers can forge such a deep connection based on a such a brief interaction is very intriguing. Are there potential soul mates hidden in the world for all of us, just waiting for you to talk to them? It is a very hopeful start to Linklater's series of movies, and one that is important to reflect on as you watch the following movies. The dialogue is written fantastically with natural conversation that flows. The characters touch on universal themes that couples all through time have chatted and argued about, and you can feel their attraction building as more and more of their personalities are revealed to each other. I love Julie Delpy's French accent, too! This movie blew me away on first viewing, but it wasn't until Before Sunset that I truly fell in love with this couple. This movie features several extremely long takes, which work perfectly in creating the feeling that you are actually spending the night with Jessie and Celine in real time. I would recommend seeing both movies before you judge this as another fluffy love story. Re-watching this after seeing the second movie made me like it even more, and I would honestly rate this above nearly every other romance movie I have seen for its completely genuine feeling.

    Lucky me. A couple of months ago, I got to experience the entire BEFORE trilogy and not have to wait 18 years to reach the (possible) end. When Before Midnight was released in summer 2013, I had a full day of BEFORE movies and was pleasantly pleased. The first, Before Sunrise, is the only one I'd seen before. A long, long time ago. I really did like it back then, and with this second viewing, I still admired it and loved how it holds up today, 18-years-later. I absolutely loved the dialogue, the originality and especially the camera following these two strangers who were destined to be with each other. The movie starts with the unlikely pairing of an American on holiday in Europe who meets his instant attraction, a French student. Both are on a train, but with different stops and yet, he convinces her to debark with him in Vienna. For one solid day/evening/morning, they literally walk and talk and get to know each other. Of course, they fall in love  so much so, that the "lust" they thought they knew was relevant at first, wasn't that at all. These two were meant to be together. It takes balls for Director and Writer Richard Linklater to pull off a 105 minute movie based solely on walking and talking and only truly starring two unknowns, buthe pulled it off. The dialogue was crisp, the connection and charisma was present and the originality of such a basic, yet deep, film was refreshing. People in real life only dream about this kind of chance encounter. This may be fantasy, but it's one that many, including myself, would yearn our whole lives for. If you don't get the sense of true love, true connection and true meaning upon the finale of this film, you might want to restart the film. I did laugh, I did admire and I did fall in love with these two. I even loved the ambiguous climax. This was a love story that you'd love to read in a great novel and cherish every moment. Finally, I loved the simplicity of this film. Kudos to Linklater for such a great experiment that worked. If there were no sequels, which are certainly very good on their own, I would be okay with how this movie can stand alone.

    I have been aware of this film for quite some time having never seen it. Perhaps this is for the best for I was too young to understand the raw substance this film contained. Synopsis: Before Sunrise brings to life an experience between two human beings who find themselves connected to one another. With only a single day to themselves before heading back to their "lives" these two creatures engage in a dialogue about love, death, and life while enjoying the scenes of Vienna, Austria. Review: For a film that is virtually all dialogue, Before Sunrise holds up remarkably well. It's a great capture of human interaction contrasting other well-made dialogue films like: Glengarry Glen Ross and 12 Angry Men. The day that transpires between these two is entertaining, funny, and inspires one's own thoughts into the topics discussed between Celine and Jesse. It is not the typical love story. It's a love story where two people discuss their views on love and whether or not love itself even exists. A scene following the characters departing from a train to spend the day together reveals honest direction of dialogue between Jesse and Celine. While they had just met only a few hours before, they both confess to their feelings of awkwardness after their spontaneous decision to get to know each other. Honesty captured in this way is very nice to see. Instead of trying to correct this awkwardness, they acknowledge it and decide to take the moment wherever it leads. Astounding! What follows are healthy discussions and honest debates about the topics they address all while being vulnerable and having nothing to lose, except for their short time together.

    This is a start of a realistic connecting romance movie from a trilogy. Now I saw "Before Sunset" before seeing this one. But wished I have saw this first, since it's the first movie in this "Before" trilogy. The story is about two people meeting and as they converse, they start to build a bond with each other. While also sightseeing and experience their time in Vienna for a evening. Again the conversations hit the mark, although this time it goes in a basic root direction. It's still interesting and intriguing, even if your one of those audiences that actually thought about some of the topics in the conversation. I am not quite sure how much is ad-lib or improvised but the direction is believable and realistic. Maybe it's because both the actor and actress put few of their own real life in put, such as how Ethan Hawke is really born and raised in Texas. The conversations is basically pseudo-intellectual and philosophical view points and questions. The chemistry and connection between the two lead characters is strong. This time Ethan Hawke's character Jesse is the pessimist and slightly not as likable. While the lead actress is a optimist and likable for this first installment. The dialogues or conversations touches upon life, death, religions, relationships, and love. So although it touches on the basics, it's still a immersive film. And I enjoyed it, maybe for it's realism and thought provoking effects. Even if some areas I could agree with while others not so much. 7.8/10

    18 years... 18 years after this film released I've finally pulled the trigger to film it. I've seem copious films decades earlier than this and obviously younger than this. But alas, a highly-acclaimed film has to be seen sometime. It's not a mind-blowing film, yet in a degree the best world I can describe this is; heartwarming, comforting... and very safe. The dialogues & humanity in this film explicitly showing the humane emotions & ambiguity among people. Yet the writer/director showed it in such a way that it is never provocative, edgy or pretentious. It is just good-old human emotion manifested in dialogues between 2 estranged lovebirds. It's never boring despite the continuous dialogues. This is a possibly a sign of human's penchant to voyeurism & gossiping, but that's a bit too much for this.

    Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love. Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures. But it still never feels like this is a clich&eacute; or tries to get some cheap shots in to make you laugh. This feels genuine and as viewers we can and should appreciate that. So while this is not necessary watching, you should take a look at this before ... watching the sequels!

    Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy by Richard Linklater, is a very powerful, thought-provoking film that I never thought would be good. This film has no action and is merely conversation, so how can this movie be so good? Well, this movie is about as close to reality as you can get. What happens in this movie could happen to anybody out there. Secondly, the script is tight and well-written. I really loved all these meaningful, philosophical conversations. I'm usually bored at mostly talk films, but the way I was grabbed into these conversations really means the movie worked. Linklater's film is about a French girl on her way back to school and an American guy heading to Vienna to take a flight home and how they started a connection with each other when they met on the train. The acting is about as good as you can get. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry and the way they delivered the dialog is just special. There is no need for supporting characters because the focus is on these two characters and their meanings of life. Overall, this is a very special, powerful film. I honestly didn't want to see this movie since I thought it would be a stupid romantic comedy, but it is really not. It's a drama that's thoughtful, funny, poignant, and just very sweet. I honestly don't get this "R" rating because the dialog would be very meaningful for teens. For those who love cinema, this is a great movie to watch. I rate this film 9/10.

    In my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have come to number 246, which is "Before Sunrise" directed by Richard Linklater. Before I saw it I just thought it would be some dumb 90s romance flick, but my prediction was proved wrong. This movie was actually quiet enjoyable. American Jesse Wallace meets the French girl C&eacute;line on a train from Budapest. They have a great chat and come to like each other. C&eacute;line is on her way to Paris, while Jesse is going on a plane from Vienna back to the United States. When the train stops in Vienna he convinces her to spend the night with him in the city. Through the movie they have several interesting conversations about everything between heaven and earth and they are quiet interesting. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do a great job in their lead roles as Jesse and C&eacute;line. The movie is very beautiful too and does have some kind of special magic over it. I recommend it if you are in for a special treat. So overall it's a pretty good movie and I will give it 8 out of 10 stars.

    Recommended by a good friend, Before Sunrise is probably one of the most memorable romantic movies I have seen. There is nothing like it and its simplicity is, I think, what compelled people to love it. The movie, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply, is about both young American Jesse and French Celine. They met in a train bound for Vienna and talked a little about each other. Each has no idea where their simple conversation would lead. Everything that happened on that day happened naturally, all unplanned. They spent the night in Vienna, walking around the city, visiting famous landmarks and talking, revealing details about themselves like they've been friends for quite some time. It's a no brainer to figure out that there is going to be more of Jesse's introduction/pep talk to Celine on the train. And while waiting for something out of the ordinary in the plot, I find myself enjoying the mundane things the film is showing. As I've said, it's the simplicity of the movie that draws its audience to finishing it and listening intently to the lines of the characters. Three things that I like about Before Sunrise are as follows: 1. Good script. Not great but good. But that is the beauty of it, there are no filled with ripe wisdom lines that characters are throwing but the good script makes audience know who is the cynic and who is the romantic at heart but is careful at loving. The script even makes it worth waiting how the film is going to end. 2. Good theme. This one is one of the things unmasked by number 1. Jesse and Celine have fallen into minor disagreements and I find myself comfortable with it. I don't even take sides, I just let it be. I enjoy the role of an observer. Point is, the characters are two young souls who are still in the process of knowing themselves and having been through experiences that may have torn them but they talk about it comfortably. Their self-discovery is a work in progress and their self- fulfillment could be a case-to-case basis but it's there. 3. Sense of Wonder. Unlike some friends who were left hanging with the story's ending, I was basking in the sense of wonder. I actually find this part realistic. After knowing that a romance is brewing and realizing that the film's about to end, I enjoyed wondering what it is going to be for Jesse and Celine. Before Sunrise is no perfect movie but it will make you feel better about a lot of things: life, love, friends, family, and faith. If these things interest you, this one is for you. Highly recommended!

    Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy by Richard Linklater, is a very powerful, thought-provoking film that I never thought would be good. This film has no action and is merely conversation, so how can this movie be so good? Well, this movie is about as close to reality as you can get. What happens in this movie could happen to anybody out there. Secondly, the script is tight and well-written. I really loved all these meaningful, philosophical conversations. I'm usually bored at mostly talk films, but the way I was grabbed into these conversations really means the movie worked. Linklater's film is about a French girl on her way back to school and an American guy heading to Vienna to take a flight home and how they started a connection with each other when they met on the train. The acting is about as good as you can get. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry and the way they delivered the dialog is just special. There is no need for supporting characters because the focus is on these two characters and their meanings of life. Overall, this is a very special, powerful film. I honestly didn't want to see this movie since I thought it would be a stupid romantic comedy, but it is really not. It's a drama that's thoughtful, funny, poignant, and just very sweet. I honestly don't get this "R" rating because the dialog would be very meaningful for teens. For those who love cinema, this is a great movie to watch. I rate this film 9/10.

    In my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have come to number 246, which is "Before Sunrise" directed by Richard Linklater. Before I saw it I just thought it would be some dumb 90s romance flick, but my prediction was proved wrong. This movie was actually quiet enjoyable. American Jesse Wallace meets the French girl C&eacute;line on a train from Budapest. They have a great chat and come to like each other. C&eacute;line is on her way to Paris, while Jesse is going on a plane from Vienna back to the United States. When the train stops in Vienna he convinces her to spend the night with him in the city. Through the movie they have several interesting conversations about everything between heaven and earth and they are quiet interesting. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do a great job in their lead roles as Jesse and C&eacute;line. The movie is very beautiful too and does have some kind of special magic over it. I recommend it if you are in for a special treat. So overall it's a pretty good movie and I will give it 8 out of 10 stars.

    Recommended by a good friend, Before Sunrise is probably one of the most memorable romantic movies I have seen. There is nothing like it and its simplicity is, I think, what compelled people to love it. The movie, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply, is about both young American Jesse and French Celine. They met in a train bound for Vienna and talked a little about each other. Each has no idea where their simple conversation would lead. Everything that happened on that day happened naturally, all unplanned. They spent the night in Vienna, walking around the city, visiting famous landmarks and talking, revealing details about themselves like they've been friends for quite some time. It's a no brainer to figure out that there is going to be more of Jesse's introduction/pep talk to Celine on the train. And while waiting for something out of the ordinary in the plot, I find myself enjoying the mundane things the film is showing. As I've said, it's the simplicity of the movie that draws its audience to finishing it and listening intently to the lines of the characters. Three things that I like about Before Sunrise are as follows: 1. Good script. Not great but good. But that is the beauty of it, there are no filled with ripe wisdom lines that characters are throwing but the good script makes audience know who is the cynic and who is the romantic at heart but is careful at loving. The script even makes it worth waiting how the film is going to end. 2. Good theme. This one is one of the things unmasked by number 1. Jesse and Celine have fallen into minor disagreements and I find myself comfortable with it. I don't even take sides, I just let it be. I enjoy the role of an observer. Point is, the characters are two young souls who are still in the process of knowing themselves and having been through experiences that may have torn them but they talk about it comfortably. Their self-discovery is a work in progress and their self- fulfillment could be a case-to-case basis but it's there. 3. Sense of Wonder. Unlike some friends who were left hanging with the story's ending, I was basking in the sense of wonder. I actually find this part realistic. After knowing that a romance is brewing and realizing that the film's about to end, I enjoyed wondering what it is going to be for Jesse and Celine. Before Sunrise is no perfect movie but it will make you feel better about a lot of things: life, love, friends, family, and faith. If these things interest you, this one is for you. Highly recommended!

    This is about the accidental meeting of two mid-20s age college students: "Jesse" (Ethan Hawke) and "Celine" (Julie Delpy). He's returning from a disappointing visit to his girlfriend in Spain (she's in an international student program but has fallen in love with another student and dumped Jesse). He's near broke and on a train to Vienna from where he'll take his cheapest flight back to the USA. Celine's on the same train, returning to her home in Paris when they meet. Although French, she's studied in the USA and speaks excellent English. Jesse asks - and Celine agrees - to interrupt her trip to spend a few more hours together exploring Vienna before his plane leaves. Gradually, as they get to know each other, they become more deeply attached. As Roger Ebert said, "This sort of scenario has happened....millions of times. It has rarely happened in a nicer, sweeter, more gentle way.... (It's) so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera." This is the first film (so far, of 3) by Linklater starring Delpy and Hawke, each filmed 9 years apart: "Before Sunset" (2004) & "Before Midnight" (2013). While it'd be nice to see them in order, each one is so good, so unique and satisfying that it's more important to just see them. The series is about relationships: how do we get to know others and let others know us, how do we handle differences, conflicts? To what would a long term relationship with this person lead? - satisfaction? - disappointment? How much of which? How can we tell? This film's opening raises those questions by example: on the train ride, Celine's bothered by the loud conversation of a long married, middle-aged couple across the aisle from her: they argue so loudly (and obviously chronically) about? - whatever, everything - that Celine moves and finds herself across the aisle from Jesse. Their conversation starts - and where will this go? That's the gist of this marvelous, very unique movie. People who prefer car chases and explosions should avoid it--no action of that kind, whatsover; it's all just talk--but, for many of us, what exciting talk that keeps us wondering to where it will lead!!

    Jessie and Celine meet on a train in Austria. Based on short conversation, both of them take a chance and get off together in Vienna. They go on to spend one of the greatest nights of their lives, sharing an experience neither character will ever be able to forget. I love the fundamental idea of this movie. That two complete strangers can forge such a deep connection based on a such a brief interaction is very intriguing. Are there potential soul mates hidden in the world for all of us, just waiting for you to talk to them? It is a very hopeful start to Linklater's series of movies, and one that is important to reflect on as you watch the following movies. The dialogue is written fantastically with natural conversation that flows. The characters touch on universal themes that couples all through time have chatted and argued about, and you can feel their attraction building as more and more of their personalities are revealed to each other. I love Julie Delpy's French accent, too! This movie blew me away on first viewing, but it wasn't until Before Sunset that I truly fell in love with this couple. This movie features several extremely long takes, which work perfectly in creating the feeling that you are actually spending the night with Jessie and Celine in real time. I would recommend seeing both movies before you judge this as another fluffy love story. Re-watching this after seeing the second movie made me like it even more, and I would honestly rate this above nearly every other romance movie I have seen for its completely genuine feeling.

    Lucky me. A couple of months ago, I got to experience the entire BEFORE trilogy and not have to wait 18 years to reach the (possible) end. When Before Midnight was released in summer 2013, I had a full day of BEFORE movies and was pleasantly pleased. The first, Before Sunrise, is the only one I'd seen before. A long, long time ago. I really did like it back then, and with this second viewing, I still admired it and loved how it holds up today, 18-years-later. I absolutely loved the dialogue, the originality and especially the camera following these two strangers who were destined to be with each other. The movie starts with the unlikely pairing of an American on holiday in Europe who meets his instant attraction, a French student. Both are on a train, but with different stops and yet, he convinces her to debark with him in Vienna. For one solid day/evening/morning, they literally walk and talk and get to know each other. Of course, they fall in love  so much so, that the "lust" they thought they knew was relevant at first, wasn't that at all. These two were meant to be together. It takes balls for Director and Writer Richard Linklater to pull off a 105 minute movie based solely on walking and talking and only truly starring two unknowns, buthe pulled it off. The dialogue was crisp, the connection and charisma was present and the originality of such a basic, yet deep, film was refreshing. People in real life only dream about this kind of chance encounter. This may be fantasy, but it's one that many, including myself, would yearn our whole lives for. If you don't get the sense of true love, true connection and true meaning upon the finale of this film, you might want to restart the film. I did laugh, I did admire and I did fall in love with these two. I even loved the ambiguous climax. This was a love story that you'd love to read in a great novel and cherish every moment. Finally, I loved the simplicity of this film. Kudos to Linklater for such a great experiment that worked. If there were no sequels, which are certainly very good on their own, I would be okay with how this movie can stand alone.

    I have been aware of this film for quite some time having never seen it. Perhaps this is for the best for I was too young to understand the raw substance this film contained. Synopsis: Before Sunrise brings to life an experience between two human beings who find themselves connected to one another. With only a single day to themselves before heading back to their "lives" these two creatures engage in a dialogue about love, death, and life while enjoying the scenes of Vienna, Austria. Review: For a film that is virtually all dialogue, Before Sunrise holds up remarkably well. It's a great capture of human interaction contrasting other well-made dialogue films like: Glengarry Glen Ross and 12 Angry Men. The day that transpires between these two is entertaining, funny, and inspires one's own thoughts into the topics discussed between Celine and Jesse. It is not the typical love story. It's a love story where two people discuss their views on love and whether or not love itself even exists. A scene following the characters departing from a train to spend the day together reveals honest direction of dialogue between Jesse and Celine. While they had just met only a few hours before, they both confess to their feelings of awkwardness after their spontaneous decision to get to know each other. Honesty captured in this way is very nice to see. Instead of trying to correct this awkwardness, they acknowledge it and decide to take the moment wherever it leads. Astounding! What follows are healthy discussions and honest debates about the topics they address all while being vulnerable and having nothing to lose, except for their short time together.

    This is a start of a realistic connecting romance movie from a trilogy. Now I saw "Before Sunset" before seeing this one. But wished I have saw this first, since it's the first movie in this "Before" trilogy. The story is about two people meeting and as they converse, they start to build a bond with each other. While also sightseeing and experience their time in Vienna for a evening. Again the conversations hit the mark, although this time it goes in a basic root direction. It's still interesting and intriguing, even if your one of those audiences that actually thought about some of the topics in the conversation. I am not quite sure how much is ad-lib or improvised but the direction is believable and realistic. Maybe it's because both the actor and actress put few of their own real life in put, such as how Ethan Hawke is really born and raised in Texas. The conversations is basically pseudo-intellectual and philosophical view points and questions. The chemistry and connection between the two lead characters is strong. This time Ethan Hawke's character Jesse is the pessimist and slightly not as likable. While the lead actress is a optimist and likable for this first installment. The dialogues or conversations touches upon life, death, religions, relationships, and love. So although it touches on the basics, it's still a immersive film. And I enjoyed it, maybe for it's realism and thought provoking effects. Even if some areas I could agree with while others not so much. 7.8/10

    18 years... 18 years after this film released I've finally pulled the trigger to film it. I've seem copious films decades earlier than this and obviously younger than this. But alas, a highly-acclaimed film has to be seen sometime. It's not a mind-blowing film, yet in a degree the best world I can describe this is; heartwarming, comforting... and very safe. The dialogues & humanity in this film explicitly showing the humane emotions & ambiguity among people. Yet the writer/director showed it in such a way that it is never provocative, edgy or pretentious. It is just good-old human emotion manifested in dialogues between 2 estranged lovebirds. It's never boring despite the continuous dialogues. This is a possibly a sign of human's penchant to voyeurism & gossiping, but that's a bit too much for this.

    Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love. Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures. But it still never feels like this is a clich&eacute; or tries to get some cheap shots in to make you laugh. This feels genuine and as viewers we can and should appreciate that. So while this is not necessary watching, you should take a look at this before ... watching the sequels!

What follows are healthy discussions and honest debates about the topics they address all while being vulnerable and having nothing to lose, except for their short time together.

    This is a start of a realistic connecting romance movie from a trilogy. Now I saw "Before Sunset" before seeing this one. But wished I have saw this first, since it's the first movie in this "Before" trilogy. The story is about two people meeting and as they converse, they start to build a bond with each other. While also sightseeing and experience their time in Vienna for a evening. Again the conversations hit the mark, although this time it goes in a basic root direction. It's still interesting and intriguing, even if your one of those audiences that actually thought about some of the topics in the conversation. I am not quite sure how much is ad-lib or improvised but the direction is believable and realistic. Maybe it's because both the actor and actress put few of their own real life in put, such as how Ethan Hawke is really born and raised in Texas. The conversations is basically pseudo-intellectual and philosophical view points and questions. The chemistry and connection between the two lead characters is strong. This time Ethan Hawke's character Jesse is the pessimist and slightly not as likable. While the lead actress is a optimist and likable for this first installment. The dialogues or conversations touches upon life, death, religions, relationships, and love. So although it touches on the basics, it's still a immersive film. And I enjoyed it, maybe for it's realism and thought provoking effects. Even if some areas I could agree with while others not so much. 7.8/10

    18 years... 18 years after this film released I've finally pulled the trigger to film it. I've seem copious films decades earlier than this and obviously younger than this. But alas, a highly-acclaimed film has to be seen sometime. It's not a mind-blowing film, yet in a degree the best world I can describe this is; heartwarming, comforting... and very safe. The dialogues & humanity in this film explicitly showing the humane emotions & ambiguity among people. Yet the writer/director showed it in such a way that it is never provocative, edgy or pretentious. It is just good-old human emotion manifested in dialogues between 2 estranged lovebirds. It's never boring despite the continuous dialogues. This is a possibly a sign of human's penchant to voyeurism & gossiping, but that's a bit too much for this.

    Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love. Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures. But it still never feels like this is a clich&eacute; or tries to get some cheap shots in to make you laugh. This feels genuine and as viewers we can and should appreciate that. So while this is not necessary watching, you should take a look at this before ... watching the sequels!

    Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy by Richard Linklater, is a very powerful, thought-provoking film that I never thought would be good. This film has no action and is merely conversation, so how can this movie be so good? Well, this movie is about as close to reality as you can get. What happens in this movie could happen to anybody out there. Secondly, the script is tight and well-written. I really loved all these meaningful, philosophical conversations. I'm usually bored at mostly talk films, but the way I was grabbed into these conversations really means the movie worked. Linklater's film is about a French girl on her way back to school and an American guy heading to Vienna to take a flight home and how they started a connection with each other when they met on the train. The acting is about as good as you can get. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry and the way they delivered the dialog is just special. There is no need for supporting characters because the focus is on these two characters and their meanings of life. Overall, this is a very special, powerful film. I honestly didn't want to see this movie since I thought it would be a stupid romantic comedy, but it is really not. It's a drama that's thoughtful, funny, poignant, and just very sweet. I honestly don't get this "R" rating because the dialog would be very meaningful for teens. For those who love cinema, this is a great movie to watch. I rate this film 9/10.

    In my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have come to number 246, which is "Before Sunrise" directed by Richard Linklater. Before I saw it I just thought it would be some dumb 90s romance flick, but my prediction was proved wrong. This movie was actually quiet enjoyable. American Jesse Wallace meets the French girl C&eacute;line on a train from Budapest. They have a great chat and come to like each other. C&eacute;line is on her way to Paris, while Jesse is going on a plane from Vienna back to the United States. When the train stops in Vienna he convinces her to spend the night with him in the city. Through the movie they have several interesting conversations about everything between heaven and earth and they are quiet interesting. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do a great job in their lead roles as Jesse and C&eacute;line. The movie is very beautiful too and does have some kind of special magic over it. I recommend it if you are in for a special treat. So overall it's a pretty good movie and I will give it 8 out of 10 stars.

    Recommended by a good friend, Before Sunrise is probably one of the most memorable romantic movies I have seen. There is nothing like it and its simplicity is, I think, what compelled people to love it. The movie, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply, is about both young American Jesse and French Celine. They met in a train bound for Vienna and talked a little about each other. Each has no idea where their simple conversation would lead. Everything that happened on that day happened naturally, all unplanned. They spent the night in Vienna, walking around the city, visiting famous landmarks and talking, revealing details about themselves like they've been friends for quite some time. It's a no brainer to figure out that there is going to be more of Jesse's introduction/pep talk to Celine on the train. And while waiting for something out of the ordinary in the plot, I find myself enjoying the mundane things the film is showing. As I've said, it's the simplicity of the movie that draws its audience to finishing it and listening intently to the lines of the characters. Three things that I like about Before Sunrise are as follows: 1. Good script. Not great but good. But that is the beauty of it, there are no filled with ripe wisdom lines that characters are throwing but the good script makes audience know who is the cynic and who is the romantic at heart but is careful at loving. The script even makes it worth waiting how the film is going to end. 2. Good theme. This one is one of the things unmasked by number 1. Jesse and Celine have fallen into minor disagreements and I find myself comfortable with it. I don't even take sides, I just let it be. I enjoy the role of an observer. Point is, the characters are two young souls who are still in the process of knowing themselves and having been through experiences that may have torn them but they talk about it comfortably. Their self-discovery is a work in progress and their self- fulfillment could be a case-to-case basis but it's there. 3. Sense of Wonder. Unlike some friends who were left hanging with the story's ending, I was basking in the sense of wonder. I actually find this part realistic. After knowing that a romance is brewing and realizing that the film's about to end, I enjoyed wondering what it is going to be for Jesse and Celine. Before Sunrise is no perfect movie but it will make you feel better about a lot of things: life, love, friends, family, and faith. If these things interest you, this one is for you. Highly recommended!

    This is about the accidental meeting of two mid-20s age college students: "Jesse" (Ethan Hawke) and "Celine" (Julie Delpy). He's returning from a disappointing visit to his girlfriend in Spain (she's in an international student program but has fallen in love with another student and dumped Jesse). He's near broke and on a train to Vienna from where he'll take his cheapest flight back to the USA. Celine's on the same train, returning to her home in Paris when they meet. Although French, she's studied in the USA and speaks excellent English. Jesse asks - and Celine agrees - to interrupt her trip to spend a few more hours together exploring Vienna before his plane leaves. Gradually, as they get to know each other, they become more deeply attached. As Roger Ebert said, "This sort of scenario has happened....millions of times. It has rarely happened in a nicer, sweeter, more gentle way.... (It's) so much like real life - like a documentary with an invisible camera." This is the first film (so far, of 3) by Linklater starring Delpy and Hawke, each filmed 9 years apart: "Before Sunset" (2004) & "Before Midnight" (2013). While it'd be nice to see them in order, each one is so good, so unique and satisfying that it's more important to just see them. The series is about relationships: how do we get to know others and let others know us, how do we handle differences, conflicts? To what would a long term relationship with this person lead? - satisfaction? - disappointment? How much of which? How can we tell? This film's opening raises those questions by example: on the train ride, Celine's bothered by the loud conversation of a long married, middle-aged couple across the aisle from her: they argue so loudly (and obviously chronically) about? - whatever, everything - that Celine moves and finds herself across the aisle from Jesse. Their conversation starts - and where will this go? That's the gist of this marvelous, very unique movie. People who prefer car chases and explosions should avoid it--no action of that kind, whatsover; it's all just talk--but, for many of us, what exciting talk that keeps us wondering to where it will lead!!

    Jessie and Celine meet on a train in Austria. Based on short conversation, both of them take a chance and get off together in Vienna. They go on to spend one of the greatest nights of their lives, sharing an experience neither character will ever be able to forget. I love the fundamental idea of this movie. That two complete strangers can forge such a deep connection based on a such a brief interaction is very intriguing. Are there potential soul mates hidden in the world for all of us, just waiting for you to talk to them? It is a very hopeful start to Linklater's series of movies, and one that is important to reflect on as you watch the following movies. The dialogue is written fantastically with natural conversation that flows. The characters touch on universal themes that couples all through time have chatted and argued about, and you can feel their attraction building as more and more of their personalities are revealed to each other. I love Julie Delpy's French accent, too! This movie blew me away on first viewing, but it wasn't until Before Sunset that I truly fell in love with this couple. This movie features several extremely long takes, which work perfectly in creating the feeling that you are actually spending the night with Jessie and Celine in real time. I would recommend seeing both movies before you judge this as another fluffy love story. Re-watching this after seeing the second movie made me like it even more, and I would honestly rate this above nearly every other romance movie I have seen for its completely genuine feeling.

    Lucky me. A couple of months ago, I got to experience the entire BEFORE trilogy and not have to wait 18 years to reach the (possible) end. When Before Midnight was released in summer 2013, I had a full day of BEFORE movies and was pleasantly pleased. The first, Before Sunrise, is the only one I'd seen before. A long, long time ago. I really did like it back then, and with this second viewing, I still admired it and loved how it holds up today, 18-years-later. I absolutely loved the dialogue, the originality and especially the camera following these two strangers who were destined to be with each other. The movie starts with the unlikely pairing of an American on holiday in Europe who meets his instant attraction, a French student. Both are on a train, but with different stops and yet, he convinces her to debark with him in Vienna. For one solid day/evening/morning, they literally walk and talk and get to know each other. Of course, they fall in love  so much so, that the "lust" they thought they knew was relevant at first, wasn't that at all. These two were meant to be together. It takes balls for Director and Writer Richard Linklater to pull off a 105 minute movie based solely on walking and talking and only truly starring two unknowns, buthe pulled it off. The dialogue was crisp, the connection and charisma was present and the originality of such a basic, yet deep, film was refreshing. People in real life only dream about this kind of chance encounter. This may be fantasy, but it's one that many, including myself, would yearn our whole lives for. If you don't get the sense of true love, true connection and true meaning upon the finale of this film, you might want to restart the film. I did laugh, I did admire and I did fall in love with these two. I even loved the ambiguous climax. This was a love story that you'd love to read in a great novel and cherish every moment. Finally, I loved the simplicity of this film. Kudos to Linklater for such a great experiment that worked. If there were no sequels, which are certainly very good on their own, I would be okay with how this movie can stand alone.

    I have been aware of this film for quite some time having never seen it. Perhaps this is for the best for I was too young to understand the raw substance this film contained. Synopsis: Before Sunrise brings to life an experience between two human beings who find themselves connected to one another. With only a single day to themselves before heading back to their "lives" these two creatures engage in a dialogue about love, death, and life while enjoying the scenes of Vienna, Austria. Review: For a film that is virtually all dialogue, Before Sunrise holds up remarkably well. It's a great capture of human interaction contrasting other well-made dialogue films like: Glengarry Glen Ross and 12 Angry Men. The day that transpires between these two is entertaining, funny, and inspires one's own thoughts into the topics discussed between Celine and Jesse. It is not the typical love story. It's a love story where two people discuss their views on love and whether or not love itself even exists. A scene following the characters departing from a train to spend the day together reveals honest direction of dialogue between Jesse and Celine. While they had just met only a few hours before, they both confess to their feelings of awkwardness after their spontaneous decision to get to know each other. Honesty captured in this way is very nice to see. Instead of trying to correct this awkwardness, they acknowledge it and decide to take the moment wherever it leads. Astounding! What follows are healthy discussions and honest debates about the topics they address all while being vulnerable and having nothing to lose, except for their short time together.
