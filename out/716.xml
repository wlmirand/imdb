    The two movies share the same theme: spending a holiday with relatives that turns into a nightmare. Here, it's even better as it's the child (Holly) who returns to her family. It happens to me also and it's true that we travel by grinding our teethes: it warms the heart to see again the family, our familiar places but now, we are adult and it also feels like a cage! Unfortunately, this good plot is totally destroyed by an unintelligible script: the characters speak English, but can someone understand the lines? It's porridge, it means nothing, it's surrealist just to be surrealist and worst, it's not even funny or moving! The aunt is stupid like the sister and brother in law, the mother talks too much for nothing, the father is a video addict! Holly seemed cute, fragile at first but at the end, she didn't do much! In addition, the soundtrack with a lot of bad songs is just irritating and Jodie is there a poor director: all the opening credit is about a painting that we don't see! She zooms in Holly (1,57m) and McDermott (1,83m) so we have only the head of the first and the second has his forehead cut! The only interesting thing is the unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr, so puffy that he looked like a Javier Bardem. Finally, i thought after watching "Always", that Holly was a fine actress but after having watched this crap, stupid "Crash" and her horrible TV show, i really wonder....

    How many out there look forward to Thanksgiving? The turkey, the stuffing the time spent with family you haven't seen in months, if not longer? What if, when it finally arrives, you just wish it would end? Claudia Larson (played by Holly Hunter) is a former artist who now works as a restorer in a Chicago museum. She is summoned to her employer's office during work, but does not know why. Her boss, Peter Arnold (played by Austin Pendleton) informs her that, despite overwhelming enthusiasm for her profession, she is being fired. Claudia protests and mentions coworkers that she believes more worthy of termination, only to find out that, for budgetary reasons, those same coworkers will be fired also. For no apparent reason, she proceeds to kiss her now former boss which ends with her unceremoniously sneezing. He then says, "God I hate the holidays" and that is the last we see of him. With Thanksgiving approaching, Claudia is driven to the airport by her daughter Kitt (played by Claire Danes) and told that she intends to lose her virginity over the holiday, as she will be spending it with her long-time boyfriend and his family. After entering the airport, the hustle and bustle of the season causes her to lose her coat. She calls her brother, Tommy (played by Robert Downey Jr.) from the plane and, getting his answering machine, proceeds to dictate all of these recent developments to a cassette tape. When her plane lands, she is greeted by her parents Adele and Henry Larson. Adele (played by Anne Bancroft) is a housewife and, before actually speaking to her daughter she remarks on her looks. Henry (played by Charles Durning) is a retired airport worker who is called Tubby by his wife and who is simply happy to see his daughter. The drive home and the day before Thanksgiving are fairly uneventful. The occasion itself, anything but. This is a great movie. There is an obvious difference between "holiday movies" and movies that simply take place during the holidays. While A Christmas Story and the Home Alone series would be the former, Millions, another favorite of mine, and Home for the Holidays would be the latter. Members of the family just don't get along; the holiday itself is more nightmarish than heartwarming and, in spite of that, there is still a tearful goodbye as the family departs at the conclusion of the festivities. This is a movie you can, and should, watch year-round.

    The editing focuses on the actors plying their crafts. The actors soar because the writing soars. Well, there may have been other factors contributing to Downey's soaring. And the film flies because the story has a fine, cantilevered arc. If you enjoy fine theater, you'll love this flick. It's interesting: Hollywood pushes a fairly constricted idea of film. I'm not saying Hollywood stinks; it's just important not to think that's all film can be. And "Home for the Holidays" is a fine way to take a break from Hollywood. Give yourself that break; you deserve it. I really don't want to say anything about content. There's so much to recommend the flick, starting with the perfect writing, that it feels like it could almost have any content and somehow be wonderful.

    Entirely appropriate for Thanksgiving because this has got to be one of the worst turkeys ever made. Characters, dialog, music...it's all a train wreck. Billed as a comedy, it lacks that quality of humor the ancient Greeks called "being funny." Or even remotely so. I'm not of the school that has to like characters, though it's helpful. But if they're not likable, there should be something interesting, something that provokes thought, incites something beyond a mere "Eeeuw!" reaction. Not sure where we obtained this DVD, who inflicted it upon us. We made it about half way through.I haven't written a review in quite a while but I logged on just to add a "Beware, turn away while you still have time" notice.

    This move was about two self-centered self-indulgent family members who could care less about whether they are making the rest of their family miserable. Sure the family may not be the Brady Bunch but whose is? And some movies manage to be humorous about that but not this one. Claudia and her brother were just mean spirited, not funny. Can't believe Jodie Foster was involved in this. The performances and production are good. I haven't watched it since reading that Downey was on drugs but I didn't notice at the time. Essentially I think this movie missed the mark of holiday movies that poke fun at dysfunctional families with the idea that we all have them but love them. I couldn't stand the two main characters. I felt sorry for the sister.

    I was drawn by the impressive array of actors that was brought together. It sounded like it couldn't miss, and a comedy of a family struggling through a hectic Thanksgiving is usually an tried and true formula. So how did the talent here manage to botch the job? I think the main culprit is the script. The people who populate this film are not believable people, but cut-out stereotypes from a sitcom writer in a hurry to get a paycheck. In addition, all of the characters are so exasperating, I found myself hoping that a meteor would land on the dining room. The humor is so abrasive and the slapstick is so noisy, I couldn't laugh if I wanted to. A lot of the humor is derisive and mean-spirited, like a WASP version of an Andrew Dice Clay Thanksgiving. Then the film tries to cover it up by going all lovey-dovey during the final reels and risked the health of viewers with bad teeth. I will say this much in the film's favor- the actors do the best they can with the material it's given. There are some quiet scenes that work well and I wish there had been more of them. The film is bad, but it could have been even worse. I would rate it barely tolerable.

    Holly Hunter stars as a woman who finds out she's not quite making it just before she heads home to Baltimore for Thanksgiving, where an overbearing mother, slightly whacked-out father are waiting for their children to return home to the nest, including her homosexual brother who's very well known for his antics and escapades. I'm not sure where to begin, except that the genres for this film are seriously backwards. Don't get me wrong...I like the movie, but I found more drama than comedy in it. And there's that old saying about, "Look in the dictionary under (insert word here) and you'll find my family picture as the illustration," and dysfunctional is DEFINITELY Hunter's family in this case. It's not stupid comedy, and it's not a stupid movie, but it's not really that funny, either. 3 out of 10 stars.

    This movie is so great - totally under-rated. I love to watch it every year around Thanksgiving or Christmas. Watching this movie always reminds me of how families are - the different dynamics between family members. On top of that, it makes me laugh throughout the film every time. The cast of this film is great and it is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again. So give this movie a chance - you will laugh, you will feel happy, there will be peace on earth, and everyone will walk around and give each other hugs and say "see, your family is pretty normal."

    A script lacking dramatic weight and humorous bite, along with characters that are just too 'off centre', mean that Jodie Foster's second outing as director is not a terribly memorable one. Holly Hunter, always an enjoyable screen presence, impresses as Claudia Larson, a single mother who finds herself making yet another annual flight to celebrate thanksgiving with her painful family. All this on top of losing her job and discovering that her sixteen year old daughter is about to begin having sexual relations with her boyfriend. Life sucks sometimes! Unfortunately Holly's character is really the only one the audience is going to be able to relate to, or even stomach for that matter. Anne Bancroft's mom is a nightmare of paranoia, dad (Charles Durning) is a nostalgic, rotund old fool who is quite possibly losing his grip, while sister and brother-in-law (Cynthia Stevenson and Steve Guttenberg) are obnoxious and self-centred. Add to this a nutty Aunt (Geraldine Chaplin) and a totally flaky and intensely irritating homosexual brother (a most unlikeable Robert Downey Jnr.) and you find it very hard to feel sympathy for, get involved with, or laugh at any of this sorry lot. The screenplay swings from drama to comedy to romance to tragedy on many occasions, but Foster is unable to gain effect in any of these modes. In the end neither cast nor crew can pick up the pieces of what was really a misdirected project to begin with. My advice......don't bother going "Home for the Holidays."

    I came to this movie just this year (2007) on broadcast TV, sleepless, facing my first Thanksgiving after my own Mother's death, with the added gift of NO ONE in my family speaking to each other, NO ONE coming for Thanksgiving. I thought I'd watch a bit of fluff as a kind of perverse combination 'sneer-fest' and pity party. You know, thinking: "Oh yeah, Jodie Foster? Why don't you just show us all a bit of holiday family snarky 'everybody-feels-great-underneath-no-really-they do' barf, okay? Like you, like anyone, would know how cruel, petty, mean and heartbreakingly real families are- and how much we, how much I, need them." So, now I own it. And tonight, after a Thanksgiving and a Christmas where everyone really did stay away from each other, I watched it again. I can't add to the well thought out and well written reviews of the movie here (yes, Robert Downey, my favorite actor, is brilliant, Holly Hunter, another favorite, is breaking my heart; Anne Bancroft a goddess, also breaks my heart and Charles Durning, light on his feet in so many ways, showing just a bit of what he can do) - heck all the actors are on point perfectly, but that's not my reason for writing. Here is: Tonight I listened to Jodie Foster's voice-over and I hear her trying to help us understand why the movie wasn't well received. Jodie, if it wasn't well-received then, it is now. This one's on my shelf forever. Thank you. I hope you know what a brilliant, real, take-no-prisoners, warm the cockles of my jaded heart (my other perennial holiday movies are Jaws, Aliens and Terminator 2, maybe The Ref) movie you've made. Just for me. My Christmas present. Thank you.

Just for me. My Christmas present. Thank you.

    The two movies share the same theme: spending a holiday with relatives that turns into a nightmare. Here, it's even better as it's the child (Holly) who returns to her family. It happens to me also and it's true that we travel by grinding our teethes: it warms the heart to see again the family, our familiar places but now, we are adult and it also feels like a cage! Unfortunately, this good plot is totally destroyed by an unintelligible script: the characters speak English, but can someone understand the lines? It's porridge, it means nothing, it's surrealist just to be surrealist and worst, it's not even funny or moving! The aunt is stupid like the sister and brother in law, the mother talks too much for nothing, the father is a video addict! Holly seemed cute, fragile at first but at the end, she didn't do much! In addition, the soundtrack with a lot of bad songs is just irritating and Jodie is there a poor director: all the opening credit is about a painting that we don't see! She zooms in Holly (1,57m) and McDermott (1,83m) so we have only the head of the first and the second has his forehead cut! The only interesting thing is the unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr, so puffy that he looked like a Javier Bardem. Finally, i thought after watching "Always", that Holly was a fine actress but after having watched this crap, stupid "Crash" and her horrible TV show, i really wonder....

    How many out there look forward to Thanksgiving? The turkey, the stuffing the time spent with family you haven't seen in months, if not longer? What if, when it finally arrives, you just wish it would end? Claudia Larson (played by Holly Hunter) is a former artist who now works as a restorer in a Chicago museum. She is summoned to her employer's office during work, but does not know why. Her boss, Peter Arnold (played by Austin Pendleton) informs her that, despite overwhelming enthusiasm for her profession, she is being fired. Claudia protests and mentions coworkers that she believes more worthy of termination, only to find out that, for budgetary reasons, those same coworkers will be fired also. For no apparent reason, she proceeds to kiss her now former boss which ends with her unceremoniously sneezing. He then says, "God I hate the holidays" and that is the last we see of him. With Thanksgiving approaching, Claudia is driven to the airport by her daughter Kitt (played by Claire Danes) and told that she intends to lose her virginity over the holiday, as she will be spending it with her long-time boyfriend and his family. After entering the airport, the hustle and bustle of the season causes her to lose her coat. She calls her brother, Tommy (played by Robert Downey Jr.) from the plane and, getting his answering machine, proceeds to dictate all of these recent developments to a cassette tape. When her plane lands, she is greeted by her parents Adele and Henry Larson. Adele (played by Anne Bancroft) is a housewife and, before actually speaking to her daughter she remarks on her looks. Henry (played by Charles Durning) is a retired airport worker who is called Tubby by his wife and who is simply happy to see his daughter. The drive home and the day before Thanksgiving are fairly uneventful. The occasion itself, anything but. This is a great movie. There is an obvious difference between "holiday movies" and movies that simply take place during the holidays. While A Christmas Story and the Home Alone series would be the former, Millions, another favorite of mine, and Home for the Holidays would be the latter. Members of the family just don't get along; the holiday itself is more nightmarish than heartwarming and, in spite of that, there is still a tearful goodbye as the family departs at the conclusion of the festivities. This is a movie you can, and should, watch year-round.

    The editing focuses on the actors plying their crafts. The actors soar because the writing soars. Well, there may have been other factors contributing to Downey's soaring. And the film flies because the story has a fine, cantilevered arc. If you enjoy fine theater, you'll love this flick. It's interesting: Hollywood pushes a fairly constricted idea of film. I'm not saying Hollywood stinks; it's just important not to think that's all film can be. And "Home for the Holidays" is a fine way to take a break from Hollywood. Give yourself that break; you deserve it. I really don't want to say anything about content. There's so much to recommend the flick, starting with the perfect writing, that it feels like it could almost have any content and somehow be wonderful.

    Entirely appropriate for Thanksgiving because this has got to be one of the worst turkeys ever made. Characters, dialog, music...it's all a train wreck. Billed as a comedy, it lacks that quality of humor the ancient Greeks called "being funny." Or even remotely so. I'm not of the school that has to like characters, though it's helpful. But if they're not likable, there should be something interesting, something that provokes thought, incites something beyond a mere "Eeeuw!" reaction. Not sure where we obtained this DVD, who inflicted it upon us. We made it about half way through.I haven't written a review in quite a while but I logged on just to add a "Beware, turn away while you still have time" notice.

    This move was about two self-centered self-indulgent family members who could care less about whether they are making the rest of their family miserable. Sure the family may not be the Brady Bunch but whose is? And some movies manage to be humorous about that but not this one. Claudia and her brother were just mean spirited, not funny. Can't believe Jodie Foster was involved in this. The performances and production are good. I haven't watched it since reading that Downey was on drugs but I didn't notice at the time. Essentially I think this movie missed the mark of holiday movies that poke fun at dysfunctional families with the idea that we all have them but love them. I couldn't stand the two main characters. I felt sorry for the sister.

    I was drawn by the impressive array of actors that was brought together. It sounded like it couldn't miss, and a comedy of a family struggling through a hectic Thanksgiving is usually an tried and true formula. So how did the talent here manage to botch the job? I think the main culprit is the script. The people who populate this film are not believable people, but cut-out stereotypes from a sitcom writer in a hurry to get a paycheck. In addition, all of the characters are so exasperating, I found myself hoping that a meteor would land on the dining room. The humor is so abrasive and the slapstick is so noisy, I couldn't laugh if I wanted to. A lot of the humor is derisive and mean-spirited, like a WASP version of an Andrew Dice Clay Thanksgiving. Then the film tries to cover it up by going all lovey-dovey during the final reels and risked the health of viewers with bad teeth. I will say this much in the film's favor- the actors do the best they can with the material it's given. There are some quiet scenes that work well and I wish there had been more of them. The film is bad, but it could have been even worse. I would rate it barely tolerable.

    Holly Hunter stars as a woman who finds out she's not quite making it just before she heads home to Baltimore for Thanksgiving, where an overbearing mother, slightly whacked-out father are waiting for their children to return home to the nest, including her homosexual brother who's very well known for his antics and escapades. I'm not sure where to begin, except that the genres for this film are seriously backwards. Don't get me wrong...I like the movie, but I found more drama than comedy in it. And there's that old saying about, "Look in the dictionary under (insert word here) and you'll find my family picture as the illustration," and dysfunctional is DEFINITELY Hunter's family in this case. It's not stupid comedy, and it's not a stupid movie, but it's not really that funny, either. 3 out of 10 stars.

    This movie is so great - totally under-rated. I love to watch it every year around Thanksgiving or Christmas. Watching this movie always reminds me of how families are - the different dynamics between family members. On top of that, it makes me laugh throughout the film every time. The cast of this film is great and it is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again. So give this movie a chance - you will laugh, you will feel happy, there will be peace on earth, and everyone will walk around and give each other hugs and say "see, your family is pretty normal."

    A script lacking dramatic weight and humorous bite, along with characters that are just too 'off centre', mean that Jodie Foster's second outing as director is not a terribly memorable one. Holly Hunter, always an enjoyable screen presence, impresses as Claudia Larson, a single mother who finds herself making yet another annual flight to celebrate thanksgiving with her painful family. All this on top of losing her job and discovering that her sixteen year old daughter is about to begin having sexual relations with her boyfriend. Life sucks sometimes! Unfortunately Holly's character is really the only one the audience is going to be able to relate to, or even stomach for that matter. Anne Bancroft's mom is a nightmare of paranoia, dad (Charles Durning) is a nostalgic, rotund old fool who is quite possibly losing his grip, while sister and brother-in-law (Cynthia Stevenson and Steve Guttenberg) are obnoxious and self-centred. Add to this a nutty Aunt (Geraldine Chaplin) and a totally flaky and intensely irritating homosexual brother (a most unlikeable Robert Downey Jnr.) and you find it very hard to feel sympathy for, get involved with, or laugh at any of this sorry lot. The screenplay swings from drama to comedy to romance to tragedy on many occasions, but Foster is unable to gain effect in any of these modes. In the end neither cast nor crew can pick up the pieces of what was really a misdirected project to begin with. My advice......don't bother going "Home for the Holidays."

    I came to this movie just this year (2007) on broadcast TV, sleepless, facing my first Thanksgiving after my own Mother's death, with the added gift of NO ONE in my family speaking to each other, NO ONE coming for Thanksgiving. I thought I'd watch a bit of fluff as a kind of perverse combination 'sneer-fest' and pity party. You know, thinking: "Oh yeah, Jodie Foster? Why don't you just show us all a bit of holiday family snarky 'everybody-feels-great-underneath-no-really-they do' barf, okay? Like you, like anyone, would know how cruel, petty, mean and heartbreakingly real families are- and how much we, how much I, need them." So, now I own it. And tonight, after a Thanksgiving and a Christmas where everyone really did stay away from each other, I watched it again. I can't add to the well thought out and well written reviews of the movie here (yes, Robert Downey, my favorite actor, is brilliant, Holly Hunter, another favorite, is breaking my heart; Anne Bancroft a goddess, also breaks my heart and Charles Durning, light on his feet in so many ways, showing just a bit of what he can do) - heck all the actors are on point perfectly, but that's not my reason for writing. Here is: Tonight I listened to Jodie Foster's voice-over and I hear her trying to help us understand why the movie wasn't well received. Jodie, if it wasn't well-received then, it is now. This one's on my shelf forever. Thank you. I hope you know what a brilliant, real, take-no-prisoners, warm the cockles of my jaded heart (my other perennial holiday movies are Jaws, Aliens and Terminator 2, maybe The Ref) movie you've made. Just for me. My Christmas present. Thank you.

    How many out there look forward to Thanksgiving? The turkey, the stuffing the time spent with family you haven't seen in months, if not longer? What if, when it finally arrives, you just wish it would end? Claudia Larson (played by Holly Hunter) is a former artist who now works as a restorer in a Chicago museum. She is summoned to her employer's office during work, but does not know why. Her boss, Peter Arnold (played by Austin Pendleton) informs her that, despite overwhelming enthusiasm for her profession, she is being fired. Claudia protests and mentions coworkers that she believes more worthy of termination, only to find out that, for budgetary reasons, those same coworkers will be fired also. For no apparent reason, she proceeds to kiss her now former boss which ends with her unceremoniously sneezing. He then says, "God I hate the holidays" and that is the last we see of him. With Thanksgiving approaching, Claudia is driven to the airport by her daughter Kitt (played by Claire Danes) and told that she intends to lose her virginity over the holiday, as she will be spending it with her long-time boyfriend and his family. After entering the airport, the hustle and bustle of the season causes her to lose her coat. She calls her brother, Tommy (played by Robert Downey Jr.) from the plane and, getting his answering machine, proceeds to dictate all of these recent developments to a cassette tape. When her plane lands, she is greeted by her parents Adele and Henry Larson. Adele (played by Anne Bancroft) is a housewife and, before actually speaking to her daughter she remarks on her looks. Henry (played by Charles Durning) is a retired airport worker who is called Tubby by his wife and who is simply happy to see his daughter. The drive home and the day before Thanksgiving are fairly uneventful. The occasion itself, anything but. This is a great movie. There is an obvious difference between "holiday movies" and movies that simply take place during the holidays. While A Christmas Story and the Home Alone series would be the former, Millions, another favorite of mine, and Home for the Holidays would be the latter. Members of the family just don't get along; the holiday itself is more nightmarish than heartwarming and, in spite of that, there is still a tearful goodbye as the family departs at the conclusion of the festivities. This is a movie you can, and should, watch year-round.

    The editing focuses on the actors plying their crafts. The actors soar because the writing soars. Well, there may have been other factors contributing to Downey's soaring. And the film flies because the story has a fine, cantilevered arc. If you enjoy fine theater, you'll love this flick. It's interesting: Hollywood pushes a fairly constricted idea of film. I'm not saying Hollywood stinks; it's just important not to think that's all film can be. And "Home for the Holidays" is a fine way to take a break from Hollywood. Give yourself that break; you deserve it. I really don't want to say anything about content. There's so much to recommend the flick, starting with the perfect writing, that it feels like it could almost have any content and somehow be wonderful.

    Entirely appropriate for Thanksgiving because this has got to be one of the worst turkeys ever made. Characters, dialog, music...it's all a train wreck. Billed as a comedy, it lacks that quality of humor the ancient Greeks called "being funny." Or even remotely so. I'm not of the school that has to like characters, though it's helpful. But if they're not likable, there should be something interesting, something that provokes thought, incites something beyond a mere "Eeeuw!" reaction. Not sure where we obtained this DVD, who inflicted it upon us. We made it about half way through.I haven't written a review in quite a while but I logged on just to add a "Beware, turn away while you still have time" notice.

    This move was about two self-centered self-indulgent family members who could care less about whether they are making the rest of their family miserable. Sure the family may not be the Brady Bunch but whose is? And some movies manage to be humorous about that but not this one. Claudia and her brother were just mean spirited, not funny. Can't believe Jodie Foster was involved in this. The performances and production are good. I haven't watched it since reading that Downey was on drugs but I didn't notice at the time. Essentially I think this movie missed the mark of holiday movies that poke fun at dysfunctional families with the idea that we all have them but love them. I couldn't stand the two main characters. I felt sorry for the sister.

    I was drawn by the impressive array of actors that was brought together. It sounded like it couldn't miss, and a comedy of a family struggling through a hectic Thanksgiving is usually an tried and true formula. So how did the talent here manage to botch the job? I think the main culprit is the script. The people who populate this film are not believable people, but cut-out stereotypes from a sitcom writer in a hurry to get a paycheck. In addition, all of the characters are so exasperating, I found myself hoping that a meteor would land on the dining room. The humor is so abrasive and the slapstick is so noisy, I couldn't laugh if I wanted to. A lot of the humor is derisive and mean-spirited, like a WASP version of an Andrew Dice Clay Thanksgiving. Then the film tries to cover it up by going all lovey-dovey during the final reels and risked the health of viewers with bad teeth. I will say this much in the film's favor- the actors do the best they can with the material it's given. There are some quiet scenes that work well and I wish there had been more of them. The film is bad, but it could have been even worse. I would rate it barely tolerable.

    Holly Hunter stars as a woman who finds out she's not quite making it just before she heads home to Baltimore for Thanksgiving, where an overbearing mother, slightly whacked-out father are waiting for their children to return home to the nest, including her homosexual brother who's very well known for his antics and escapades. I'm not sure where to begin, except that the genres for this film are seriously backwards. Don't get me wrong...I like the movie, but I found more drama than comedy in it. And there's that old saying about, "Look in the dictionary under (insert word here) and you'll find my family picture as the illustration," and dysfunctional is DEFINITELY Hunter's family in this case. It's not stupid comedy, and it's not a stupid movie, but it's not really that funny, either. 3 out of 10 stars.

    This movie is so great - totally under-rated. I love to watch it every year around Thanksgiving or Christmas. Watching this movie always reminds me of how families are - the different dynamics between family members. On top of that, it makes me laugh throughout the film every time. The cast of this film is great and it is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again. So give this movie a chance - you will laugh, you will feel happy, there will be peace on earth, and everyone will walk around and give each other hugs and say "see, your family is pretty normal."

    A script lacking dramatic weight and humorous bite, along with characters that are just too 'off centre', mean that Jodie Foster's second outing as director is not a terribly memorable one. Holly Hunter, always an enjoyable screen presence, impresses as Claudia Larson, a single mother who finds herself making yet another annual flight to celebrate thanksgiving with her painful family. All this on top of losing her job and discovering that her sixteen year old daughter is about to begin having sexual relations with her boyfriend. Life sucks sometimes! Unfortunately Holly's character is really the only one the audience is going to be able to relate to, or even stomach for that matter. Anne Bancroft's mom is a nightmare of paranoia, dad (Charles Durning) is a nostalgic, rotund old fool who is quite possibly losing his grip, while sister and brother-in-law (Cynthia Stevenson and Steve Guttenberg) are obnoxious and self-centred. Add to this a nutty Aunt (Geraldine Chaplin) and a totally flaky and intensely irritating homosexual brother (a most unlikeable Robert Downey Jnr.) and you find it very hard to feel sympathy for, get involved with, or laugh at any of this sorry lot. The screenplay swings from drama to comedy to romance to tragedy on many occasions, but Foster is unable to gain effect in any of these modes. In the end neither cast nor crew can pick up the pieces of what was really a misdirected project to begin with. My advice......don't bother going "Home for the Holidays."

    I came to this movie just this year (2007) on broadcast TV, sleepless, facing my first Thanksgiving after my own Mother's death, with the added gift of NO ONE in my family speaking to each other, NO ONE coming for Thanksgiving. I thought I'd watch a bit of fluff as a kind of perverse combination 'sneer-fest' and pity party. You know, thinking: "Oh yeah, Jodie Foster? Why don't you just show us all a bit of holiday family snarky 'everybody-feels-great-underneath-no-really-they do' barf, okay? Like you, like anyone, would know how cruel, petty, mean and heartbreakingly real families are- and how much we, how much I, need them." So, now I own it. And tonight, after a Thanksgiving and a Christmas where everyone really did stay away from each other, I watched it again. I can't add to the well thought out and well written reviews of the movie here (yes, Robert Downey, my favorite actor, is brilliant, Holly Hunter, another favorite, is breaking my heart; Anne Bancroft a goddess, also breaks my heart and Charles Durning, light on his feet in so many ways, showing just a bit of what he can do) - heck all the actors are on point perfectly, but that's not my reason for writing. Here is: Tonight I listened to Jodie Foster's voice-over and I hear her trying to help us understand why the movie wasn't well received. Jodie, if it wasn't well-received then, it is now. This one's on my shelf forever. Thank you. I hope you know what a brilliant, real, take-no-prisoners, warm the cockles of my jaded heart (my other perennial holiday movies are Jaws, Aliens and Terminator 2, maybe The Ref) movie you've made. Just for me. My Christmas present. Thank you.

    The two movies share the same theme: spending a holiday with relatives that turns into a nightmare. Here, it's even better as it's the child (Holly) who returns to her family. It happens to me also and it's true that we travel by grinding our teethes: it warms the heart to see again the family, our familiar places but now, we are adult and it also feels like a cage! Unfortunately, this good plot is totally destroyed by an unintelligible script: the characters speak English, but can someone understand the lines? It's porridge, it means nothing, it's surrealist just to be surrealist and worst, it's not even funny or moving! The aunt is stupid like the sister and brother in law, the mother talks too much for nothing, the father is a video addict! Holly seemed cute, fragile at first but at the end, she didn't do much! In addition, the soundtrack with a lot of bad songs is just irritating and Jodie is there a poor director: all the opening credit is about a painting that we don't see! She zooms in Holly (1,57m) and McDermott (1,83m) so we have only the head of the first and the second has his forehead cut! The only interesting thing is the unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr, so puffy that he looked like a Javier Bardem. Finally, i thought after watching "Always", that Holly was a fine actress but after having watched this crap, stupid "Crash" and her horrible TV show, i really wonder....

Henry (played by Charles Durning) is a retired airport worker who is called Tubby by his wife and who is simply happy to see his daughter. The drive home and the day before Thanksgiving are fairly uneventful. The occasion itself, anything but. This is a great movie. There is an obvious difference between "holiday movies" and movies that simply take place during the holidays. While A Christmas Story and the Home Alone series would be the former, Millions, another favorite of mine, and Home for the Holidays would be the latter. Members of the family just don't get along; the holiday itself is more nightmarish than heartwarming and, in spite of that, there is still a tearful goodbye as the family departs at the conclusion of the festivities. This is a movie you can, and should, watch year-round.

    The editing focuses on the actors plying their crafts. The actors soar because the writing soars. Well, there may have been other factors contributing to Downey's soaring. And the film flies because the story has a fine, cantilevered arc. If you enjoy fine theater, you'll love this flick. It's interesting: Hollywood pushes a fairly constricted idea of film. I'm not saying Hollywood stinks; it's just important not to think that's all film can be. And "Home for the Holidays" is a fine way to take a break from Hollywood. Give yourself that break; you deserve it. I really don't want to say anything about content. There's so much to recommend the flick, starting with the perfect writing, that it feels like it could almost have any content and somehow be wonderful.

    Entirely appropriate for Thanksgiving because this has got to be one of the worst turkeys ever made. Characters, dialog, music...it's all a train wreck. Billed as a comedy, it lacks that quality of humor the ancient Greeks called "being funny." Or even remotely so. I'm not of the school that has to like characters, though it's helpful. But if they're not likable, there should be something interesting, something that provokes thought, incites something beyond a mere "Eeeuw!" reaction. Not sure where we obtained this DVD, who inflicted it upon us. We made it about half way through.I haven't written a review in quite a while but I logged on just to add a "Beware, turn away while you still have time" notice.

    This move was about two self-centered self-indulgent family members who could care less about whether they are making the rest of their family miserable. Sure the family may not be the Brady Bunch but whose is? And some movies manage to be humorous about that but not this one. Claudia and her brother were just mean spirited, not funny. Can't believe Jodie Foster was involved in this. The performances and production are good. I haven't watched it since reading that Downey was on drugs but I didn't notice at the time. Essentially I think this movie missed the mark of holiday movies that poke fun at dysfunctional families with the idea that we all have them but love them. I couldn't stand the two main characters. I felt sorry for the sister.

    I was drawn by the impressive array of actors that was brought together. It sounded like it couldn't miss, and a comedy of a family struggling through a hectic Thanksgiving is usually an tried and true formula. So how did the talent here manage to botch the job? I think the main culprit is the script. The people who populate this film are not believable people, but cut-out stereotypes from a sitcom writer in a hurry to get a paycheck. In addition, all of the characters are so exasperating, I found myself hoping that a meteor would land on the dining room. The humor is so abrasive and the slapstick is so noisy, I couldn't laugh if I wanted to. A lot of the humor is derisive and mean-spirited, like a WASP version of an Andrew Dice Clay Thanksgiving. Then the film tries to cover it up by going all lovey-dovey during the final reels and risked the health of viewers with bad teeth. I will say this much in the film's favor- the actors do the best they can with the material it's given. There are some quiet scenes that work well and I wish there had been more of them. The film is bad, but it could have been even worse. I would rate it barely tolerable.

    Holly Hunter stars as a woman who finds out she's not quite making it just before she heads home to Baltimore for Thanksgiving, where an overbearing mother, slightly whacked-out father are waiting for their children to return home to the nest, including her homosexual brother who's very well known for his antics and escapades. I'm not sure where to begin, except that the genres for this film are seriously backwards. Don't get me wrong...I like the movie, but I found more drama than comedy in it. And there's that old saying about, "Look in the dictionary under (insert word here) and you'll find my family picture as the illustration," and dysfunctional is DEFINITELY Hunter's family in this case. It's not stupid comedy, and it's not a stupid movie, but it's not really that funny, either. 3 out of 10 stars.

    This movie is so great - totally under-rated. I love to watch it every year around Thanksgiving or Christmas. Watching this movie always reminds me of how families are - the different dynamics between family members. On top of that, it makes me laugh throughout the film every time. The cast of this film is great and it is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again. So give this movie a chance - you will laugh, you will feel happy, there will be peace on earth, and everyone will walk around and give each other hugs and say "see, your family is pretty normal."

    A script lacking dramatic weight and humorous bite, along with characters that are just too 'off centre', mean that Jodie Foster's second outing as director is not a terribly memorable one. Holly Hunter, always an enjoyable screen presence, impresses as Claudia Larson, a single mother who finds herself making yet another annual flight to celebrate thanksgiving with her painful family. All this on top of losing her job and discovering that her sixteen year old daughter is about to begin having sexual relations with her boyfriend. Life sucks sometimes! Unfortunately Holly's character is really the only one the audience is going to be able to relate to, or even stomach for that matter. Anne Bancroft's mom is a nightmare of paranoia, dad (Charles Durning) is a nostalgic, rotund old fool who is quite possibly losing his grip, while sister and brother-in-law (Cynthia Stevenson and Steve Guttenberg) are obnoxious and self-centred. Add to this a nutty Aunt (Geraldine Chaplin) and a totally flaky and intensely irritating homosexual brother (a most unlikeable Robert Downey Jnr.) and you find it very hard to feel sympathy for, get involved with, or laugh at any of this sorry lot. The screenplay swings from drama to comedy to romance to tragedy on many occasions, but Foster is unable to gain effect in any of these modes. In the end neither cast nor crew can pick up the pieces of what was really a misdirected project to begin with. My advice......don't bother going "Home for the Holidays." Saturday, May 25, 1996 - Capitol Cinema, Melbourne

    I came to this movie just this year (2007) on broadcast TV, sleepless, facing my first Thanksgiving after my own Mother's death, with the added gift of NO ONE in my family speaking to each other, NO ONE coming for Thanksgiving. I thought I'd watch a bit of fluff as a kind of perverse combination 'sneer-fest' and pity party. You know, thinking: "Oh yeah, Jodie Foster? Why don't you just show us all a bit of holiday family snarky 'everybody-feels-great-underneath-no-really-they do' barf, okay? Like you, like anyone, would know how cruel, petty, mean and heartbreakingly real families are- and how much we, how much I, need them." So, now I own it. And tonight, after a Thanksgiving and a Christmas where everyone really did stay away from each other, I watched it again. I can't add to the well thought out and well written reviews of the movie here (yes, Robert Downey, my favorite actor, is brilliant, Holly Hunter, another favorite, is breaking my heart; Anne Bancroft a goddess, also breaks my heart and Charles Durning, light on his feet in so many ways, showing just a bit of what he can do) - heck all the actors are on point perfectly, but that's not my reason for writing. Here is: Tonight I listened to Jodie Foster's voice-over and I hear her trying to help us understand why the movie wasn't well received. Jodie, if it wasn't well-received then, it is now. This one's on my shelf forever. Thank you. I hope you know what a brilliant, real, take-no-prisoners, warm the cockles of my jaded heart (my other perennial holiday movies are Jaws, Aliens and Terminator 2, maybe The Ref) movie you've made. Just for me. My Christmas present. Thank you.
