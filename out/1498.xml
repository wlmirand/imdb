 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A career criminal's son (Field) tries to prove to his father (Gazzara) that he can handle the family biz. The father, Farmer, doubts this but gives his son a chance, and takes him under his wing. Meanwhile the son, Chase, starts glorifying exploits to his girlfriend (Boyle). The father learns of this and tells his son not to see her anymore. Chase goes against his father's wishes and continues to see Hillary, the girlfriend. Problems of course arise between the three only to be heightened once the FBI gets on Farmer's trail.
