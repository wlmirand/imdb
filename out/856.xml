    Jim Jarmusch does a great job with vignettes, as we've seen in "Mystery Train" and "Coffee and Cigarettes." Here he unites the world with the same incident -- someone taking a cab -- but different experiences in different cultures. Gena Rowlands is a casting agent landing in LA and being picked up by an offbeat taxi driver (Winona Ryder); Armin Muller-Stahl is an ex-German clown driving a cab in New York who picks up Giancarlo Esposito (who ends up driving) and later Rosie Perez; Isaach DeBankole is a taxi driver in Paris who throws three idiots out of his cab and picks up a blind girl (Beatrice Dalle); Roberto Begnini is a taxi driver in Rome who confesses all kinds of sex acts to the bishop he's driving (Paolo Bonacelli); and Matti Pelonpaa is a cab driver in Helsinki who tells his sad story to his passengers. Each vignette is wonderful and indicative of the country in which the characters reside. My favorite is the New York City sequence, which is out and out hysterical, with Armin Muller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez, all of whom are fabulous. And if you ever lived in New York, you can relate to the difficulty in getting a cab that will take you to the boroughs, especially late at night - it was all so typical, as the scenes in the other countries probably were as well. I would have to put what is practically a monologue by Roberto Begnini next. It's definitely the most absurd as he confesses the grossest things to the overwhelmed bishop. Very black comedy. If I have a least favorite, it's the first one, as it was fairly predictable and Winona Ryder as a taxi driver with aspirations to be a mechanic was unconvincing. Gena Rowlands, however, looked gorgeous and has an in joke while on the phone: "I'm supposed to have dinner with Shera and Peter tonight," meaning Shera Danese and Peter Falk, best friends of the Cassavetes. In "Mystery Train," Jarmusch shows people visiting Sun Records and ties them all together with one incident, and we see what each character is doing at the time it happens. Very clever. Here, the thing that unites these characters is a cab ride. Very, very enjoyable, with lively characterizations, beautifully directed. Jarmusch is a quirky talent but a great one nonetheless.

    Night on Earth is a beautiful movie in all it's simplicity. In the center of the movie are the encounters of people, who maybe wouldn't meet otherwise, but in a taxi cab they get a connection to each other - or to themselves. The movie is a mixture of drama and black comedy (especially Roberto Benigni's character is unbelievably funny!) that carries through the movie. It consists of five quite different episodes located in different cities of the world. Although the main idea is quite simple, after seeing this movie you have a feeling that you have in some level at least learned or remembered something important about the world and human beings.

    The nights in the big cities have their very own mysterious and incomparable aura. Only the cab drivers who are circling the blocks after midnight and pick up ever changing passengers really have a sense of such a feeling, that strange kind of reality that engulfs them when everyone else is sleeping. You get a glimpse of the dark side of the aura if you follow De Niro's Travis Bickle in "Taxi Driver", and for the rest feel free to join independent film-maker Jim Jarmusch on five rides through L.A., New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki and see what the night has to offer. Writer/director Jarmusch celebrates the synchrony of events happening in various cabs all over the globe, where drama, fun and tragedy all take place at the same time while the earth takes another turn around its axis. All shot on location of the actual cities this episodic masterpiece was photographed excellently, there are some wonderful performances, lots of poignant moments and hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy. Armin M&uuml;ller-Stahl for example as German ex-clown "Helmet" going to "Brookland" clashing with NY culture is side-splittingly funny right from his greeting "Hello! How are YOU?" Then of course there is Roberto Benigni's wild confessional ride through Rome with a padre on the back seat, which has become an instant classic. Incredibly touching is also the final chapter in Helsinki with some drunkards exchanging tragic stories only to arrive at sunrise to catch some sleep. Or the one with the black cabbie, who learns to respect a blind woman and makes one wonder: Who's really the blind one? OK, OK, with all those overwhelmingly brilliant snapshots there's one obvious downside - which is the first tale, starring Wyona Rider as a small, but tough cookie: "I want to become a mechanic!" But after all taxi driving wasn't for her and she did eventually become an actress, didn't she?

    Jim Jarmusch directs five distinct taxi rides from different cities around the world. The first is set in Los Angeles with Wynona Ryder as the driver and Gena Rowland's as a Hollywood exec looking for an actress for role in a film. She feels that Ryder would be perfect for it so Ryder must make that decision. The second ride is in New York City with a German immigrant who picks up Yo Yo and his sister in law, Rosie Perez and they show him the highlights of Brooklyn. Number three is in Paris with a blind French passenger being driven by an African driver. They try to communicate but there is a big language and cultural barrier. Number four is in Rome with the cabbie picking up a priest and confessing all kinds of crazy sexual sins. This is the funniest segment of the bunch. The fifth and final one in set in Helsinki. Three drunken passengers who have been laid off from their jobs take a ride and describe their problems to the driver. Night on Earth is a charming vignette with music by Tom Waits.

    Few directors enjoy the cult status that Jarmusch does. Sadly, he is praised undeservedly, this film is not ingenious. So why do people praise him so much? The answer may appear at the conclusion of this review. The film's plot revolves around five taxi rides around the world, at night. They take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki. The way the movie is filmed is unambitious, the camera is placed in the taxi, the driver in the front seat (to the right of the screen), the passenger in the back seat (to the left of the screen). Technically (camera placement, cinematography, lighting etc) Jarmusch doesn't offer us anything new, so people shouldn't praise him for this. The worst part about this movie is the plot. Jarmusch shows us long and boring monologues, uninteresting dialogue and a very weak plot. This is why no studio will ever finance him. Oh, but he's proud of that, isn't he? The way people talk, and what they say is very boring. Even if you have a great actor playing the part, and saying the lines in a very interesting way, this doesn't make you interested. Imagine Morgan Freeman, or David Letterman saying "We're out of milk". Even if they do say it in a way which is most accurately described as awesome, you're still not interested. The great Kurosawa said "Though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a good script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a bad script". Jarmusch wrote this script in eight days. Jarmusch wrote a very bad script. You can say, "but this is how people talk in real life". If we were more entertained by real life than by movies, the movie industry would cease to exist. The reason we watch movies is to see something that we don't see everyday. Showing me something "real", something I can see everyday bores me. He isn't just showing people the way they talk in real life, he is showing us real life. He might as well have turned the camera on in a cab, and made a movie out of it. Writing a script in eight days is not impressive, it's insulting, he didn't put enough effort into it and it ends up sucking. If you are making a movie, put more effort into the script, because people watch movies. People deserve better, especially if they are paying to see the movie. Nothing happens in this movie, I'm serious, it's just people talking in a cab! That's it, nothing more! Jarmusch has said that he would rather make a movie about a man walking his dog, than a movie about the emperor of China. Does he LOVE emptiness in a movie? Does he LOVE a movie that has no story, or a very weak one? He is the biggest enemy of all fiction, he hates a good story, and he loves a bad one. He loves boring things. The most interesting thing about Jarmusch is his hair. The script is the major fault in this movie, because of the bad script the movie is terrible. The film has some good acting, I guess. Nothing memorable, though. Roberto Benigni is a great actor and director, see "A beautiful Life". Winona Rider is also respectable. The person who plays the Norwegian cab driver is very good, and his monologue, I will admit, is well written. It's not the imagery we see in Bergman's "Persona", a film which contains the single best monologue in history, but it's good. Jarmusch probably worked a whole day on it. The music in the film is not consistent with the tone. People talking in a cab at night is not Jazz. It's not The Blues. It's just people talking in a cab. Jarmusch put it in, probably because he likes Jazz, that's it. Why people like him still alludes me, but I'll give it a shot. It's because they don't want to like what everybody else likes. They want to be unique. They want to see independent film making, they probably also like Indy rock. It's OK to like something, but to wrongly preach about how great it is, when it's really just boring, and act as if you are better than people who don't like this film for a reason, that's wrong. I don't like this film for the reasons above, why you like it, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get Jarmusch.

    I can't believe that IMDb watchers rated this a 7.7 stars, they must've been high on some kind of serious drugs or something! Five pointless stories about five foreign cabdrivers. This film makes you think that something is going to happen around the next turn but nothing does, no cool twists or anything funny just boring stories that made my girlfriend fall asleep. The first two stories were better than the last three. The boring story with Winona Ryder was probably the best, this was one of her first films and must not have read the script very well. She must have needed some money real bad to decide to do this horrible movie. Get ready to put your ear plugs in when you see Rosie Perez coming with her annoying shrieking voice of darkness! This scene was really annoying even the drunks in the ghetto wanted to tell her to shut up. I was hoping that each story might have some type of twist coming into the plot, but they never did and I was very surprised I watched the last two stories, they just got worse as they went along. The last three of them are even captioned, you actually have to take the extra energy to read the words, so really!!!  Don't bother with this movie, it really sucked. Absolutely pointless, none of them had any substance.

    Night on Earth is an odd little film from an odd little director named Jim Jarmush. I'm a fan of Jarmush's style in writing and directing and he really tries to shine through this film. It tells five different stories about five taxi cab drivers in four different countries in one night. Each story is very different and none of them really begin or end. It is really five snippets of the strange occurrences which happen between us at night. The stories take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. The film is very loose and very odd, making it interesting yet sometimes hard to really become devoted to. There is no real connection, blatant, or metaphoric, between the five stories. They all seem to be in their own little worlds simply documenting the happenings that go on late at night in taxi cabs. It could be argued that the films only goal is to document these melancholy little tales, not having any other motives and not trying to be any more than an anthology of stories. From this perspective the film just ends up being pretty dull when you look at it as a whole. Each story in its own right is fairly entertaining and it can be plenty amusing, but anything and everything that happens in this film ultimately amounts to nothing. The film really goes nowhere and doesn't seem to accomplish anything. But again, maybe it isn't trying to. Maybe it is simply just a portrait of the quiet night life that occurs in 4:00 AM taxi cabs. The only thing that is certain is that Jarmush has taken some playful liberties with the storytelling medium and has created a film that is very different. Once you get past the fact that Night on Earth really isn't trying to do anything amazing, you can appreciate it a lot more for the good things about it. Jarmush's script is great and he writes witty banter excellently. There is little to no action in the film. It is all about the dialogue as the actors sit in their taxi cabs and discuss life, death, and everything else. Luckily, the dialogue is the most engaging thing about the film when it needs to be. It is that and the great acting by all the performers. None of the five stories fall flat from an acting standpoint and they only grow more and more interesting until the last story which takes place in Helsinki which is most definitely the most enthralling. There are plenty of great things going for this film, I'm just not sure what any of it is supposed to mean and what purpose anything in this movie serves. Better yet, I don't know that this movie has a purpose. Regardless, Jarmush has made a very interesting film with Night on Earth it is intelligent and almost always entertaining. There's nothing here to make me dislike the film but at the same time that is the problem. There isn't much here so I can't love it either. All in all it is a film of high quality and class, but at the same time it feels a little empty because of no real connection or leading element to fuel the film. Night on Earth is a good film, but it is really nothing more than five separate short stories with no real beginning and no real end.

    That's the first word which comes to me just after seeing the movie : delightful. Jarmusch shows what life is or should be : a succession of sweet funny/essential moments made of chance encounters which could happen everywhere, at any time, even in a cab with somebody you don't know at all. Maybe we are just too blind to see/feel these moments as special as they are though. Moreover, Night on Earth is really funny. A sharp sense of humor. With a tremendous Roberto Benigni making conversation to a priest, speaking alone about pumpkins or sheep. With the so impassive Isaach De Bankol&eacute;, trying to understand how a blind person could live, before realizing they see better than the sighted. After seeing this movie, you strangely want to become a cab-driver in a big city somewhere...

    This is a film that is strictly about character. Or should I say characters? A set of five little twenty minute films, set in and around taxi cabs, allowing the characters to interact and expose their loves and their fears, their baggage and their hopes. Each is strong or weak in its own way. The first, with Winona Ryder is, to me, the weakest, although I couldn't take my eyes off her. There is subtlety and a delicate touch to all of them. My favorite was the Finnish one. The most contrived and least human was the Italian one with Roberto Benigni. While it was outrageous, it was a long running gag, a kind of cruel joke. In the other the four, the people were interesting and accessible. Their lives were realistic and, in some ways, cruel, yet their stories moved us. All things considered, it is a unique idea and has enough to recommend it. Also, there's the music of Tom Waits. What more could you want.

    This is only the second(the other being Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai) film by Jarmusch I watch, even though my interest in him has been growing for a while. If you've been exposed to anything by him or at least heard about it, you know that he's not mainstream. He makes movies comparable to short stories(not necessarily the most recent brand of such, those get to be all about your own interpretation, and are very vague). Slices of life. This visits five different cities around the world(New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Helsinki), and thus contains four different languages(!), as three of these places are in Europe. Different classes and types of people meet, as each time we go to a new place, we follow a cabbie and his fare(sometimes plural), all in this one night, possibly starting at the same time. There is no overarching plot connecting them all; what makes them similar is that they're all human beings with a history and personalities. The realism is high, if there are oddities. Not all the characters are likable(and there are stereotypes among them), but they tend to be interesting and credible(flawed, *real*), same as their backgrounds. The acting is great, with some performances being downright excellent. This is carried by the dialog, what is said(and in what way), and what isn't. Other than establishing shots of the 5 places(that are not all alike, going right from a metropolis to something you could almost call quaint), most of what we see are the drivers and the passengers, there are no flashbacks and occurrences are largely retold, not seen. The editing and cinematography are subtle; the focus here is on the content, not the form. There is also hardly any music, other than the main theme, which has variations on it for where on Earth we are(and in what culture) when we hear it, so to speak. The majority of the humor is discreet, as well, with the obvious exception of Benigni(and arguably the NY segment). There is plenty of swearing, a bit of sexuality in the lines and a little disgusting content in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes pictures like these. 8/10

He might as well have turned the camera on in a cab, and made a movie out of it. Writing a script in eight days is not impressive, it's insulting, he didn't put enough effort into it and it ends up sucking. If you are making a movie, put more effort into the script, because people watch movies. People deserve better, especially if they are paying to see the movie. Nothing happens in this movie, I'm serious, it's just people talking in a cab! That's it, nothing more! Jarmusch has said that he would rather make a movie about a man walking his dog, than a movie about the emperor of China. Does he LOVE emptiness in a movie? Does he LOVE a movie that has no story, or a very weak one? He is the biggest enemy of all fiction, he hates a good story, and he loves a bad one. He loves boring things. The most interesting thing about Jarmusch is his hair. The script is the major fault in this movie, because of the bad script the movie is terrible. The film has some good acting, I guess. Nothing memorable, though. Roberto Benigni is a great actor and director, see "A beautiful Life". Winona Rider is also respectable. The person who plays the Norwegian cab driver is very good, and his monologue, I will admit, is well written. It's not the imagery we see in Bergman's "Persona", a film which contains the single best monologue in history, but it's good. Jarmusch probably worked a whole day on it. The music in the film is not consistent with the tone. People talking in a cab at night is not Jazz. It's not The Blues. It's just people talking in a cab. Jarmusch put it in, probably because he likes Jazz, that's it. Why people like him still alludes me, but I'll give it a shot. It's because they don't want to like what everybody else likes. They want to be unique. They want to see independent film making, they probably also like Indy rock. It's OK to like something, but to wrongly preach about how great it is, when it's really just boring, and act as if you are better than people who don't like this film for a reason, that's wrong. I don't like this film for the reasons above, why you like it, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get Jarmusch.

    I can't believe that IMDb watchers rated this a 7.7 stars, they must've been high on some kind of serious drugs or something! Five pointless stories about five foreign cabdrivers. This film makes you think that something is going to happen around the next turn but nothing does, no cool twists or anything funny just boring stories that made my girlfriend fall asleep. The first two stories were better than the last three. The boring story with Winona Ryder was probably the best, this was one of her first films and must not have read the script very well. She must have needed some money real bad to decide to do this horrible movie. Get ready to put your ear plugs in when you see Rosie Perez coming with her annoying shrieking voice of darkness! This scene was really annoying even the drunks in the ghetto wanted to tell her to shut up. I was hoping that each story might have some type of twist coming into the plot, but they never did and I was very surprised I watched the last two stories, they just got worse as they went along. The last three of them are even captioned, you actually have to take the extra energy to read the words, so really!!!  Don't bother with this movie, it really sucked. Absolutely pointless, none of them had any substance.

    Night on Earth is an odd little film from an odd little director named Jim Jarmush. I'm a fan of Jarmush's style in writing and directing and he really tries to shine through this film. It tells five different stories about five taxi cab drivers in four different countries in one night. Each story is very different and none of them really begin or end. It is really five snippets of the strange occurrences which happen between us at night. The stories take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. The film is very loose and very odd, making it interesting yet sometimes hard to really become devoted to. There is no real connection, blatant, or metaphoric, between the five stories. They all seem to be in their own little worlds simply documenting the happenings that go on late at night in taxi cabs. It could be argued that the films only goal is to document these melancholy little tales, not having any other motives and not trying to be any more than an anthology of stories. From this perspective the film just ends up being pretty dull when you look at it as a whole. Each story in its own right is fairly entertaining and it can be plenty amusing, but anything and everything that happens in this film ultimately amounts to nothing. The film really goes nowhere and doesn't seem to accomplish anything. But again, maybe it isn't trying to. Maybe it is simply just a portrait of the quiet night life that occurs in 4:00 AM taxi cabs. The only thing that is certain is that Jarmush has taken some playful liberties with the storytelling medium and has created a film that is very different. Once you get past the fact that Night on Earth really isn't trying to do anything amazing, you can appreciate it a lot more for the good things about it. Jarmush's script is great and he writes witty banter excellently. There is little to no action in the film. It is all about the dialogue as the actors sit in their taxi cabs and discuss life, death, and everything else. Luckily, the dialogue is the most engaging thing about the film when it needs to be. It is that and the great acting by all the performers. None of the five stories fall flat from an acting standpoint and they only grow more and more interesting until the last story which takes place in Helsinki which is most definitely the most enthralling. There are plenty of great things going for this film, I'm just not sure what any of it is supposed to mean and what purpose anything in this movie serves. Better yet, I don't know that this movie has a purpose. Regardless, Jarmush has made a very interesting film with Night on Earth it is intelligent and almost always entertaining. There's nothing here to make me dislike the film but at the same time that is the problem. There isn't much here so I can't love it either. All in all it is a film of high quality and class, but at the same time it feels a little empty because of no real connection or leading element to fuel the film. Night on Earth is a good film, but it is really nothing more than five separate short stories with no real beginning and no real end.

    That's the first word which comes to me just after seeing the movie : delightful. Jarmusch shows what life is or should be : a succession of sweet funny/essential moments made of chance encounters which could happen everywhere, at any time, even in a cab with somebody you don't know at all. Maybe we are just too blind to see/feel these moments as special as they are though. Moreover, Night on Earth is really funny. A sharp sense of humor. With a tremendous Roberto Benigni making conversation to a priest, speaking alone about pumpkins or sheep. With the so impassive Isaach De Bankol&eacute;, trying to understand how a blind person could live, before realizing they see better than the sighted. After seeing this movie, you strangely want to become a cab-driver in a big city somewhere...

    This is a film that is strictly about character. Or should I say characters? A set of five little twenty minute films, set in and around taxi cabs, allowing the characters to interact and expose their loves and their fears, their baggage and their hopes. Each is strong or weak in its own way. The first, with Winona Ryder is, to me, the weakest, although I couldn't take my eyes off her. There is subtlety and a delicate touch to all of them. My favorite was the Finnish one. The most contrived and least human was the Italian one with Roberto Benigni. While it was outrageous, it was a long running gag, a kind of cruel joke. In the other the four, the people were interesting and accessible. Their lives were realistic and, in some ways, cruel, yet their stories moved us. All things considered, it is a unique idea and has enough to recommend it. Also, there's the music of Tom Waits. What more could you want.

    This is only the second(the other being Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai) film by Jarmusch I watch, even though my interest in him has been growing for a while. If you've been exposed to anything by him or at least heard about it, you know that he's not mainstream. He makes movies comparable to short stories(not necessarily the most recent brand of such, those get to be all about your own interpretation, and are very vague). Slices of life. This visits five different cities around the world(New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Helsinki), and thus contains four different languages(!), as three of these places are in Europe. Different classes and types of people meet, as each time we go to a new place, we follow a cabbie and his fare(sometimes plural), all in this one night, possibly starting at the same time. There is no overarching plot connecting them all; what makes them similar is that they're all human beings with a history and personalities. The realism is high, if there are oddities. Not all the characters are likable(and there are stereotypes among them), but they tend to be interesting and credible(flawed, *real*), same as their backgrounds. The acting is great, with some performances being downright excellent. This is carried by the dialog, what is said(and in what way), and what isn't. Other than establishing shots of the 5 places(that are not all alike, going right from a metropolis to something you could almost call quaint), most of what we see are the drivers and the passengers, there are no flashbacks and occurrences are largely retold, not seen. The editing and cinematography are subtle; the focus here is on the content, not the form. There is also hardly any music, other than the main theme, which has variations on it for where on Earth we are(and in what culture) when we hear it, so to speak. The majority of the humor is discreet, as well, with the obvious exception of Benigni(and arguably the NY segment). There is plenty of swearing, a bit of sexuality in the lines and a little disgusting content in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes pictures like these. 8/10

    Jim Jarmusch does a great job with vignettes, as we've seen in "Mystery Train" and "Coffee and Cigarettes." Here he unites the world with the same incident -- someone taking a cab -- but different experiences in different cultures. Gena Rowlands is a casting agent landing in LA and being picked up by an offbeat taxi driver (Winona Ryder); Armin Muller-Stahl is an ex-German clown driving a cab in New York who picks up Giancarlo Esposito (who ends up driving) and later Rosie Perez; Isaach DeBankole is a taxi driver in Paris who throws three idiots out of his cab and picks up a blind girl (Beatrice Dalle); Roberto Begnini is a taxi driver in Rome who confesses all kinds of sex acts to the bishop he's driving (Paolo Bonacelli); and Matti Pelonpaa is a cab driver in Helsinki who tells his sad story to his passengers. Each vignette is wonderful and indicative of the country in which the characters reside. My favorite is the New York City sequence, which is out and out hysterical, with Armin Muller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez, all of whom are fabulous. And if you ever lived in New York, you can relate to the difficulty in getting a cab that will take you to the boroughs, especially late at night - it was all so typical, as the scenes in the other countries probably were as well. I would have to put what is practically a monologue by Roberto Begnini next. It's definitely the most absurd as he confesses the grossest things to the overwhelmed bishop. Very black comedy. If I have a least favorite, it's the first one, as it was fairly predictable and Winona Ryder as a taxi driver with aspirations to be a mechanic was unconvincing. Gena Rowlands, however, looked gorgeous and has an in joke while on the phone: "I'm supposed to have dinner with Shera and Peter tonight," meaning Shera Danese and Peter Falk, best friends of the Cassavetes. In "Mystery Train," Jarmusch shows people visiting Sun Records and ties them all together with one incident, and we see what each character is doing at the time it happens. Very clever. Here, the thing that unites these characters is a cab ride. Very, very enjoyable, with lively characterizations, beautifully directed. Jarmusch is a quirky talent but a great one nonetheless.

    Night on Earth is a beautiful movie in all it's simplicity. In the center of the movie are the encounters of people, who maybe wouldn't meet otherwise, but in a taxi cab they get a connection to each other - or to themselves. The movie is a mixture of drama and black comedy (especially Roberto Benigni's character is unbelievably funny!) that carries through the movie. It consists of five quite different episodes located in different cities of the world. Although the main idea is quite simple, after seeing this movie you have a feeling that you have in some level at least learned or remembered something important about the world and human beings.

    The nights in the big cities have their very own mysterious and incomparable aura. Only the cab drivers who are circling the blocks after midnight and pick up ever changing passengers really have a sense of such a feeling, that strange kind of reality that engulfs them when everyone else is sleeping. You get a glimpse of the dark side of the aura if you follow De Niro's Travis Bickle in "Taxi Driver", and for the rest feel free to join independent film-maker Jim Jarmusch on five rides through L.A., New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki and see what the night has to offer. Writer/director Jarmusch celebrates the synchrony of events happening in various cabs all over the globe, where drama, fun and tragedy all take place at the same time while the earth takes another turn around its axis. All shot on location of the actual cities this episodic masterpiece was photographed excellently, there are some wonderful performances, lots of poignant moments and hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy. Armin M&uuml;ller-Stahl for example as German ex-clown "Helmet" going to "Brookland" clashing with NY culture is side-splittingly funny right from his greeting "Hello! How are YOU?" Then of course there is Roberto Benigni's wild confessional ride through Rome with a padre on the back seat, which has become an instant classic. Incredibly touching is also the final chapter in Helsinki with some drunkards exchanging tragic stories only to arrive at sunrise to catch some sleep. Or the one with the black cabbie, who learns to respect a blind woman and makes one wonder: Who's really the blind one? OK, OK, with all those overwhelmingly brilliant snapshots there's one obvious downside - which is the first tale, starring Wyona Rider as a small, but tough cookie: "I want to become a mechanic!" But after all taxi driving wasn't for her and she did eventually become an actress, didn't she?

    Jim Jarmusch directs five distinct taxi rides from different cities around the world. The first is set in Los Angeles with Wynona Ryder as the driver and Gena Rowland's as a Hollywood exec looking for an actress for role in a film. She feels that Ryder would be perfect for it so Ryder must make that decision. The second ride is in New York City with a German immigrant who picks up Yo Yo and his sister in law, Rosie Perez and they show him the highlights of Brooklyn. Number three is in Paris with a blind French passenger being driven by an African driver. They try to communicate but there is a big language and cultural barrier. Number four is in Rome with the cabbie picking up a priest and confessing all kinds of crazy sexual sins. This is the funniest segment of the bunch. The fifth and final one in set in Helsinki. Three drunken passengers who have been laid off from their jobs take a ride and describe their problems to the driver. Night on Earth is a charming vignette with music by Tom Waits.

    Few directors enjoy the cult status that Jarmusch does. Sadly, he is praised undeservedly, this film is not ingenious. So why do people praise him so much? The answer may appear at the conclusion of this review. The film's plot revolves around five taxi rides around the world, at night. They take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki. The way the movie is filmed is unambitious, the camera is placed in the taxi, the driver in the front seat (to the right of the screen), the passenger in the back seat (to the left of the screen). Technically (camera placement, cinematography, lighting etc) Jarmusch doesn't offer us anything new, so people shouldn't praise him for this. The worst part about this movie is the plot. Jarmusch shows us long and boring monologues, uninteresting dialogue and a very weak plot. This is why no studio will ever finance him. Oh, but he's proud of that, isn't he? The way people talk, and what they say is very boring. Even if you have a great actor playing the part, and saying the lines in a very interesting way, this doesn't make you interested. Imagine Morgan Freeman, or David Letterman saying "We're out of milk". Even if they do say it in a way which is most accurately described as awesome, you're still not interested. The great Kurosawa said "Though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a good script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a bad script". Jarmusch wrote this script in eight days. Jarmusch wrote a very bad script. You can say, "but this is how people talk in real life". If we were more entertained by real life than by movies, the movie industry would cease to exist. The reason we watch movies is to see something that we don't see everyday. Showing me something "real", something I can see everyday bores me. He isn't just showing people the way they talk in real life, he is showing us real life. He might as well have turned the camera on in a cab, and made a movie out of it. Writing a script in eight days is not impressive, it's insulting, he didn't put enough effort into it and it ends up sucking. If you are making a movie, put more effort into the script, because people watch movies. People deserve better, especially if they are paying to see the movie.

I don't like this film for the reasons above, why you like it, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get Jarmusch.

Other than establishing shots of the 5 places(that are not all alike, going right from a metropolis to something you could almost call quaint), most of what we see are the drivers and the passengers, there are no flashbacks and occurrences are largely retold, not seen. The editing and cinematography are subtle; the focus here is on the content, not the form. There is also hardly any music, other than the main theme, which has variations on it for where on Earth we are(and in what culture) when we hear it, so to speak. The majority of the humor is discreet, as well, with the obvious exception of Benigni(and arguably the NY segment). There is plenty of swearing, a bit of sexuality in the lines and a little disgusting content in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes pictures like these. 8/10

    Jim Jarmusch does a great job with vignettes, as we've seen in "Mystery Train" and "Coffee and Cigarettes." Here he unites the world with the same incident -- someone taking a cab -- but different experiences in different cultures. Gena Rowlands is a casting agent landing in LA and being picked up by an offbeat taxi driver (Winona Ryder); Armin Muller-Stahl is an ex-German clown driving a cab in New York who picks up Giancarlo Esposito (who ends up driving) and later Rosie Perez; Isaach DeBankole is a taxi driver in Paris who throws three idiots out of his cab and picks up a blind girl (Beatrice Dalle); Roberto Begnini is a taxi driver in Rome who confesses all kinds of sex acts to the bishop he's driving (Paolo Bonacelli); and Matti Pelonpaa is a cab driver in Helsinki who tells his sad story to his passengers. Each vignette is wonderful and indicative of the country in which the characters reside. My favorite is the New York City sequence, which is out and out hysterical, with Armin Muller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez, all of whom are fabulous. And if you ever lived in New York, you can relate to the difficulty in getting a cab that will take you to the boroughs, especially late at night - it was all so typical, as the scenes in the other countries probably were as well. I would have to put what is practically a monologue by Roberto Begnini next. It's definitely the most absurd as he confesses the grossest things to the overwhelmed bishop. Very black comedy. If I have a least favorite, it's the first one, as it was fairly predictable and Winona Ryder as a taxi driver with aspirations to be a mechanic was unconvincing. Gena Rowlands, however, looked gorgeous and has an in joke while on the phone: "I'm supposed to have dinner with Shera and Peter tonight," meaning Shera Danese and Peter Falk, best friends of the Cassavetes. In "Mystery Train," Jarmusch shows people visiting Sun Records and ties them all together with one incident, and we see what each character is doing at the time it happens. Very clever. Here, the thing that unites these characters is a cab ride. Very, very enjoyable, with lively characterizations, beautifully directed. Jarmusch is a quirky talent but a great one nonetheless.

    Night on Earth is a beautiful movie in all it's simplicity. In the center of the movie are the encounters of people, who maybe wouldn't meet otherwise, but in a taxi cab they get a connection to each other - or to themselves. The movie is a mixture of drama and black comedy (especially Roberto Benigni's character is unbelievably funny!) that carries through the movie. It consists of five quite different episodes located in different cities of the world. Although the main idea is quite simple, after seeing this movie you have a feeling that you have in some level at least learned or remembered something important about the world and human beings.

    The nights in the big cities have their very own mysterious and incomparable aura. Only the cab drivers who are circling the blocks after midnight and pick up ever changing passengers really have a sense of such a feeling, that strange kind of reality that engulfs them when everyone else is sleeping. You get a glimpse of the dark side of the aura if you follow De Niro's Travis Bickle in "Taxi Driver", and for the rest feel free to join independent film-maker Jim Jarmusch on five rides through L.A., New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki and see what the night has to offer. Writer/director Jarmusch celebrates the synchrony of events happening in various cabs all over the globe, where drama, fun and tragedy all take place at the same time while the earth takes another turn around its axis. All shot on location of the actual cities this episodic masterpiece was photographed excellently, there are some wonderful performances, lots of poignant moments and hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy. Armin M&uuml;ller-Stahl for example as German ex-clown "Helmet" going to "Brookland" clashing with NY culture is side-splittingly funny right from his greeting "Hello! How are YOU?" Then of course there is Roberto Benigni's wild confessional ride through Rome with a padre on the back seat, which has become an instant classic. Incredibly touching is also the final chapter in Helsinki with some drunkards exchanging tragic stories only to arrive at sunrise to catch some sleep. Or the one with the black cabbie, who learns to respect a blind woman and makes one wonder: Who's really the blind one? OK, OK, with all those overwhelmingly brilliant snapshots there's one obvious downside - which is the first tale, starring Wyona Rider as a small, but tough cookie: "I want to become a mechanic!" But after all taxi driving wasn't for her and she did eventually become an actress, didn't she?

    Jim Jarmusch directs five distinct taxi rides from different cities around the world. The first is set in Los Angeles with Wynona Ryder as the driver and Gena Rowland's as a Hollywood exec looking for an actress for role in a film. She feels that Ryder would be perfect for it so Ryder must make that decision. The second ride is in New York City with a German immigrant who picks up Yo Yo and his sister in law, Rosie Perez and they show him the highlights of Brooklyn. Number three is in Paris with a blind French passenger being driven by an African driver. They try to communicate but there is a big language and cultural barrier. Number four is in Rome with the cabbie picking up a priest and confessing all kinds of crazy sexual sins. This is the funniest segment of the bunch. The fifth and final one in set in Helsinki. Three drunken passengers who have been laid off from their jobs take a ride and describe their problems to the driver. Night on Earth is a charming vignette with music by Tom Waits.

    Few directors enjoy the cult status that Jarmusch does. Sadly, he is praised undeservedly, this film is not ingenious. So why do people praise him so much? The answer may appear at the conclusion of this review. The film's plot revolves around five taxi rides around the world, at night. They take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki. The way the movie is filmed is unambitious, the camera is placed in the taxi, the driver in the front seat (to the right of the screen), the passenger in the back seat (to the left of the screen). Technically (camera placement, cinematography, lighting etc) Jarmusch doesn't offer us anything new, so people shouldn't praise him for this. The worst part about this movie is the plot. Jarmusch shows us long and boring monologues, uninteresting dialogue and a very weak plot. This is why no studio will ever finance him. Oh, but he's proud of that, isn't he? The way people talk, and what they say is very boring. Even if you have a great actor playing the part, and saying the lines in a very interesting way, this doesn't make you interested. Imagine Morgan Freeman, or David Letterman saying "We're out of milk". Even if they do say it in a way which is most accurately described as awesome, you're still not interested. The great Kurosawa said "Though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a good script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a bad script". Jarmusch wrote this script in eight days. Jarmusch wrote a very bad script. You can say, "but this is how people talk in real life". If we were more entertained by real life than by movies, the movie industry would cease to exist. The reason we watch movies is to see something that we don't see everyday. Showing me something "real", something I can see everyday bores me. He isn't just showing people the way they talk in real life, he is showing us real life. He might as well have turned the camera on in a cab, and made a movie out of it. Writing a script in eight days is not impressive, it's insulting, he didn't put enough effort into it and it ends up sucking. If you are making a movie, put more effort into the script, because people watch movies. People deserve better, especially if they are paying to see the movie. Nothing happens in this movie, I'm serious, it's just people talking in a cab! That's it, nothing more! Jarmusch has said that he would rather make a movie about a man walking his dog, than a movie about the emperor of China. Does he LOVE emptiness in a movie? Does he LOVE a movie that has no story, or a very weak one? He is the biggest enemy of all fiction, he hates a good story, and he loves a bad one. He loves boring things. The most interesting thing about Jarmusch is his hair. The script is the major fault in this movie, because of the bad script the movie is terrible. The film has some good acting, I guess. Nothing memorable, though. Roberto Benigni is a great actor and director, see "A beautiful Life". Winona Rider is also respectable. The person who plays the Norwegian cab driver is very good, and his monologue, I will admit, is well written. It's not the imagery we see in Bergman's "Persona", a film which contains the single best monologue in history, but it's good. Jarmusch probably worked a whole day on it. The music in the film is not consistent with the tone. People talking in a cab at night is not Jazz. It's not The Blues. It's just people talking in a cab. Jarmusch put it in, probably because he likes Jazz, that's it. Why people like him still alludes me, but I'll give it a shot. It's because they don't want to like what everybody else likes. They want to be unique. They want to see independent film making, they probably also like Indy rock. It's OK to like something, but to wrongly preach about how great it is, when it's really just boring, and act as if you are better than people who don't like this film for a reason, that's wrong. I don't like this film for the reasons above, why you like it, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get Jarmusch.

    I can't believe that IMDb watchers rated this a 7.7 stars, they must've been high on some kind of serious drugs or something! Five pointless stories about five foreign cabdrivers. This film makes you think that something is going to happen around the next turn but nothing does, no cool twists or anything funny just boring stories that made my girlfriend fall asleep. The first two stories were better than the last three. The boring story with Winona Ryder was probably the best, this was one of her first films and must not have read the script very well. She must have needed some money real bad to decide to do this horrible movie. Get ready to put your ear plugs in when you see Rosie Perez coming with her annoying shrieking voice of darkness! This scene was really annoying even the drunks in the ghetto wanted to tell her to shut up. I was hoping that each story might have some type of twist coming into the plot, but they never did and I was very surprised I watched the last two stories, they just got worse as they went along. The last three of them are even captioned, you actually have to take the extra energy to read the words, so really!!!  Don't bother with this movie, it really sucked. Absolutely pointless, none of them had any substance.

    Night on Earth is an odd little film from an odd little director named Jim Jarmush. I'm a fan of Jarmush's style in writing and directing and he really tries to shine through this film. It tells five different stories about five taxi cab drivers in four different countries in one night. Each story is very different and none of them really begin or end. It is really five snippets of the strange occurrences which happen between us at night. The stories take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. The film is very loose and very odd, making it interesting yet sometimes hard to really become devoted to. There is no real connection, blatant, or metaphoric, between the five stories. They all seem to be in their own little worlds simply documenting the happenings that go on late at night in taxi cabs. It could be argued that the films only goal is to document these melancholy little tales, not having any other motives and not trying to be any more than an anthology of stories. From this perspective the film just ends up being pretty dull when you look at it as a whole. Each story in its own right is fairly entertaining and it can be plenty amusing, but anything and everything that happens in this film ultimately amounts to nothing. The film really goes nowhere and doesn't seem to accomplish anything. But again, maybe it isn't trying to. Maybe it is simply just a portrait of the quiet night life that occurs in 4:00 AM taxi cabs. The only thing that is certain is that Jarmush has taken some playful liberties with the storytelling medium and has created a film that is very different. Once you get past the fact that Night on Earth really isn't trying to do anything amazing, you can appreciate it a lot more for the good things about it. Jarmush's script is great and he writes witty banter excellently. There is little to no action in the film. It is all about the dialogue as the actors sit in their taxi cabs and discuss life, death, and everything else. Luckily, the dialogue is the most engaging thing about the film when it needs to be. It is that and the great acting by all the performers. None of the five stories fall flat from an acting standpoint and they only grow more and more interesting until the last story which takes place in Helsinki which is most definitely the most enthralling. There are plenty of great things going for this film, I'm just not sure what any of it is supposed to mean and what purpose anything in this movie serves. Better yet, I don't know that this movie has a purpose. Regardless, Jarmush has made a very interesting film with Night on Earth it is intelligent and almost always entertaining. There's nothing here to make me dislike the film but at the same time that is the problem. There isn't much here so I can't love it either. All in all it is a film of high quality and class, but at the same time it feels a little empty because of no real connection or leading element to fuel the film. Night on Earth is a good film, but it is really nothing more than five separate short stories with no real beginning and no real end.

    That's the first word which comes to me just after seeing the movie : delightful. Jarmusch shows what life is or should be : a succession of sweet funny/essential moments made of chance encounters which could happen everywhere, at any time, even in a cab with somebody you don't know at all. Maybe we are just too blind to see/feel these moments as special as they are though. Moreover, Night on Earth is really funny. A sharp sense of humor. With a tremendous Roberto Benigni making conversation to a priest, speaking alone about pumpkins or sheep. With the so impassive Isaach De Bankol&eacute;, trying to understand how a blind person could live, before realizing they see better than the sighted. After seeing this movie, you strangely want to become a cab-driver in a big city somewhere...

    This is a film that is strictly about character. Or should I say characters? A set of five little twenty minute films, set in and around taxi cabs, allowing the characters to interact and expose their loves and their fears, their baggage and their hopes. Each is strong or weak in its own way. The first, with Winona Ryder is, to me, the weakest, although I couldn't take my eyes off her. There is subtlety and a delicate touch to all of them. My favorite was the Finnish one. The most contrived and least human was the Italian one with Roberto Benigni. While it was outrageous, it was a long running gag, a kind of cruel joke. In the other the four, the people were interesting and accessible. Their lives were realistic and, in some ways, cruel, yet their stories moved us. All things considered, it is a unique idea and has enough to recommend it. Also, there's the music of Tom Waits. What more could you want.

    This is only the second(the other being Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai) film by Jarmusch I watch, even though my interest in him has been growing for a while. If you've been exposed to anything by him or at least heard about it, you know that he's not mainstream. He makes movies comparable to short stories(not necessarily the most recent brand of such, those get to be all about your own interpretation, and are very vague). Slices of life. This visits five different cities around the world(New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Helsinki), and thus contains four different languages(!), as three of these places are in Europe. Different classes and types of people meet, as each time we go to a new place, we follow a cabbie and his fare(sometimes plural), all in this one night, possibly starting at the same time. There is no overarching plot connecting them all; what makes them similar is that they're all human beings with a history and personalities. The realism is high, if there are oddities. Not all the characters are likable(and there are stereotypes among them), but they tend to be interesting and credible(flawed, *real*), same as their backgrounds. The acting is great, with some performances being downright excellent. This is carried by the dialog, what is said(and in what way), and what isn't. Other than establishing shots of the 5 places(that are not all alike, going right from a metropolis to something you could almost call quaint), most of what we see are the drivers and the passengers, there are no flashbacks and occurrences are largely retold, not seen.

It's not the imagery we see in Bergman's "Persona", a film which contains the single best monologue in history, but it's good. Jarmusch probably worked a whole day on it. The music in the film is not consistent with the tone. People talking in a cab at night is not Jazz. It's not The Blues. It's just people talking in a cab. Jarmusch put it in, probably because he likes Jazz, that's it. Why people like him still alludes me, but I'll give it a shot. It's because they don't want to like what everybody else likes. They want to be unique. They want to see independent film making, they probably also like Indy rock. It's OK to like something, but to wrongly preach about how great it is, when it's really just boring, and act as if you are better than people who don't like this film for a reason, that's wrong. I don't like this film for the reasons above, why you like it, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get Jarmusch.

    I can't believe that IMDb watchers rated this a 7.7 stars, they must've been high on some kind of serious drugs or something! Five pointless stories about five foreign cabdrivers. This film makes you think that something is going to happen around the next turn but nothing does, no cool twists or anything funny just boring stories that made my girlfriend fall asleep. The first two stories were better than the last three. The boring story with Winona Ryder was probably the best, this was one of her first films and must not have read the script very well. She must have needed some money real bad to decide to do this horrible movie. Get ready to put your ear plugs in when you see Rosie Perez coming with her annoying shrieking voice of darkness! This scene was really annoying even the drunks in the ghetto wanted to tell her to shut up. I was hoping that each story might have some type of twist coming into the plot, but they never did and I was very surprised I watched the last two stories, they just got worse as they went along. The last three of them are even captioned, you actually have to take the extra energy to read the words, so really!!!  Don't bother with this movie, it really sucked. Absolutely pointless, none of them had any substance.

    Night on Earth is an odd little film from an odd little director named Jim Jarmush. I'm a fan of Jarmush's style in writing and directing and he really tries to shine through this film. It tells five different stories about five taxi cab drivers in four different countries in one night. Each story is very different and none of them really begin or end. It is really five snippets of the strange occurrences which happen between us at night. The stories take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. The film is very loose and very odd, making it interesting yet sometimes hard to really become devoted to. There is no real connection, blatant, or metaphoric, between the five stories. They all seem to be in their own little worlds simply documenting the happenings that go on late at night in taxi cabs. It could be argued that the films only goal is to document these melancholy little tales, not having any other motives and not trying to be any more than an anthology of stories. From this perspective the film just ends up being pretty dull when you look at it as a whole. Each story in its own right is fairly entertaining and it can be plenty amusing, but anything and everything that happens in this film ultimately amounts to nothing. The film really goes nowhere and doesn't seem to accomplish anything. But again, maybe it isn't trying to. Maybe it is simply just a portrait of the quiet night life that occurs in 4:00 AM taxi cabs. The only thing that is certain is that Jarmush has taken some playful liberties with the storytelling medium and has created a film that is very different. Once you get past the fact that Night on Earth really isn't trying to do anything amazing, you can appreciate it a lot more for the good things about it. Jarmush's script is great and he writes witty banter excellently. There is little to no action in the film. It is all about the dialogue as the actors sit in their taxi cabs and discuss life, death, and everything else. Luckily, the dialogue is the most engaging thing about the film when it needs to be. It is that and the great acting by all the performers. None of the five stories fall flat from an acting standpoint and they only grow more and more interesting until the last story which takes place in Helsinki which is most definitely the most enthralling. There are plenty of great things going for this film, I'm just not sure what any of it is supposed to mean and what purpose anything in this movie serves. Better yet, I don't know that this movie has a purpose. Regardless, Jarmush has made a very interesting film with Night on Earth it is intelligent and almost always entertaining. There's nothing here to make me dislike the film but at the same time that is the problem. There isn't much here so I can't love it either. All in all it is a film of high quality and class, but at the same time it feels a little empty because of no real connection or leading element to fuel the film. Night on Earth is a good film, but it is really nothing more than five separate short stories with no real beginning and no real end.

    That's the first word which comes to me just after seeing the movie : delightful. Jarmusch shows what life is or should be : a succession of sweet funny/essential moments made of chance encounters which could happen everywhere, at any time, even in a cab with somebody you don't know at all. Maybe we are just too blind to see/feel these moments as special as they are though. Moreover, Night on Earth is really funny. A sharp sense of humor. With a tremendous Roberto Benigni making conversation to a priest, speaking alone about pumpkins or sheep. With the so impassive Isaach De Bankol&eacute;, trying to understand how a blind person could live, before realizing they see better than the sighted. After seeing this movie, you strangely want to become a cab-driver in a big city somewhere...

    This is a film that is strictly about character. Or should I say characters? A set of five little twenty minute films, set in and around taxi cabs, allowing the characters to interact and expose their loves and their fears, their baggage and their hopes. Each is strong or weak in its own way. The first, with Winona Ryder is, to me, the weakest, although I couldn't take my eyes off her. There is subtlety and a delicate touch to all of them. My favorite was the Finnish one. The most contrived and least human was the Italian one with Roberto Benigni. While it was outrageous, it was a long running gag, a kind of cruel joke. In the other the four, the people were interesting and accessible. Their lives were realistic and, in some ways, cruel, yet their stories moved us. All things considered, it is a unique idea and has enough to recommend it. Also, there's the music of Tom Waits. What more could you want.

    This is only the second(the other being Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai) film by Jarmusch I watch, even though my interest in him has been growing for a while. If you've been exposed to anything by him or at least heard about it, you know that he's not mainstream. He makes movies comparable to short stories(not necessarily the most recent brand of such, those get to be all about your own interpretation, and are very vague). Slices of life. This visits five different cities around the world(New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Helsinki), and thus contains four different languages(!), as three of these places are in Europe. Different classes and types of people meet, as each time we go to a new place, we follow a cabbie and his fare(sometimes plural), all in this one night, possibly starting at the same time. There is no overarching plot connecting them all; what makes them similar is that they're all human beings with a history and personalities. The realism is high, if there are oddities. Not all the characters are likable(and there are stereotypes among them), but they tend to be interesting and credible(flawed, *real*), same as their backgrounds. The acting is great, with some performances being downright excellent. This is carried by the dialog, what is said(and in what way), and what isn't. Other than establishing shots of the 5 places(that are not all alike, going right from a metropolis to something you could almost call quaint), most of what we see are the drivers and the passengers, there are no flashbacks and occurrences are largely retold, not seen. The editing and cinematography are subtle; the focus here is on the content, not the form. There is also hardly any music, other than the main theme, which has variations on it for where on Earth we are(and in what culture) when we hear it, so to speak. The majority of the humor is discreet, as well, with the obvious exception of Benigni(and arguably the NY segment). There is plenty of swearing, a bit of sexuality in the lines and a little disgusting content in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes pictures like these. 8/10

    Jim Jarmusch does a great job with vignettes, as we've seen in "Mystery Train" and "Coffee and Cigarettes." Here he unites the world with the same incident -- someone taking a cab -- but different experiences in different cultures. Gena Rowlands is a casting agent landing in LA and being picked up by an offbeat taxi driver (Winona Ryder); Armin Muller-Stahl is an ex-German clown driving a cab in New York who picks up Giancarlo Esposito (who ends up driving) and later Rosie Perez; Isaach DeBankole is a taxi driver in Paris who throws three idiots out of his cab and picks up a blind girl (Beatrice Dalle); Roberto Begnini is a taxi driver in Rome who confesses all kinds of sex acts to the bishop he's driving (Paolo Bonacelli); and Matti Pelonpaa is a cab driver in Helsinki who tells his sad story to his passengers. Each vignette is wonderful and indicative of the country in which the characters reside. My favorite is the New York City sequence, which is out and out hysterical, with Armin Muller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez, all of whom are fabulous. And if you ever lived in New York, you can relate to the difficulty in getting a cab that will take you to the boroughs, especially late at night - it was all so typical, as the scenes in the other countries probably were as well. I would have to put what is practically a monologue by Roberto Begnini next. It's definitely the most absurd as he confesses the grossest things to the overwhelmed bishop. Very black comedy. If I have a least favorite, it's the first one, as it was fairly predictable and Winona Ryder as a taxi driver with aspirations to be a mechanic was unconvincing. Gena Rowlands, however, looked gorgeous and has an in joke while on the phone: "I'm supposed to have dinner with Shera and Peter tonight," meaning Shera Danese and Peter Falk, best friends of the Cassavetes. In "Mystery Train," Jarmusch shows people visiting Sun Records and ties them all together with one incident, and we see what each character is doing at the time it happens. Very clever. Here, the thing that unites these characters is a cab ride. Very, very enjoyable, with lively characterizations, beautifully directed. Jarmusch is a quirky talent but a great one nonetheless.

    Night on Earth is a beautiful movie in all it's simplicity. In the center of the movie are the encounters of people, who maybe wouldn't meet otherwise, but in a taxi cab they get a connection to each other - or to themselves. The movie is a mixture of drama and black comedy (especially Roberto Benigni's character is unbelievably funny!) that carries through the movie. It consists of five quite different episodes located in different cities of the world. Although the main idea is quite simple, after seeing this movie you have a feeling that you have in some level at least learned or remembered something important about the world and human beings.

    The nights in the big cities have their very own mysterious and incomparable aura. Only the cab drivers who are circling the blocks after midnight and pick up ever changing passengers really have a sense of such a feeling, that strange kind of reality that engulfs them when everyone else is sleeping. You get a glimpse of the dark side of the aura if you follow De Niro's Travis Bickle in "Taxi Driver", and for the rest feel free to join independent film-maker Jim Jarmusch on five rides through L.A., New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki and see what the night has to offer. Writer/director Jarmusch celebrates the synchrony of events happening in various cabs all over the globe, where drama, fun and tragedy all take place at the same time while the earth takes another turn around its axis. All shot on location of the actual cities this episodic masterpiece was photographed excellently, there are some wonderful performances, lots of poignant moments and hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy. Armin M&uuml;ller-Stahl for example as German ex-clown "Helmet" going to "Brookland" clashing with NY culture is side-splittingly funny right from his greeting "Hello! How are YOU?" Then of course there is Roberto Benigni's wild confessional ride through Rome with a padre on the back seat, which has become an instant classic. Incredibly touching is also the final chapter in Helsinki with some drunkards exchanging tragic stories only to arrive at sunrise to catch some sleep. Or the one with the black cabbie, who learns to respect a blind woman and makes one wonder: Who's really the blind one? OK, OK, with all those overwhelmingly brilliant snapshots there's one obvious downside - which is the first tale, starring Wyona Rider as a small, but tough cookie: "I want to become a mechanic!" But after all taxi driving wasn't for her and she did eventually become an actress, didn't she?

    Jim Jarmusch directs five distinct taxi rides from different cities around the world. The first is set in Los Angeles with Wynona Ryder as the driver and Gena Rowland's as a Hollywood exec looking for an actress for role in a film. She feels that Ryder would be perfect for it so Ryder must make that decision. The second ride is in New York City with a German immigrant who picks up Yo Yo and his sister in law, Rosie Perez and they show him the highlights of Brooklyn. Number three is in Paris with a blind French passenger being driven by an African driver. They try to communicate but there is a big language and cultural barrier. Number four is in Rome with the cabbie picking up a priest and confessing all kinds of crazy sexual sins. This is the funniest segment of the bunch. The fifth and final one in set in Helsinki. Three drunken passengers who have been laid off from their jobs take a ride and describe their problems to the driver. Night on Earth is a charming vignette with music by Tom Waits.

    Few directors enjoy the cult status that Jarmusch does. Sadly, he is praised undeservedly, this film is not ingenious. So why do people praise him so much? The answer may appear at the conclusion of this review. The film's plot revolves around five taxi rides around the world, at night. They take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki. The way the movie is filmed is unambitious, the camera is placed in the taxi, the driver in the front seat (to the right of the screen), the passenger in the back seat (to the left of the screen). Technically (camera placement, cinematography, lighting etc) Jarmusch doesn't offer us anything new, so people shouldn't praise him for this. The worst part about this movie is the plot. Jarmusch shows us long and boring monologues, uninteresting dialogue and a very weak plot. This is why no studio will ever finance him. Oh, but he's proud of that, isn't he? The way people talk, and what they say is very boring. Even if you have a great actor playing the part, and saying the lines in a very interesting way, this doesn't make you interested. Imagine Morgan Freeman, or David Letterman saying "We're out of milk". Even if they do say it in a way which is most accurately described as awesome, you're still not interested. The great Kurosawa said "Though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a good script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a bad script". Jarmusch wrote this script in eight days. Jarmusch wrote a very bad script. You can say, "but this is how people talk in real life". If we were more entertained by real life than by movies, the movie industry would cease to exist. The reason we watch movies is to see something that we don't see everyday. Showing me something "real", something I can see everyday bores me. He isn't just showing people the way they talk in real life, he is showing us real life. He might as well have turned the camera on in a cab, and made a movie out of it. Writing a script in eight days is not impressive, it's insulting, he didn't put enough effort into it and it ends up sucking. If you are making a movie, put more effort into the script, because people watch movies. People deserve better, especially if they are paying to see the movie. Nothing happens in this movie, I'm serious, it's just people talking in a cab! That's it, nothing more! Jarmusch has said that he would rather make a movie about a man walking his dog, than a movie about the emperor of China. Does he LOVE emptiness in a movie? Does he LOVE a movie that has no story, or a very weak one? He is the biggest enemy of all fiction, he hates a good story, and he loves a bad one. He loves boring things. The most interesting thing about Jarmusch is his hair. The script is the major fault in this movie, because of the bad script the movie is terrible. The film has some good acting, I guess. Nothing memorable, though. Roberto Benigni is a great actor and director, see "A beautiful Life". Winona Rider is also respectable. The person who plays the Norwegian cab driver is very good, and his monologue, I will admit, is well written. It's not the imagery we see in Bergman's "Persona", a film which contains the single best monologue in history, but it's good. Jarmusch probably worked a whole day on it. The music in the film is not consistent with the tone. People talking in a cab at night is not Jazz. It's not The Blues. It's just people talking in a cab. Jarmusch put it in, probably because he likes Jazz, that's it. Why people like him still alludes me, but I'll give it a shot. It's because they don't want to like what everybody else likes. They want to be unique. They want to see independent film making, they probably also like Indy rock. It's OK to like something, but to wrongly preach about how great it is, when it's really just boring, and act as if you are better than people who don't like this film for a reason, that's wrong. I don't like this film for the reasons above, why you like it, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get Jarmusch.

Gena Rowlands is a casting agent landing in LA and being picked up by an offbeat taxi driver (Winona Ryder); Armin Muller-Stahl is an ex-German clown driving a cab in New York who picks up Giancarlo Esposito (who ends up driving) and later Rosie Perez; Isaach DeBankole is a taxi driver in Paris who throws three idiots out of his cab and picks up a blind girl (Beatrice Dalle); Roberto Begnini is a taxi driver in Rome who confesses all kinds of sex acts to the bishop he's driving (Paolo Bonacelli); and Matti Pelonpaa is a cab driver in Helsinki who tells his sad story to his passengers. Each vignette is wonderful and indicative of the country in which the characters reside. My favorite is the New York City sequence, which is out and out hysterical, with Armin Muller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez, all of whom are fabulous. And if you ever lived in New York, you can relate to the difficulty in getting a cab that will take you to the boroughs, especially late at night - it was all so typical, as the scenes in the other countries probably were as well. I would have to put what is practically a monologue by Roberto Begnini next. It's definitely the most absurd as he confesses the grossest things to the overwhelmed bishop. Very black comedy. If I have a least favorite, it's the first one, as it was fairly predictable and Winona Ryder as a taxi driver with aspirations to be a mechanic was unconvincing. Gena Rowlands, however, looked gorgeous and has an in joke while on the phone: "I'm supposed to have dinner with Shera and Peter tonight," meaning Shera Danese and Peter Falk, best friends of the Cassavetes. In "Mystery Train," Jarmusch shows people visiting Sun Records and ties them all together with one incident, and we see what each character is doing at the time it happens. Very clever. Here, the thing that unites these characters is a cab ride. Very, very enjoyable, with lively characterizations, beautifully directed. Jarmusch is a quirky talent but a great one nonetheless.

    Night on Earth is a beautiful movie in all it's simplicity. In the center of the movie are the encounters of people, who maybe wouldn't meet otherwise, but in a taxi cab they get a connection to each other - or to themselves. The movie is a mixture of drama and black comedy (especially Roberto Benigni's character is unbelievably funny!) that carries through the movie. It consists of five quite different episodes located in different cities of the world. Although the main idea is quite simple, after seeing this movie you have a feeling that you have in some level at least learned or remembered something important about the world and human beings.

    The nights in the big cities have their very own mysterious and incomparable aura. Only the cab drivers who are circling the blocks after midnight and pick up ever changing passengers really have a sense of such a feeling, that strange kind of reality that engulfs them when everyone else is sleeping. You get a glimpse of the dark side of the aura if you follow De Niro's Travis Bickle in "Taxi Driver", and for the rest feel free to join independent film-maker Jim Jarmusch on five rides through L.A., New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki and see what the night has to offer. Writer/director Jarmusch celebrates the synchrony of events happening in various cabs all over the globe, where drama, fun and tragedy all take place at the same time while the earth takes another turn around its axis. All shot on location of the actual cities this episodic masterpiece was photographed excellently, there are some wonderful performances, lots of poignant moments and hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy. Armin M&uuml;ller-Stahl for example as German ex-clown "Helmet" going to "Brookland" clashing with NY culture is side-splittingly funny right from his greeting "Hello! How are YOU?" Then of course there is Roberto Benigni's wild confessional ride through Rome with a padre on the back seat, which has become an instant classic. Incredibly touching is also the final chapter in Helsinki with some drunkards exchanging tragic stories only to arrive at sunrise to catch some sleep. Or the one with the black cabbie, who learns to respect a blind woman and makes one wonder: Who's really the blind one? OK, OK, with all those overwhelmingly brilliant snapshots there's one obvious downside - which is the first tale, starring Wyona Rider as a small, but tough cookie: "I want to become a mechanic!" But after all taxi driving wasn't for her and she did eventually become an actress, didn't she?

    Jim Jarmusch directs five distinct taxi rides from different cities around the world. The first is set in Los Angeles with Wynona Ryder as the driver and Gena Rowland's as a Hollywood exec looking for an actress for role in a film. She feels that Ryder would be perfect for it so Ryder must make that decision. The second ride is in New York City with a German immigrant who picks up Yo Yo and his sister in law, Rosie Perez and they show him the highlights of Brooklyn. Number three is in Paris with a blind French passenger being driven by an African driver. They try to communicate but there is a big language and cultural barrier. Number four is in Rome with the cabbie picking up a priest and confessing all kinds of crazy sexual sins. This is the funniest segment of the bunch. The fifth and final one in set in Helsinki. Three drunken passengers who have been laid off from their jobs take a ride and describe their problems to the driver. Night on Earth is a charming vignette with music by Tom Waits.

    Few directors enjoy the cult status that Jarmusch does. Sadly, he is praised undeservedly, this film is not ingenious. So why do people praise him so much? The answer may appear at the conclusion of this review. The film's plot revolves around five taxi rides around the world, at night. They take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki. The way the movie is filmed is unambitious, the camera is placed in the taxi, the driver in the front seat (to the right of the screen), the passenger in the back seat (to the left of the screen). Technically (camera placement, cinematography, lighting etc) Jarmusch doesn't offer us anything new, so people shouldn't praise him for this. The worst part about this movie is the plot. Jarmusch shows us long and boring monologues, uninteresting dialogue and a very weak plot. This is why no studio will ever finance him. Oh, but he's proud of that, isn't he? The way people talk, and what they say is very boring. Even if you have a great actor playing the part, and saying the lines in a very interesting way, this doesn't make you interested. Imagine Morgan Freeman, or David Letterman saying "We're out of milk". Even if they do say it in a way which is most accurately described as awesome, you're still not interested. The great Kurosawa said "Though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a good script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a bad script". Jarmusch wrote this script in eight days. Jarmusch wrote a very bad script. You can say, "but this is how people talk in real life". If we were more entertained by real life than by movies, the movie industry would cease to exist. The reason we watch movies is to see something that we don't see everyday. Showing me something "real", something I can see everyday bores me. He isn't just showing people the way they talk in real life, he is showing us real life. He might as well have turned the camera on in a cab, and made a movie out of it. Writing a script in eight days is not impressive, it's insulting, he didn't put enough effort into it and it ends up sucking. If you are making a movie, put more effort into the script, because people watch movies. People deserve better, especially if they are paying to see the movie. Nothing happens in this movie, I'm serious, it's just people talking in a cab! That's it, nothing more! Jarmusch has said that he would rather make a movie about a man walking his dog, than a movie about the emperor of China. Does he LOVE emptiness in a movie? Does he LOVE a movie that has no story, or a very weak one? He is the biggest enemy of all fiction, he hates a good story, and he loves a bad one. He loves boring things. The most interesting thing about Jarmusch is his hair. The script is the major fault in this movie, because of the bad script the movie is terrible. The film has some good acting, I guess. Nothing memorable, though. Roberto Benigni is a great actor and director, see "A beautiful Life". Winona Rider is also respectable. The person who plays the Norwegian cab driver is very good, and his monologue, I will admit, is well written. It's not the imagery we see in Bergman's "Persona", a film which contains the single best monologue in history, but it's good. Jarmusch probably worked a whole day on it. The music in the film is not consistent with the tone. People talking in a cab at night is not Jazz. It's not The Blues. It's just people talking in a cab. Jarmusch put it in, probably because he likes Jazz, that's it. Why people like him still alludes me, but I'll give it a shot. It's because they don't want to like what everybody else likes. They want to be unique. They want to see independent film making, they probably also like Indy rock. It's OK to like something, but to wrongly preach about how great it is, when it's really just boring, and act as if you are better than people who don't like this film for a reason, that's wrong. I don't like this film for the reasons above, why you like it, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get Jarmusch.

    I can't believe that IMDb watchers rated this a 7.7 stars, they must've been high on some kind of serious drugs or something! Five pointless stories about five foreign cabdrivers. This film makes you think that something is going to happen around the next turn but nothing does, no cool twists or anything funny just boring stories that made my girlfriend fall asleep. The first two stories were better than the last three. The boring story with Winona Ryder was probably the best, this was one of her first films and must not have read the script very well. She must have needed some money real bad to decide to do this horrible movie. Get ready to put your ear plugs in when you see Rosie Perez coming with her annoying shrieking voice of darkness! This scene was really annoying even the drunks in the ghetto wanted to tell her to shut up. I was hoping that each story might have some type of twist coming into the plot, but they never did and I was very surprised I watched the last two stories, they just got worse as they went along. The last three of them are even captioned, you actually have to take the extra energy to read the words, so really!!!  Don't bother with this movie, it really sucked. Absolutely pointless, none of them had any substance.

    Night on Earth is an odd little film from an odd little director named Jim Jarmush. I'm a fan of Jarmush's style in writing and directing and he really tries to shine through this film. It tells five different stories about five taxi cab drivers in four different countries in one night. Each story is very different and none of them really begin or end. It is really five snippets of the strange occurrences which happen between us at night. The stories take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. The film is very loose and very odd, making it interesting yet sometimes hard to really become devoted to. There is no real connection, blatant, or metaphoric, between the five stories. They all seem to be in their own little worlds simply documenting the happenings that go on late at night in taxi cabs. It could be argued that the films only goal is to document these melancholy little tales, not having any other motives and not trying to be any more than an anthology of stories. From this perspective the film just ends up being pretty dull when you look at it as a whole. Each story in its own right is fairly entertaining and it can be plenty amusing, but anything and everything that happens in this film ultimately amounts to nothing. The film really goes nowhere and doesn't seem to accomplish anything. But again, maybe it isn't trying to. Maybe it is simply just a portrait of the quiet night life that occurs in 4:00 AM taxi cabs. The only thing that is certain is that Jarmush has taken some playful liberties with the storytelling medium and has created a film that is very different. Once you get past the fact that Night on Earth really isn't trying to do anything amazing, you can appreciate it a lot more for the good things about it. Jarmush's script is great and he writes witty banter excellently. There is little to no action in the film. It is all about the dialogue as the actors sit in their taxi cabs and discuss life, death, and everything else. Luckily, the dialogue is the most engaging thing about the film when it needs to be. It is that and the great acting by all the performers. None of the five stories fall flat from an acting standpoint and they only grow more and more interesting until the last story which takes place in Helsinki which is most definitely the most enthralling. There are plenty of great things going for this film, I'm just not sure what any of it is supposed to mean and what purpose anything in this movie serves. Better yet, I don't know that this movie has a purpose. Regardless, Jarmush has made a very interesting film with Night on Earth it is intelligent and almost always entertaining. There's nothing here to make me dislike the film but at the same time that is the problem. There isn't much here so I can't love it either. All in all it is a film of high quality and class, but at the same time it feels a little empty because of no real connection or leading element to fuel the film. Night on Earth is a good film, but it is really nothing more than five separate short stories with no real beginning and no real end.

    That's the first word which comes to me just after seeing the movie : delightful. Jarmusch shows what life is or should be : a succession of sweet funny/essential moments made of chance encounters which could happen everywhere, at any time, even in a cab with somebody you don't know at all. Maybe we are just too blind to see/feel these moments as special as they are though. Moreover, Night on Earth is really funny. A sharp sense of humor. With a tremendous Roberto Benigni making conversation to a priest, speaking alone about pumpkins or sheep. With the so impassive Isaach De Bankol&eacute;, trying to understand how a blind person could live, before realizing they see better than the sighted. After seeing this movie, you strangely want to become a cab-driver in a big city somewhere...

    This is a film that is strictly about character. Or should I say characters? A set of five little twenty minute films, set in and around taxi cabs, allowing the characters to interact and expose their loves and their fears, their baggage and their hopes. Each is strong or weak in its own way. The first, with Winona Ryder is, to me, the weakest, although I couldn't take my eyes off her. There is subtlety and a delicate touch to all of them. My favorite was the Finnish one. The most contrived and least human was the Italian one with Roberto Benigni. While it was outrageous, it was a long running gag, a kind of cruel joke. In the other the four, the people were interesting and accessible. Their lives were realistic and, in some ways, cruel, yet their stories moved us. All things considered, it is a unique idea and has enough to recommend it. Also, there's the music of Tom Waits. What more could you want.

    This is only the second(the other being Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai) film by Jarmusch I watch, even though my interest in him has been growing for a while. If you've been exposed to anything by him or at least heard about it, you know that he's not mainstream. He makes movies comparable to short stories(not necessarily the most recent brand of such, those get to be all about your own interpretation, and are very vague). Slices of life. This visits five different cities around the world(New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Helsinki), and thus contains four different languages(!), as three of these places are in Europe. Different classes and types of people meet, as each time we go to a new place, we follow a cabbie and his fare(sometimes plural), all in this one night, possibly starting at the same time. There is no overarching plot connecting them all; what makes them similar is that they're all human beings with a history and personalities. The realism is high, if there are oddities. Not all the characters are likable(and there are stereotypes among them), but they tend to be interesting and credible(flawed, *real*), same as their backgrounds. The acting is great, with some performances being downright excellent. This is carried by the dialog, what is said(and in what way), and what isn't. Other than establishing shots of the 5 places(that are not all alike, going right from a metropolis to something you could almost call quaint), most of what we see are the drivers and the passengers, there are no flashbacks and occurrences are largely retold, not seen. The editing and cinematography are subtle; the focus here is on the content, not the form. There is also hardly any music, other than the main theme, which has variations on it for where on Earth we are(and in what culture) when we hear it, so to speak. The majority of the humor is discreet, as well, with the obvious exception of Benigni(and arguably the NY segment). There is plenty of swearing, a bit of sexuality in the lines and a little disgusting content in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes pictures like these. 8/10

    I can't believe that IMDb watchers rated this a 7.7 stars, they must've been high on some kind of serious drugs or something! Five pointless stories about five foreign cabdrivers. This film makes you think that something is going to happen around the next turn but nothing does, no cool twists or anything funny just boring stories that made my girlfriend fall asleep. The first two stories were better than the last three. The boring story with Winona Ryder was probably the best, this was one of her first films and must not have read the script very well. She must have needed some money real bad to decide to do this horrible movie. Get ready to put your ear plugs in when you see Rosie Perez coming with her annoying shrieking voice of darkness! This scene was really annoying even the drunks in the ghetto wanted to tell her to shut up. I was hoping that each story might have some type of twist coming into the plot, but they never did and I was very surprised I watched the last two stories, they just got worse as they went along. The last three of them are even captioned, you actually have to take the extra energy to read the words, so really!!!  Don't bother with this movie, it really sucked. Absolutely pointless, none of them had any substance.

    Night on Earth is an odd little film from an odd little director named Jim Jarmush. I'm a fan of Jarmush's style in writing and directing and he really tries to shine through this film. It tells five different stories about five taxi cab drivers in four different countries in one night. Each story is very different and none of them really begin or end. It is really five snippets of the strange occurrences which happen between us at night. The stories take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. The film is very loose and very odd, making it interesting yet sometimes hard to really become devoted to. There is no real connection, blatant, or metaphoric, between the five stories. They all seem to be in their own little worlds simply documenting the happenings that go on late at night in taxi cabs. It could be argued that the films only goal is to document these melancholy little tales, not having any other motives and not trying to be any more than an anthology of stories. From this perspective the film just ends up being pretty dull when you look at it as a whole. Each story in its own right is fairly entertaining and it can be plenty amusing, but anything and everything that happens in this film ultimately amounts to nothing. The film really goes nowhere and doesn't seem to accomplish anything. But again, maybe it isn't trying to. Maybe it is simply just a portrait of the quiet night life that occurs in 4:00 AM taxi cabs. The only thing that is certain is that Jarmush has taken some playful liberties with the storytelling medium and has created a film that is very different. Once you get past the fact that Night on Earth really isn't trying to do anything amazing, you can appreciate it a lot more for the good things about it. Jarmush's script is great and he writes witty banter excellently. There is little to no action in the film. It is all about the dialogue as the actors sit in their taxi cabs and discuss life, death, and everything else. Luckily, the dialogue is the most engaging thing about the film when it needs to be. It is that and the great acting by all the performers. None of the five stories fall flat from an acting standpoint and they only grow more and more interesting until the last story which takes place in Helsinki which is most definitely the most enthralling. There are plenty of great things going for this film, I'm just not sure what any of it is supposed to mean and what purpose anything in this movie serves. Better yet, I don't know that this movie has a purpose. Regardless, Jarmush has made a very interesting film with Night on Earth it is intelligent and almost always entertaining. There's nothing here to make me dislike the film but at the same time that is the problem. There isn't much here so I can't love it either. All in all it is a film of high quality and class, but at the same time it feels a little empty because of no real connection or leading element to fuel the film. Night on Earth is a good film, but it is really nothing more than five separate short stories with no real beginning and no real end.

    That's the first word which comes to me just after seeing the movie : delightful. Jarmusch shows what life is or should be : a succession of sweet funny/essential moments made of chance encounters which could happen everywhere, at any time, even in a cab with somebody you don't know at all. Maybe we are just too blind to see/feel these moments as special as they are though. Moreover, Night on Earth is really funny. A sharp sense of humor. With a tremendous Roberto Benigni making conversation to a priest, speaking alone about pumpkins or sheep. With the so impassive Isaach De Bankol&eacute;, trying to understand how a blind person could live, before realizing they see better than the sighted. After seeing this movie, you strangely want to become a cab-driver in a big city somewhere...

    This is a film that is strictly about character. Or should I say characters? A set of five little twenty minute films, set in and around taxi cabs, allowing the characters to interact and expose their loves and their fears, their baggage and their hopes. Each is strong or weak in its own way. The first, with Winona Ryder is, to me, the weakest, although I couldn't take my eyes off her. There is subtlety and a delicate touch to all of them. My favorite was the Finnish one. The most contrived and least human was the Italian one with Roberto Benigni. While it was outrageous, it was a long running gag, a kind of cruel joke. In the other the four, the people were interesting and accessible. Their lives were realistic and, in some ways, cruel, yet their stories moved us. All things considered, it is a unique idea and has enough to recommend it. Also, there's the music of Tom Waits. What more could you want.

    This is only the second(the other being Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai) film by Jarmusch I watch, even though my interest in him has been growing for a while. If you've been exposed to anything by him or at least heard about it, you know that he's not mainstream. He makes movies comparable to short stories(not necessarily the most recent brand of such, those get to be all about your own interpretation, and are very vague). Slices of life. This visits five different cities around the world(New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Helsinki), and thus contains four different languages(!), as three of these places are in Europe. Different classes and types of people meet, as each time we go to a new place, we follow a cabbie and his fare(sometimes plural), all in this one night, possibly starting at the same time. There is no overarching plot connecting them all; what makes them similar is that they're all human beings with a history and personalities. The realism is high, if there are oddities. Not all the characters are likable(and there are stereotypes among them), but they tend to be interesting and credible(flawed, *real*), same as their backgrounds. The acting is great, with some performances being downright excellent. This is carried by the dialog, what is said(and in what way), and what isn't. Other than establishing shots of the 5 places(that are not all alike, going right from a metropolis to something you could almost call quaint), most of what we see are the drivers and the passengers, there are no flashbacks and occurrences are largely retold, not seen. The editing and cinematography are subtle; the focus here is on the content, not the form. There is also hardly any music, other than the main theme, which has variations on it for where on Earth we are(and in what culture) when we hear it, so to speak. The majority of the humor is discreet, as well, with the obvious exception of Benigni(and arguably the NY segment). There is plenty of swearing, a bit of sexuality in the lines and a little disgusting content in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes pictures like these. 8/10

    Jim Jarmusch does a great job with vignettes, as we've seen in "Mystery Train" and "Coffee and Cigarettes." Here he unites the world with the same incident -- someone taking a cab -- but different experiences in different cultures. Gena Rowlands is a casting agent landing in LA and being picked up by an offbeat taxi driver (Winona Ryder); Armin Muller-Stahl is an ex-German clown driving a cab in New York who picks up Giancarlo Esposito (who ends up driving) and later Rosie Perez; Isaach DeBankole is a taxi driver in Paris who throws three idiots out of his cab and picks up a blind girl (Beatrice Dalle); Roberto Begnini is a taxi driver in Rome who confesses all kinds of sex acts to the bishop he's driving (Paolo Bonacelli); and Matti Pelonpaa is a cab driver in Helsinki who tells his sad story to his passengers. Each vignette is wonderful and indicative of the country in which the characters reside. My favorite is the New York City sequence, which is out and out hysterical, with Armin Muller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez, all of whom are fabulous. And if you ever lived in New York, you can relate to the difficulty in getting a cab that will take you to the boroughs, especially late at night - it was all so typical, as the scenes in the other countries probably were as well. I would have to put what is practically a monologue by Roberto Begnini next. It's definitely the most absurd as he confesses the grossest things to the overwhelmed bishop. Very black comedy. If I have a least favorite, it's the first one, as it was fairly predictable and Winona Ryder as a taxi driver with aspirations to be a mechanic was unconvincing. Gena Rowlands, however, looked gorgeous and has an in joke while on the phone: "I'm supposed to have dinner with Shera and Peter tonight," meaning Shera Danese and Peter Falk, best friends of the Cassavetes. In "Mystery Train," Jarmusch shows people visiting Sun Records and ties them all together with one incident, and we see what each character is doing at the time it happens. Very clever. Here, the thing that unites these characters is a cab ride. Very, very enjoyable, with lively characterizations, beautifully directed. Jarmusch is a quirky talent but a great one nonetheless.

    Night on Earth is a beautiful movie in all it's simplicity. In the center of the movie are the encounters of people, who maybe wouldn't meet otherwise, but in a taxi cab they get a connection to each other - or to themselves. The movie is a mixture of drama and black comedy (especially Roberto Benigni's character is unbelievably funny!) that carries through the movie. It consists of five quite different episodes located in different cities of the world. Although the main idea is quite simple, after seeing this movie you have a feeling that you have in some level at least learned or remembered something important about the world and human beings.

    The nights in the big cities have their very own mysterious and incomparable aura. Only the cab drivers who are circling the blocks after midnight and pick up ever changing passengers really have a sense of such a feeling, that strange kind of reality that engulfs them when everyone else is sleeping. You get a glimpse of the dark side of the aura if you follow De Niro's Travis Bickle in "Taxi Driver", and for the rest feel free to join independent film-maker Jim Jarmusch on five rides through L.A., New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki and see what the night has to offer. Writer/director Jarmusch celebrates the synchrony of events happening in various cabs all over the globe, where drama, fun and tragedy all take place at the same time while the earth takes another turn around its axis. All shot on location of the actual cities this episodic masterpiece was photographed excellently, there are some wonderful performances, lots of poignant moments and hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy. Armin M&uuml;ller-Stahl for example as German ex-clown "Helmet" going to "Brookland" clashing with NY culture is side-splittingly funny right from his greeting "Hello! How are YOU?" Then of course there is Roberto Benigni's wild confessional ride through Rome with a padre on the back seat, which has become an instant classic. Incredibly touching is also the final chapter in Helsinki with some drunkards exchanging tragic stories only to arrive at sunrise to catch some sleep. Or the one with the black cabbie, who learns to respect a blind woman and makes one wonder: Who's really the blind one? OK, OK, with all those overwhelmingly brilliant snapshots there's one obvious downside - which is the first tale, starring Wyona Rider as a small, but tough cookie: "I want to become a mechanic!" But after all taxi driving wasn't for her and she did eventually become an actress, didn't she?

    Jim Jarmusch directs five distinct taxi rides from different cities around the world. The first is set in Los Angeles with Wynona Ryder as the driver and Gena Rowland's as a Hollywood exec looking for an actress for role in a film. She feels that Ryder would be perfect for it so Ryder must make that decision. The second ride is in New York City with a German immigrant who picks up Yo Yo and his sister in law, Rosie Perez and they show him the highlights of Brooklyn. Number three is in Paris with a blind French passenger being driven by an African driver. They try to communicate but there is a big language and cultural barrier. Number four is in Rome with the cabbie picking up a priest and confessing all kinds of crazy sexual sins. This is the funniest segment of the bunch. The fifth and final one in set in Helsinki. Three drunken passengers who have been laid off from their jobs take a ride and describe their problems to the driver. Night on Earth is a charming vignette with music by Tom Waits.

    Few directors enjoy the cult status that Jarmusch does. Sadly, he is praised undeservedly, this film is not ingenious. So why do people praise him so much? The answer may appear at the conclusion of this review. The film's plot revolves around five taxi rides around the world, at night. They take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki. The way the movie is filmed is unambitious, the camera is placed in the taxi, the driver in the front seat (to the right of the screen), the passenger in the back seat (to the left of the screen). Technically (camera placement, cinematography, lighting etc) Jarmusch doesn't offer us anything new, so people shouldn't praise him for this. The worst part about this movie is the plot. Jarmusch shows us long and boring monologues, uninteresting dialogue and a very weak plot. This is why no studio will ever finance him. Oh, but he's proud of that, isn't he? The way people talk, and what they say is very boring. Even if you have a great actor playing the part, and saying the lines in a very interesting way, this doesn't make you interested. Imagine Morgan Freeman, or David Letterman saying "We're out of milk". Even if they do say it in a way which is most accurately described as awesome, you're still not interested. The great Kurosawa said "Though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a good script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a bad script". Jarmusch wrote this script in eight days. Jarmusch wrote a very bad script. You can say, "but this is how people talk in real life". If we were more entertained by real life than by movies, the movie industry would cease to exist. The reason we watch movies is to see something that we don't see everyday. Showing me something "real", something I can see everyday bores me. He isn't just showing people the way they talk in real life, he is showing us real life. He might as well have turned the camera on in a cab, and made a movie out of it. Writing a script in eight days is not impressive, it's insulting, he didn't put enough effort into it and it ends up sucking. If you are making a movie, put more effort into the script, because people watch movies. People deserve better, especially if they are paying to see the movie. Nothing happens in this movie, I'm serious, it's just people talking in a cab! That's it, nothing more! Jarmusch has said that he would rather make a movie about a man walking his dog, than a movie about the emperor of China. Does he LOVE emptiness in a movie? Does he LOVE a movie that has no story, or a very weak one? He is the biggest enemy of all fiction, he hates a good story, and he loves a bad one. He loves boring things. The most interesting thing about Jarmusch is his hair. The script is the major fault in this movie, because of the bad script the movie is terrible. The film has some good acting, I guess. Nothing memorable, though. Roberto Benigni is a great actor and director, see "A beautiful Life". Winona Rider is also respectable. The person who plays the Norwegian cab driver is very good, and his monologue, I will admit, is well written. It's not the imagery we see in Bergman's "Persona", a film which contains the single best monologue in history, but it's good. Jarmusch probably worked a whole day on it. The music in the film is not consistent with the tone. People talking in a cab at night is not Jazz. It's not The Blues. It's just people talking in a cab. Jarmusch put it in, probably because he likes Jazz, that's it. Why people like him still alludes me, but I'll give it a shot. It's because they don't want to like what everybody else likes. They want to be unique. They want to see independent film making, they probably also like Indy rock. It's OK to like something, but to wrongly preach about how great it is, when it's really just boring, and act as if you are better than people who don't like this film for a reason, that's wrong. I don't like this film for the reasons above, why you like it, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get Jarmusch.
