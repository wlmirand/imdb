    Woa I remember when I thought this e-Striptease movie starring Demi Moore was trashy and obscene back then.... now it's actually more prude that the usual music video on MTV. Demi Moore gave her 100% in the stripper character and wasn't afraid of breaking new grounds and offending people in 1996. This is a recipe for success, just like Madonna did for the entire lifetime of her career. I love especially the scene where she stripteases from a cabaret costume with the fedora hat. Hot! And all this plot about the gangster guys and how she needs to protect her and her daughter makes it a timeless, revolutionary movie in my opinion. a+. For the relatively low budget at the time in 1996 this movie is a modern masterpiece in my opinion and since almost 20 years no one has even dared to replicate such subject matter and plot on the big screen.

    Good lord, this movie abuses every conceivable clich&eacute; possible. Imagine a movie about strippers. These strippers are different because they're naive, put upon, victims being forced to degrade themselves for icky men against their will. None of them are just whores or anything, and all of them, especially our heroine, have angelic hearts of gold. They are protected by large African American guardian "Shad". The plot centers around "Erin", played by Demi Moore, who was an FBI secretary until her husband's misbehavior got her fired and caused the dissolution of their marriage and an ensuing custody battle. The husband is not a great guy, as you can imagine, and takes their child, who is so un-important as a character that I can't remember her name, and engages in a wheelchair theft scam. Unable to win custody through legal means as a result of her occupation as a stripper, Erin illegally abducts the child. An elderly congressmen attempts to recruit Erin into his harem, using knowledge of the illegal abduction as leverage. You can pretty much use your imagination for everything that happens next. From here, the clich&eacute; abuse continues as it becomes a foregone conclusion that Erin is a near perfect mother and there is never any meaningfully developed conflict about her struggle raising a child given her choice of occupation. Just a stripper who's a great human being on the inside warring against her victimizers. The acting is horrendous, the characters are flat, the plot is predictable and contrived. And on top of this, despite being a movie about strippers, it was completely unsexy and un-arousing in any manner. The only thing that saves this from being a 1/10 are unintentionally comedic non-sequitors. The horrific and one dimensional portrayal of the congressman, for instance, crossed into strangely amusing territory at times, and something similar happens with Erin's ex-husband.

    Striptease is about a stripper who becomes involved in both a child- custody dispute and corrupt politics.It is a sex comedy film directed, produced, and written by Andrew Bergman. The film stars Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds, and Ving Rhames. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Carl Hiaasen. The screenplay,based on a satirical novel, tells the story of Erin, who has just gotten a divorce from Darrell, the sleazy ex-con she foolishly married. However, the judge's memories of Darrell's days as a football hero win him custody of their daughter, and Erin, concerned for her child's safety, is determined to fight the decision. Erin has just lost her position as a secretary for the FBI, so, to cover her legal bills, she takes a job as an exotic dancer at a strip club called the Eager Beaver. While she has no experience taking off her clothes in front of an audience, Erin soon makes friends with the fellow dancers and finds a protector in the club's burly but good-hearted bouncer, Shad. She also makes a few fans among the regulars at the club, most notably David Dillbeck, a drunken lout with a bottomless appetite for sleaze -- who also happens to be a conservative congressman with ties to right-wing religious groups. One of Erin's admirers snaps a photo of her with the congressman when a brawl breaks out at the club, and he suggests that it would make fine blackmail material. However, when the man with the photo turns up dead, Erin discovers that Dillbeck's people play a bit rougher than she expected. This movie showcases nothing but Demi Moore's star appeal and sexy body.Nothing more.Andrew Bergman's screenplay and storyline was a complete mess.Personally,I do believe that this movie,Striptease together with G.I. Jane,practically placed Moore's stardom into a downhill and it never recovered since then.She could have been a better actress had she chosen better materials after attaining popularity in Ghost instead of going for the high paycheck that movie offers come her way that does nothing except use her star appeal rather than her showcase her acting ability.

    While Andrew Bergman's adaptation fails to capture the essence of Carl Hiaasen's satirical novel it nevertheless is nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests. Demi Moore, whose career was already on a downward slide judging by the number of times she bares her breasts, plays a mother who is forced to work in a strip joint to earn the income necessary to fight for custody of her daughter, the care of whom a condescending judge has awarded to her low-life husband (Robert Patrick). While on the job, she catches the eye of a sleazy senator (Burt Reynolds) who is prepared to go to any odds to have her perform a private dance. While it's fair to say that the film completely botches the satirical aspects of Hiaasen's story, it still manages to provide an absorbing story after an undeniably shaky start. The nudity isn't as in your face as you'd expect, and in fact becomes almost incidental as the story moves along. The cast are all reasonably good, with Reynolds and Patrick in particular standing out: Reynold's character could have been something of a classic had it been toned down a little  although he's still likable in a sleazy sort of way, he's just too downright weird for the audience to take to him completely. Patrick's low-life husband is also likable despite his failings and Patrick works hard to make him this way. His drunken intrusion into the senator's long-awaited private dance with a cheery 'evenin' party-goers' is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. Ving Rhames also scores as an outwardly surly bouncer with a soft spot for all the girls in his charge. I suppose in a way, Striptease has something of an advantage due to its reputation: you come into it expecting very little, so the fact that it's got an engrossing  if far-fetched plot  works in its favour. Worth a try if you're in the mood.

    Its just a straight up guy movie. No intricate plot. Just stripping. Demi Moore has an excellent body, considering she was a mother at the time, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's just a movie for perverted men, but that doesn't mean it can't be funny and worth watching. Ving Rhames plays his character well making him hilarious and interesting. I've only seen the original but it makes me wonder how much extra could be in the unrated version. Hopefully that'll be really worth a watch. Just from the title of the movie you keep waiting to see her perfectly sculpted body but you have to wait through a few strip scenes before you get to see her breasts.

    Ousted from her CIA job Erin takes her new breasts and serious expression over to a strip club called the 'Eager Beaver' to work as a stripper (I don't think dancers take their clothes off) to earn enough money to gain custody of her daughter. Ironic really as the cost of her boob job would probably have paid for the custody battle. The central character of Erin is played by Demi Moore who seems to have taken the role to show off the talents of her plastic surgeon; but sadly displayed little talent of her own. This is the films major downfall as the other actors are fine (especially Burt), but Demi's character does not gain any particular sympathy as she is alternately intense, reproving, frowning, stern, serious and then back to intense again. "Even with a great body you can be a serious actor" she seems to be saying. In short, Demi was boring and I really did not care whether she won or not. Demi does have a great bod, but personally I find her strangely sexless and preferred any of the other women she worked with. Burt also seems to be the type that would have gone for the blond with the huge breasts rather than the antiseptic Ms Moore. I know I did.

    As with most comments I'd imagine Carl Hiassen is fairly annoyed. I've read most of his books, and they are riotously funny and extremely inventive. Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

    This movie tries to tell the story of a desperate mother fighting for her daughter, but forgets that plot usually doesn't involve awful comedy skits. The mix really doesn't work, and the clash between Demi Moore's overly serious acting and Burt Reynolds' whatever the hell Burt Reynolds was doing couldn't be more off-putting. The boat scenes, dear God the boat scenes, the memory just won't go away. That's what I call nightmare fuel. Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames are also in this movie, which I guess makes it a bit cooler than it deserves to be. Their characters aren't interesting in the slightest, but hey, they're still Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. As well as pretty much every other aspect from this weak, overlong movie, I really hated the climax. If that's the best solution you can come up with, you might want to consider not making movies. This movie may not be as bad as "Showgirls", but it's also one hell of a lot less entertaining.

    The Good: VING RHAMES - I suspect the only actor who actually bothered to read the book. He had just the right mixture of menace and ineptitude; so much so that I forgot that when I read the book I'd assumed his character was white (I don't think his colour is explicitly stated); RENA RIFFEL - a truly gorgeous and sadly overlooked starlet (who was also in the oft-mentioned 'Showgirls'); underused, but looking her delicious best. The Bad: How Carl Hiaason must feel. The Truly Atrocious: Just about everything else, from hammy Bert to drammy Demi; and Pandora Peaks proving that porn-stars should not be given anything as difficult as lines. I also read somewhere that Demi Moore had "artistic"(?) control over the character of Erin written into her contract; well, this is the result - a confused and toothless adaptation of a wonderfully raunchy (and *funny*) book. Andrew Bergman doesn't show anything in his IMDb log for seven years after he penned this turkey...and it serves him right. The Lesson: Don't let the inmates take over the asylum. My vote: 3/10 for Ving and Rena alone.

    I was cruising through my movie channels and I saw that Striptease was playing, I remember seeing the trailer for this movie back in 1994 when I was a kid and wanted to see it, oh, my parents had to forbid it. But of course since I'm 23 and on my own, I think I was allowed to view it. I kinda wish now that I had my parents here to tell me no because this movie was really bad. I mean most people make fun of Showgirls, I mean yeah, it's understandable, but at least that had personality and more memorable moments than this. Demi Moore just strips down to some really depressing music and this movie has the strangest humor in the world. I could see how some people might get a kick out of it, but over all it just a bad movie, it has no zest and nothing to make it special. A story about a stripper... OK, here it goes. The film revolves around Erin Grant, a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favor. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from her negligent husband. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much information. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. Demi is alright in the movie, if even that, I'm being pretty generous considering she let her daughter, Rumor, act as her daughter in this movie. If I were Rumor, I'd be like "next time, I pick the mother/daughter bonding event". I wouldn't really feel like watching my mother dance around naked for men nore a camera. Well Rumor must have gotten a huge raise in her allowance for that to happen. But anyways, I wouldn't recommend Striptease, it was a sleazy movie, I would even go as far to say that if you want sleaze, go for Showgirls, it's more fun to watch and make fun of, this was just a sad movie. 1/10

Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

    The Good: VING RHAMES - I suspect the only actor who actually bothered to read the book. He had just the right mixture of menace and ineptitude; so much so that I forgot that when I read the book I'd assumed his character was white (I don't think his colour is explicitly stated); RENA RIFFEL - a truly gorgeous and sadly overlooked starlet (who was also in the oft-mentioned 'Showgirls'); underused, but looking her delicious best. The Bad: How Carl Hiaason must feel. The Truly Atrocious: Just about everything else, from hammy Bert to drammy Demi; and Pandora Peaks proving that porn-stars should not be given anything as difficult as lines. I also read somewhere that Demi Moore had "artistic"(?) control over the character of Erin written into her contract; well, this is the result - a confused and toothless adaptation of a wonderfully raunchy (and *funny*) book. Andrew Bergman doesn't show anything in his IMDb log for seven years after he penned this turkey...and it serves him right. The Lesson: Don't let the inmates take over the asylum. My vote: 3/10 for Ving and Rena alone.

    I was cruising through my movie channels and I saw that Striptease was playing, I remember seeing the trailer for this movie back in 1994 when I was a kid and wanted to see it, oh, my parents had to forbid it. But of course since I'm 23 and on my own, I think I was allowed to view it. I kinda wish now that I had my parents here to tell me no because this movie was really bad. I mean most people make fun of Showgirls, I mean yeah, it's understandable, but at least that had personality and more memorable moments than this. Demi Moore just strips down to some really depressing music and this movie has the strangest humor in the world. I could see how some people might get a kick out of it, but over all it just a bad movie, it has no zest and nothing to make it special. A story about a stripper... OK, here it goes. The film revolves around Erin Grant, a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favor. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from her negligent husband. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much information. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. Demi is alright in the movie, if even that, I'm being pretty generous considering she let her daughter, Rumor, act as her daughter in this movie. If I were Rumor, I'd be like "next time, I pick the mother/daughter bonding event". I wouldn't really feel like watching my mother dance around naked for men nore a camera. Well Rumor must have gotten a huge raise in her allowance for that to happen. But anyways, I wouldn't recommend Striptease, it was a sleazy movie, I would even go as far to say that if you want sleaze, go for Showgirls, it's more fun to watch and make fun of, this was just a sad movie. 1/10

    Woa I remember when I thought this e-Striptease movie starring Demi Moore was trashy and obscene back then.... now it's actually more prude that the usual music video on MTV. Demi Moore gave her 100% in the stripper character and wasn't afraid of breaking new grounds and offending people in 1996. This is a recipe for success, just like Madonna did for the entire lifetime of her career. I love especially the scene where she stripteases from a cabaret costume with the fedora hat. Hot! And all this plot about the gangster guys and how she needs to protect her and her daughter makes it a timeless, revolutionary movie in my opinion. a+. For the relatively low budget at the time in 1996 this movie is a modern masterpiece in my opinion and since almost 20 years no one has even dared to replicate such subject matter and plot on the big screen.

    Good lord, this movie abuses every conceivable clich&eacute; possible. Imagine a movie about strippers. These strippers are different because they're naive, put upon, victims being forced to degrade themselves for icky men against their will. None of them are just whores or anything, and all of them, especially our heroine, have angelic hearts of gold. They are protected by large African American guardian "Shad". The plot centers around "Erin", played by Demi Moore, who was an FBI secretary until her husband's misbehavior got her fired and caused the dissolution of their marriage and an ensuing custody battle. The husband is not a great guy, as you can imagine, and takes their child, who is so un-important as a character that I can't remember her name, and engages in a wheelchair theft scam. Unable to win custody through legal means as a result of her occupation as a stripper, Erin illegally abducts the child. An elderly congressmen attempts to recruit Erin into his harem, using knowledge of the illegal abduction as leverage. You can pretty much use your imagination for everything that happens next. From here, the clich&eacute; abuse continues as it becomes a foregone conclusion that Erin is a near perfect mother and there is never any meaningfully developed conflict about her struggle raising a child given her choice of occupation. Just a stripper who's a great human being on the inside warring against her victimizers. The acting is horrendous, the characters are flat, the plot is predictable and contrived. And on top of this, despite being a movie about strippers, it was completely unsexy and un-arousing in any manner. The only thing that saves this from being a 1/10 are unintentionally comedic non-sequitors. The horrific and one dimensional portrayal of the congressman, for instance, crossed into strangely amusing territory at times, and something similar happens with Erin's ex-husband.

    Striptease is about a stripper who becomes involved in both a child- custody dispute and corrupt politics.It is a sex comedy film directed, produced, and written by Andrew Bergman. The film stars Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds, and Ving Rhames. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Carl Hiaasen. The screenplay,based on a satirical novel, tells the story of Erin, who has just gotten a divorce from Darrell, the sleazy ex-con she foolishly married. However, the judge's memories of Darrell's days as a football hero win him custody of their daughter, and Erin, concerned for her child's safety, is determined to fight the decision. Erin has just lost her position as a secretary for the FBI, so, to cover her legal bills, she takes a job as an exotic dancer at a strip club called the Eager Beaver. While she has no experience taking off her clothes in front of an audience, Erin soon makes friends with the fellow dancers and finds a protector in the club's burly but good-hearted bouncer, Shad. She also makes a few fans among the regulars at the club, most notably David Dillbeck, a drunken lout with a bottomless appetite for sleaze -- who also happens to be a conservative congressman with ties to right-wing religious groups. One of Erin's admirers snaps a photo of her with the congressman when a brawl breaks out at the club, and he suggests that it would make fine blackmail material. However, when the man with the photo turns up dead, Erin discovers that Dillbeck's people play a bit rougher than she expected. This movie showcases nothing but Demi Moore's star appeal and sexy body.Nothing more.Andrew Bergman's screenplay and storyline was a complete mess.Personally,I do believe that this movie,Striptease together with G.I. Jane,practically placed Moore's stardom into a downhill and it never recovered since then.She could have been a better actress had she chosen better materials after attaining popularity in Ghost instead of going for the high paycheck that movie offers come her way that does nothing except use her star appeal rather than her showcase her acting ability.

    While Andrew Bergman's adaptation fails to capture the essence of Carl Hiaasen's satirical novel it nevertheless is nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests. Demi Moore, whose career was already on a downward slide judging by the number of times she bares her breasts, plays a mother who is forced to work in a strip joint to earn the income necessary to fight for custody of her daughter, the care of whom a condescending judge has awarded to her low-life husband (Robert Patrick). While on the job, she catches the eye of a sleazy senator (Burt Reynolds) who is prepared to go to any odds to have her perform a private dance. While it's fair to say that the film completely botches the satirical aspects of Hiaasen's story, it still manages to provide an absorbing story after an undeniably shaky start. The nudity isn't as in your face as you'd expect, and in fact becomes almost incidental as the story moves along. The cast are all reasonably good, with Reynolds and Patrick in particular standing out: Reynold's character could have been something of a classic had it been toned down a little  although he's still likable in a sleazy sort of way, he's just too downright weird for the audience to take to him completely. Patrick's low-life husband is also likable despite his failings and Patrick works hard to make him this way. His drunken intrusion into the senator's long-awaited private dance with a cheery 'evenin' party-goers' is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. Ving Rhames also scores as an outwardly surly bouncer with a soft spot for all the girls in his charge. I suppose in a way, Striptease has something of an advantage due to its reputation: you come into it expecting very little, so the fact that it's got an engrossing  if far-fetched plot  works in its favour. Worth a try if you're in the mood.

    Its just a straight up guy movie. No intricate plot. Just stripping. Demi Moore has an excellent body, considering she was a mother at the time, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's just a movie for perverted men, but that doesn't mean it can't be funny and worth watching. Ving Rhames plays his character well making him hilarious and interesting. I've only seen the original but it makes me wonder how much extra could be in the unrated version. Hopefully that'll be really worth a watch. Just from the title of the movie you keep waiting to see her perfectly sculpted body but you have to wait through a few strip scenes before you get to see her breasts.

    Ousted from her CIA job Erin takes her new breasts and serious expression over to a strip club called the 'Eager Beaver' to work as a stripper (I don't think dancers take their clothes off) to earn enough money to gain custody of her daughter. Ironic really as the cost of her boob job would probably have paid for the custody battle. The central character of Erin is played by Demi Moore who seems to have taken the role to show off the talents of her plastic surgeon; but sadly displayed little talent of her own. This is the films major downfall as the other actors are fine (especially Burt), but Demi's character does not gain any particular sympathy as she is alternately intense, reproving, frowning, stern, serious and then back to intense again. "Even with a great body you can be a serious actor" she seems to be saying. In short, Demi was boring and I really did not care whether she won or not. Demi does have a great bod, but personally I find her strangely sexless and preferred any of the other women she worked with. Burt also seems to be the type that would have gone for the blond with the huge breasts rather than the antiseptic Ms Moore. I know I did.

    As with most comments I'd imagine Carl Hiassen is fairly annoyed. I've read most of his books, and they are riotously funny and extremely inventive. Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

    This movie tries to tell the story of a desperate mother fighting for her daughter, but forgets that plot usually doesn't involve awful comedy skits. The mix really doesn't work, and the clash between Demi Moore's overly serious acting and Burt Reynolds' whatever the hell Burt Reynolds was doing couldn't be more off-putting. The boat scenes, dear God the boat scenes, the memory just won't go away. That's what I call nightmare fuel. Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames are also in this movie, which I guess makes it a bit cooler than it deserves to be. Their characters aren't interesting in the slightest, but hey, they're still Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. As well as pretty much every other aspect from this weak, overlong movie, I really hated the climax. If that's the best solution you can come up with, you might want to consider not making movies. This movie may not be as bad as "Showgirls", but it's also one hell of a lot less entertaining.

    The Good: VING RHAMES - I suspect the only actor who actually bothered to read the book. He had just the right mixture of menace and ineptitude; so much so that I forgot that when I read the book I'd assumed his character was white (I don't think his colour is explicitly stated); RENA RIFFEL - a truly gorgeous and sadly overlooked starlet (who was also in the oft-mentioned 'Showgirls'); underused, but looking her delicious best. The Bad: How Carl Hiaason must feel. The Truly Atrocious: Just about everything else, from hammy Bert to drammy Demi; and Pandora Peaks proving that porn-stars should not be given anything as difficult as lines. I also read somewhere that Demi Moore had "artistic"(?) control over the character of Erin written into her contract; well, this is the result - a confused and toothless adaptation of a wonderfully raunchy (and *funny*) book. Andrew Bergman doesn't show anything in his IMDb log for seven years after he penned this turkey...and it serves him right. The Lesson: Don't let the inmates take over the asylum. My vote: 3/10 for Ving and Rena alone.

"Even with a great body you can be a serious actor" she seems to be saying. In short, Demi was boring and I really did not care whether she won or not. Demi does have a great bod, but personally I find her strangely sexless and preferred any of the other women she worked with. Burt also seems to be the type that would have gone for the blond with the huge breasts rather than the antiseptic Ms Moore. I know I did.

    As with most comments I'd imagine Carl Hiassen is fairly annoyed. I've read most of his books, and they are riotously funny and extremely inventive. Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

    This movie tries to tell the story of a desperate mother fighting for her daughter, but forgets that plot usually doesn't involve awful comedy skits. The mix really doesn't work, and the clash between Demi Moore's overly serious acting and Burt Reynolds' whatever the hell Burt Reynolds was doing couldn't be more off-putting. The boat scenes, dear God the boat scenes, the memory just won't go away. That's what I call nightmare fuel. Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames are also in this movie, which I guess makes it a bit cooler than it deserves to be. Their characters aren't interesting in the slightest, but hey, they're still Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. As well as pretty much every other aspect from this weak, overlong movie, I really hated the climax. If that's the best solution you can come up with, you might want to consider not making movies. This movie may not be as bad as "Showgirls", but it's also one hell of a lot less entertaining.

    The Good: VING RHAMES - I suspect the only actor who actually bothered to read the book. He had just the right mixture of menace and ineptitude; so much so that I forgot that when I read the book I'd assumed his character was white (I don't think his colour is explicitly stated); RENA RIFFEL - a truly gorgeous and sadly overlooked starlet (who was also in the oft-mentioned 'Showgirls'); underused, but looking her delicious best. The Bad: How Carl Hiaason must feel. The Truly Atrocious: Just about everything else, from hammy Bert to drammy Demi; and Pandora Peaks proving that porn-stars should not be given anything as difficult as lines. I also read somewhere that Demi Moore had "artistic"(?) control over the character of Erin written into her contract; well, this is the result - a confused and toothless adaptation of a wonderfully raunchy (and *funny*) book. Andrew Bergman doesn't show anything in his IMDb log for seven years after he penned this turkey...and it serves him right. The Lesson: Don't let the inmates take over the asylum. My vote: 3/10 for Ving and Rena alone.

    I was cruising through my movie channels and I saw that Striptease was playing, I remember seeing the trailer for this movie back in 1994 when I was a kid and wanted to see it, oh, my parents had to forbid it. But of course since I'm 23 and on my own, I think I was allowed to view it. I kinda wish now that I had my parents here to tell me no because this movie was really bad. I mean most people make fun of Showgirls, I mean yeah, it's understandable, but at least that had personality and more memorable moments than this. Demi Moore just strips down to some really depressing music and this movie has the strangest humor in the world. I could see how some people might get a kick out of it, but over all it just a bad movie, it has no zest and nothing to make it special. A story about a stripper... OK, here it goes. The film revolves around Erin Grant, a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favor. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from her negligent husband. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much information. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. Demi is alright in the movie, if even that, I'm being pretty generous considering she let her daughter, Rumor, act as her daughter in this movie. If I were Rumor, I'd be like "next time, I pick the mother/daughter bonding event". I wouldn't really feel like watching my mother dance around naked for men nore a camera. Well Rumor must have gotten a huge raise in her allowance for that to happen. But anyways, I wouldn't recommend Striptease, it was a sleazy movie, I would even go as far to say that if you want sleaze, go for Showgirls, it's more fun to watch and make fun of, this was just a sad movie. 1/10

    Woa I remember when I thought this e-Striptease movie starring Demi Moore was trashy and obscene back then.... now it's actually more prude that the usual music video on MTV. Demi Moore gave her 100% in the stripper character and wasn't afraid of breaking new grounds and offending people in 1996. This is a recipe for success, just like Madonna did for the entire lifetime of her career. I love especially the scene where she stripteases from a cabaret costume with the fedora hat. Hot! And all this plot about the gangster guys and how she needs to protect her and her daughter makes it a timeless, revolutionary movie in my opinion. a+. For the relatively low budget at the time in 1996 this movie is a modern masterpiece in my opinion and since almost 20 years no one has even dared to replicate such subject matter and plot on the big screen.

    Good lord, this movie abuses every conceivable clich&eacute; possible. Imagine a movie about strippers. These strippers are different because they're naive, put upon, victims being forced to degrade themselves for icky men against their will. None of them are just whores or anything, and all of them, especially our heroine, have angelic hearts of gold. They are protected by large African American guardian "Shad". The plot centers around "Erin", played by Demi Moore, who was an FBI secretary until her husband's misbehavior got her fired and caused the dissolution of their marriage and an ensuing custody battle. The husband is not a great guy, as you can imagine, and takes their child, who is so un-important as a character that I can't remember her name, and engages in a wheelchair theft scam. Unable to win custody through legal means as a result of her occupation as a stripper, Erin illegally abducts the child. An elderly congressmen attempts to recruit Erin into his harem, using knowledge of the illegal abduction as leverage. You can pretty much use your imagination for everything that happens next. From here, the clich&eacute; abuse continues as it becomes a foregone conclusion that Erin is a near perfect mother and there is never any meaningfully developed conflict about her struggle raising a child given her choice of occupation. Just a stripper who's a great human being on the inside warring against her victimizers. The acting is horrendous, the characters are flat, the plot is predictable and contrived. And on top of this, despite being a movie about strippers, it was completely unsexy and un-arousing in any manner. The only thing that saves this from being a 1/10 are unintentionally comedic non-sequitors. The horrific and one dimensional portrayal of the congressman, for instance, crossed into strangely amusing territory at times, and something similar happens with Erin's ex-husband.

    Striptease is about a stripper who becomes involved in both a child- custody dispute and corrupt politics.It is a sex comedy film directed, produced, and written by Andrew Bergman. The film stars Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds, and Ving Rhames. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Carl Hiaasen. The screenplay,based on a satirical novel, tells the story of Erin, who has just gotten a divorce from Darrell, the sleazy ex-con she foolishly married. However, the judge's memories of Darrell's days as a football hero win him custody of their daughter, and Erin, concerned for her child's safety, is determined to fight the decision. Erin has just lost her position as a secretary for the FBI, so, to cover her legal bills, she takes a job as an exotic dancer at a strip club called the Eager Beaver. While she has no experience taking off her clothes in front of an audience, Erin soon makes friends with the fellow dancers and finds a protector in the club's burly but good-hearted bouncer, Shad. She also makes a few fans among the regulars at the club, most notably David Dillbeck, a drunken lout with a bottomless appetite for sleaze -- who also happens to be a conservative congressman with ties to right-wing religious groups. One of Erin's admirers snaps a photo of her with the congressman when a brawl breaks out at the club, and he suggests that it would make fine blackmail material. However, when the man with the photo turns up dead, Erin discovers that Dillbeck's people play a bit rougher than she expected. This movie showcases nothing but Demi Moore's star appeal and sexy body.Nothing more.Andrew Bergman's screenplay and storyline was a complete mess.Personally,I do believe that this movie,Striptease together with G.I. Jane,practically placed Moore's stardom into a downhill and it never recovered since then.She could have been a better actress had she chosen better materials after attaining popularity in Ghost instead of going for the high paycheck that movie offers come her way that does nothing except use her star appeal rather than her showcase her acting ability.

    While Andrew Bergman's adaptation fails to capture the essence of Carl Hiaasen's satirical novel it nevertheless is nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests. Demi Moore, whose career was already on a downward slide judging by the number of times she bares her breasts, plays a mother who is forced to work in a strip joint to earn the income necessary to fight for custody of her daughter, the care of whom a condescending judge has awarded to her low-life husband (Robert Patrick). While on the job, she catches the eye of a sleazy senator (Burt Reynolds) who is prepared to go to any odds to have her perform a private dance. While it's fair to say that the film completely botches the satirical aspects of Hiaasen's story, it still manages to provide an absorbing story after an undeniably shaky start. The nudity isn't as in your face as you'd expect, and in fact becomes almost incidental as the story moves along. The cast are all reasonably good, with Reynolds and Patrick in particular standing out: Reynold's character could have been something of a classic had it been toned down a little  although he's still likable in a sleazy sort of way, he's just too downright weird for the audience to take to him completely. Patrick's low-life husband is also likable despite his failings and Patrick works hard to make him this way. His drunken intrusion into the senator's long-awaited private dance with a cheery 'evenin' party-goers' is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. Ving Rhames also scores as an outwardly surly bouncer with a soft spot for all the girls in his charge. I suppose in a way, Striptease has something of an advantage due to its reputation: you come into it expecting very little, so the fact that it's got an engrossing  if far-fetched plot  works in its favour. Worth a try if you're in the mood.

    Its just a straight up guy movie. No intricate plot. Just stripping. Demi Moore has an excellent body, considering she was a mother at the time, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's just a movie for perverted men, but that doesn't mean it can't be funny and worth watching. Ving Rhames plays his character well making him hilarious and interesting. I've only seen the original but it makes me wonder how much extra could be in the unrated version. Hopefully that'll be really worth a watch. Just from the title of the movie you keep waiting to see her perfectly sculpted body but you have to wait through a few strip scenes before you get to see her breasts.

    Ousted from her CIA job Erin takes her new breasts and serious expression over to a strip club called the 'Eager Beaver' to work as a stripper (I don't think dancers take their clothes off) to earn enough money to gain custody of her daughter. Ironic really as the cost of her boob job would probably have paid for the custody battle. The central character of Erin is played by Demi Moore who seems to have taken the role to show off the talents of her plastic surgeon; but sadly displayed little talent of her own. This is the films major downfall as the other actors are fine (especially Burt), but Demi's character does not gain any particular sympathy as she is alternately intense, reproving, frowning, stern, serious and then back to intense again. "Even with a great body you can be a serious actor" she seems to be saying. In short, Demi was boring and I really did not care whether she won or not. Demi does have a great bod, but personally I find her strangely sexless and preferred any of the other women she worked with. Burt also seems to be the type that would have gone for the blond with the huge breasts rather than the antiseptic Ms Moore. I know I did.

    As with most comments I'd imagine Carl Hiassen is fairly annoyed. I've read most of his books, and they are riotously funny and extremely inventive. Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

The cast are all reasonably good, with Reynolds and Patrick in particular standing out: Reynold's character could have been something of a classic had it been toned down a little  although he's still likable in a sleazy sort of way, he's just too downright weird for the audience to take to him completely. Patrick's low-life husband is also likable despite his failings and Patrick works hard to make him this way. His drunken intrusion into the senator's long-awaited private dance with a cheery 'evenin' party-goers' is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. Ving Rhames also scores as an outwardly surly bouncer with a soft spot for all the girls in his charge. I suppose in a way, Striptease has something of an advantage due to its reputation: you come into it expecting very little, so the fact that it's got an engrossing  if far-fetched plot  works in its favour. Worth a try if you're in the mood.

    Its just a straight up guy movie. No intricate plot. Just stripping. Demi Moore has an excellent body, considering she was a mother at the time, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's just a movie for perverted men, but that doesn't mean it can't be funny and worth watching. Ving Rhames plays his character well making him hilarious and interesting. I've only seen the original but it makes me wonder how much extra could be in the unrated version. Hopefully that'll be really worth a watch. Just from the title of the movie you keep waiting to see her perfectly sculpted body but you have to wait through a few strip scenes before you get to see her breasts.

    Ousted from her CIA job Erin takes her new breasts and serious expression over to a strip club called the 'Eager Beaver' to work as a stripper (I don't think dancers take their clothes off) to earn enough money to gain custody of her daughter. Ironic really as the cost of her boob job would probably have paid for the custody battle. The central character of Erin is played by Demi Moore who seems to have taken the role to show off the talents of her plastic surgeon; but sadly displayed little talent of her own. This is the films major downfall as the other actors are fine (especially Burt), but Demi's character does not gain any particular sympathy as she is alternately intense, reproving, frowning, stern, serious and then back to intense again. "Even with a great body you can be a serious actor" she seems to be saying. In short, Demi was boring and I really did not care whether she won or not. Demi does have a great bod, but personally I find her strangely sexless and preferred any of the other women she worked with. Burt also seems to be the type that would have gone for the blond with the huge breasts rather than the antiseptic Ms Moore. I know I did.

    As with most comments I'd imagine Carl Hiassen is fairly annoyed. I've read most of his books, and they are riotously funny and extremely inventive. Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

    This movie tries to tell the story of a desperate mother fighting for her daughter, but forgets that plot usually doesn't involve awful comedy skits. The mix really doesn't work, and the clash between Demi Moore's overly serious acting and Burt Reynolds' whatever the hell Burt Reynolds was doing couldn't be more off-putting. The boat scenes, dear God the boat scenes, the memory just won't go away. That's what I call nightmare fuel. Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames are also in this movie, which I guess makes it a bit cooler than it deserves to be. Their characters aren't interesting in the slightest, but hey, they're still Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. As well as pretty much every other aspect from this weak, overlong movie, I really hated the climax. If that's the best solution you can come up with, you might want to consider not making movies. This movie may not be as bad as "Showgirls", but it's also one hell of a lot less entertaining.

    The Good: VING RHAMES - I suspect the only actor who actually bothered to read the book. He had just the right mixture of menace and ineptitude; so much so that I forgot that when I read the book I'd assumed his character was white (I don't think his colour is explicitly stated); RENA RIFFEL - a truly gorgeous and sadly overlooked starlet (who was also in the oft-mentioned 'Showgirls'); underused, but looking her delicious best. The Bad: How Carl Hiaason must feel. The Truly Atrocious: Just about everything else, from hammy Bert to drammy Demi; and Pandora Peaks proving that porn-stars should not be given anything as difficult as lines. I also read somewhere that Demi Moore had "artistic"(?) control over the character of Erin written into her contract; well, this is the result - a confused and toothless adaptation of a wonderfully raunchy (and *funny*) book.

    I was cruising through my movie channels and I saw that Striptease was playing, I remember seeing the trailer for this movie back in 1994 when I was a kid and wanted to see it, oh, my parents had to forbid it. But of course since I'm 23 and on my own, I think I was allowed to view it. I kinda wish now that I had my parents here to tell me no because this movie was really bad. I mean most people make fun of Showgirls, I mean yeah, it's understandable, but at least that had personality and more memorable moments than this. Demi Moore just strips down to some really depressing music and this movie has the strangest humor in the world. I could see how some people might get a kick out of it, but over all it just a bad movie, it has no zest and nothing to make it special. A story about a stripper... OK, here it goes. The film revolves around Erin Grant, a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favor. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from her negligent husband. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much information. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. Demi is alright in the movie, if even that, I'm being pretty generous considering she let her daughter, Rumor, act as her daughter in this movie. If I were Rumor, I'd be like "next time, I pick the mother/daughter bonding event". I wouldn't really feel like watching my mother dance around naked for men nore a camera. Well Rumor must have gotten a huge raise in her allowance for that to happen. But anyways, I wouldn't recommend Striptease, it was a sleazy movie, I would even go as far to say that if you want sleaze, go for Showgirls, it's more fun to watch and make fun of, this was just a sad movie. 1/10

    Woa I remember when I thought this e-Striptease movie starring Demi Moore was trashy and obscene back then.... now it's actually more prude that the usual music video on MTV. Demi Moore gave her 100% in the stripper character and wasn't afraid of breaking new grounds and offending people in 1996. This is a recipe for success, just like Madonna did for the entire lifetime of her career. I love especially the scene where she stripteases from a cabaret costume with the fedora hat. Hot! And all this plot about the gangster guys and how she needs to protect her and her daughter makes it a timeless, revolutionary movie in my opinion. a+. For the relatively low budget at the time in 1996 this movie is a modern masterpiece in my opinion and since almost 20 years no one has even dared to replicate such subject matter and plot on the big screen.

    Good lord, this movie abuses every conceivable clich&eacute; possible. Imagine a movie about strippers. These strippers are different because they're naive, put upon, victims being forced to degrade themselves for icky men against their will. None of them are just whores or anything, and all of them, especially our heroine, have angelic hearts of gold. They are protected by large African American guardian "Shad". The plot centers around "Erin", played by Demi Moore, who was an FBI secretary until her husband's misbehavior got her fired and caused the dissolution of their marriage and an ensuing custody battle. The husband is not a great guy, as you can imagine, and takes their child, who is so un-important as a character that I can't remember her name, and engages in a wheelchair theft scam. Unable to win custody through legal means as a result of her occupation as a stripper, Erin illegally abducts the child. An elderly congressmen attempts to recruit Erin into his harem, using knowledge of the illegal abduction as leverage. You can pretty much use your imagination for everything that happens next. From here, the clich&eacute; abuse continues as it becomes a foregone conclusion that Erin is a near perfect mother and there is never any meaningfully developed conflict about her struggle raising a child given her choice of occupation. Just a stripper who's a great human being on the inside warring against her victimizers. The acting is horrendous, the characters are flat, the plot is predictable and contrived. And on top of this, despite being a movie about strippers, it was completely unsexy and un-arousing in any manner. The only thing that saves this from being a 1/10 are unintentionally comedic non-sequitors. The horrific and one dimensional portrayal of the congressman, for instance, crossed into strangely amusing territory at times, and something similar happens with Erin's ex-husband.

    Striptease is about a stripper who becomes involved in both a child- custody dispute and corrupt politics.It is a sex comedy film directed, produced, and written by Andrew Bergman. The film stars Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds, and Ving Rhames. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Carl Hiaasen. The screenplay,based on a satirical novel, tells the story of Erin, who has just gotten a divorce from Darrell, the sleazy ex-con she foolishly married. However, the judge's memories of Darrell's days as a football hero win him custody of their daughter, and Erin, concerned for her child's safety, is determined to fight the decision. Erin has just lost her position as a secretary for the FBI, so, to cover her legal bills, she takes a job as an exotic dancer at a strip club called the Eager Beaver. While she has no experience taking off her clothes in front of an audience, Erin soon makes friends with the fellow dancers and finds a protector in the club's burly but good-hearted bouncer, Shad. She also makes a few fans among the regulars at the club, most notably David Dillbeck, a drunken lout with a bottomless appetite for sleaze -- who also happens to be a conservative congressman with ties to right-wing religious groups. One of Erin's admirers snaps a photo of her with the congressman when a brawl breaks out at the club, and he suggests that it would make fine blackmail material. However, when the man with the photo turns up dead, Erin discovers that Dillbeck's people play a bit rougher than she expected. This movie showcases nothing but Demi Moore's star appeal and sexy body.Nothing more.Andrew Bergman's screenplay and storyline was a complete mess.Personally,I do believe that this movie,Striptease together with G.I. Jane,practically placed Moore's stardom into a downhill and it never recovered since then.She could have been a better actress had she chosen better materials after attaining popularity in Ghost instead of going for the high paycheck that movie offers come her way that does nothing except use her star appeal rather than her showcase her acting ability.

    While Andrew Bergman's adaptation fails to capture the essence of Carl Hiaasen's satirical novel it nevertheless is nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests. Demi Moore, whose career was already on a downward slide judging by the number of times she bares her breasts, plays a mother who is forced to work in a strip joint to earn the income necessary to fight for custody of her daughter, the care of whom a condescending judge has awarded to her low-life husband (Robert Patrick). While on the job, she catches the eye of a sleazy senator (Burt Reynolds) who is prepared to go to any odds to have her perform a private dance. While it's fair to say that the film completely botches the satirical aspects of Hiaasen's story, it still manages to provide an absorbing story after an undeniably shaky start. The nudity isn't as in your face as you'd expect, and in fact becomes almost incidental as the story moves along. The cast are all reasonably good, with Reynolds and Patrick in particular standing out: Reynold's character could have been something of a classic had it been toned down a little  although he's still likable in a sleazy sort of way, he's just too downright weird for the audience to take to him completely. Patrick's low-life husband is also likable despite his failings and Patrick works hard to make him this way. His drunken intrusion into the senator's long-awaited private dance with a cheery 'evenin' party-goers' is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. Ving Rhames also scores as an outwardly surly bouncer with a soft spot for all the girls in his charge. I suppose in a way, Striptease has something of an advantage due to its reputation: you come into it expecting very little, so the fact that it's got an engrossing  if far-fetched plot  works in its favour. Worth a try if you're in the mood.

    As with most comments I'd imagine Carl Hiassen is fairly annoyed. I've read most of his books, and they are riotously funny and extremely inventive. Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

The film stars Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds, and Ving Rhames. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Carl Hiaasen. The screenplay,based on a satirical novel, tells the story of Erin, who has just gotten a divorce from Darrell, the sleazy ex-con she foolishly married. However, the judge's memories of Darrell's days as a football hero win him custody of their daughter, and Erin, concerned for her child's safety, is determined to fight the decision. Erin has just lost her position as a secretary for the FBI, so, to cover her legal bills, she takes a job as an exotic dancer at a strip club called the Eager Beaver. While she has no experience taking off her clothes in front of an audience, Erin soon makes friends with the fellow dancers and finds a protector in the club's burly but good-hearted bouncer, Shad. She also makes a few fans among the regulars at the club, most notably David Dillbeck, a drunken lout with a bottomless appetite for sleaze -- who also happens to be a conservative congressman with ties to right-wing religious groups. One of Erin's admirers snaps a photo of her with the congressman when a brawl breaks out at the club, and he suggests that it would make fine blackmail material. However, when the man with the photo turns up dead, Erin discovers that Dillbeck's people play a bit rougher than she expected. This movie showcases nothing but Demi Moore's star appeal and sexy body.Nothing more.Andrew Bergman's screenplay and storyline was a complete mess.Personally,I do believe that this movie,Striptease together with G.I. Jane,practically placed Moore's stardom into a downhill and it never recovered since then.She could have been a better actress had she chosen better materials after attaining popularity in Ghost instead of going for the high paycheck that movie offers come her way that does nothing except use her star appeal rather than her showcase her acting ability.

    While Andrew Bergman's adaptation fails to capture the essence of Carl Hiaasen's satirical novel it nevertheless is nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests. Demi Moore, whose career was already on a downward slide judging by the number of times she bares her breasts, plays a mother who is forced to work in a strip joint to earn the income necessary to fight for custody of her daughter, the care of whom a condescending judge has awarded to her low-life husband (Robert Patrick). While on the job, she catches the eye of a sleazy senator (Burt Reynolds) who is prepared to go to any odds to have her perform a private dance. While it's fair to say that the film completely botches the satirical aspects of Hiaasen's story, it still manages to provide an absorbing story after an undeniably shaky start. The nudity isn't as in your face as you'd expect, and in fact becomes almost incidental as the story moves along. The cast are all reasonably good, with Reynolds and Patrick in particular standing out: Reynold's character could have been something of a classic had it been toned down a little  although he's still likable in a sleazy sort of way, he's just too downright weird for the audience to take to him completely. Patrick's low-life husband is also likable despite his failings and Patrick works hard to make him this way. His drunken intrusion into the senator's long-awaited private dance with a cheery 'evenin' party-goers' is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. Ving Rhames also scores as an outwardly surly bouncer with a soft spot for all the girls in his charge. I suppose in a way, Striptease has something of an advantage due to its reputation: you come into it expecting very little, so the fact that it's got an engrossing  if far-fetched plot  works in its favour. Worth a try if you're in the mood.

    Its just a straight up guy movie. No intricate plot. Just stripping. Demi Moore has an excellent body, considering she was a mother at the time, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's just a movie for perverted men, but that doesn't mean it can't be funny and worth watching. Ving Rhames plays his character well making him hilarious and interesting. I've only seen the original but it makes me wonder how much extra could be in the unrated version. Hopefully that'll be really worth a watch. Just from the title of the movie you keep waiting to see her perfectly sculpted body but you have to wait through a few strip scenes before you get to see her breasts.

    Ousted from her CIA job Erin takes her new breasts and serious expression over to a strip club called the 'Eager Beaver' to work as a stripper (I don't think dancers take their clothes off) to earn enough money to gain custody of her daughter. Ironic really as the cost of her boob job would probably have paid for the custody battle. The central character of Erin is played by Demi Moore who seems to have taken the role to show off the talents of her plastic surgeon; but sadly displayed little talent of her own. This is the films major downfall as the other actors are fine (especially Burt), but Demi's character does not gain any particular sympathy as she is alternately intense, reproving, frowning, stern, serious and then back to intense again. "Even with a great body you can be a serious actor" she seems to be saying. In short, Demi was boring and I really did not care whether she won or not. Demi does have a great bod, but personally I find her strangely sexless and preferred any of the other women she worked with. Burt also seems to be the type that would have gone for the blond with the huge breasts rather than the antiseptic Ms Moore. I know I did.

    As with most comments I'd imagine Carl Hiassen is fairly annoyed. I've read most of his books, and they are riotously funny and extremely inventive. Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

    This movie tries to tell the story of a desperate mother fighting for her daughter, but forgets that plot usually doesn't involve awful comedy skits. The mix really doesn't work, and the clash between Demi Moore's overly serious acting and Burt Reynolds' whatever the hell Burt Reynolds was doing couldn't be more off-putting. The boat scenes, dear God the boat scenes, the memory just won't go away. That's what I call nightmare fuel. Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames are also in this movie, which I guess makes it a bit cooler than it deserves to be. Their characters aren't interesting in the slightest, but hey, they're still Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. As well as pretty much every other aspect from this weak, overlong movie, I really hated the climax. If that's the best solution you can come up with, you might want to consider not making movies. This movie may not be as bad as "Showgirls", but it's also one hell of a lot less entertaining.

He had just the right mixture of menace and ineptitude; so much so that I forgot that when I read the book I'd assumed his character was white (I don't think his colour is explicitly stated); RENA RIFFEL - a truly gorgeous and sadly overlooked starlet (who was also in the oft-mentioned 'Showgirls'); underused, but looking her delicious best. The Bad: How Carl Hiaason must feel. The Truly Atrocious: Just about everything else, from hammy Bert to drammy Demi; and Pandora Peaks proving that porn-stars should not be given anything as difficult as lines. I also read somewhere that Demi Moore had "artistic"(?) control over the character of Erin written into her contract; well, this is the result - a confused and toothless adaptation of a wonderfully raunchy (and *funny*) book.

    I was cruising through my movie channels and I saw that Striptease was playing, I remember seeing the trailer for this movie back in 1994 when I was a kid and wanted to see it, oh, my parents had to forbid it. But of course since I'm 23 and on my own, I think I was allowed to view it. I kinda wish now that I had my parents here to tell me no because this movie was really bad. I mean most people make fun of Showgirls, I mean yeah, it's understandable, but at least that had personality and more memorable moments than this. Demi Moore just strips down to some really depressing music and this movie has the strangest humor in the world. I could see how some people might get a kick out of it, but over all it just a bad movie, it has no zest and nothing to make it special. A story about a stripper... OK, here it goes. The film revolves around Erin Grant, a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favor. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from her negligent husband. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much information. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. Demi is alright in the movie, if even that, I'm being pretty generous considering she let her daughter, Rumor, act as her daughter in this movie. If I were Rumor, I'd be like "next time, I pick the mother/daughter bonding event". I wouldn't really feel like watching my mother dance around naked for men nore a camera. Well Rumor must have gotten a huge raise in her allowance for that to happen. But anyways, I wouldn't recommend Striptease, it was a sleazy movie, I would even go as far to say that if you want sleaze, go for Showgirls, it's more fun to watch and make fun of, this was just a sad movie. 1/10

    Woa I remember when I thought this e-Striptease movie starring Demi Moore was trashy and obscene back then.... now it's actually more prude that the usual music video on MTV. Demi Moore gave her 100% in the stripper character and wasn't afraid of breaking new grounds and offending people in 1996. This is a recipe for success, just like Madonna did for the entire lifetime of her career. I love especially the scene where she stripteases from a cabaret costume with the fedora hat. Hot! And all this plot about the gangster guys and how she needs to protect her and her daughter makes it a timeless, revolutionary movie in my opinion. a+. For the relatively low budget at the time in 1996 this movie is a modern masterpiece in my opinion and since almost 20 years no one has even dared to replicate such subject matter and plot on the big screen.

    Good lord, this movie abuses every conceivable clich&eacute; possible. Imagine a movie about strippers. These strippers are different because they're naive, put upon, victims being forced to degrade themselves for icky men against their will. None of them are just whores or anything, and all of them, especially our heroine, have angelic hearts of gold. They are protected by large African American guardian "Shad". The plot centers around "Erin", played by Demi Moore, who was an FBI secretary until her husband's misbehavior got her fired and caused the dissolution of their marriage and an ensuing custody battle. The husband is not a great guy, as you can imagine, and takes their child, who is so un-important as a character that I can't remember her name, and engages in a wheelchair theft scam. Unable to win custody through legal means as a result of her occupation as a stripper, Erin illegally abducts the child. An elderly congressmen attempts to recruit Erin into his harem, using knowledge of the illegal abduction as leverage. You can pretty much use your imagination for everything that happens next. From here, the clich&eacute; abuse continues as it becomes a foregone conclusion that Erin is a near perfect mother and there is never any meaningfully developed conflict about her struggle raising a child given her choice of occupation. Just a stripper who's a great human being on the inside warring against her victimizers. The acting is horrendous, the characters are flat, the plot is predictable and contrived. And on top of this, despite being a movie about strippers, it was completely unsexy and un-arousing in any manner. The only thing that saves this from being a 1/10 are unintentionally comedic non-sequitors. The horrific and one dimensional portrayal of the congressman, for instance, crossed into strangely amusing territory at times, and something similar happens with Erin's ex-husband.

Demi Moore, whose career was already on a downward slide judging by the number of times she bares her breasts, plays a mother who is forced to work in a strip joint to earn the income necessary to fight for custody of her daughter, the care of whom a condescending judge has awarded to her low-life husband (Robert Patrick).

    As with most comments I'd imagine Carl Hiassen is fairly annoyed. I've read most of his books, and they are riotously funny and extremely inventive. Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

For the relatively low budget at the time in 1996 this movie is a modern masterpiece in my opinion and since almost 20 years no one has even dared to replicate such subject matter and plot on the big screen.

    Good lord, this movie abuses every conceivable clich&eacute; possible. Imagine a movie about strippers. These strippers are different because they're naive, put upon, victims being forced to degrade themselves for icky men against their will. None of them are just whores or anything, and all of them, especially our heroine, have angelic hearts of gold. They are protected by large African American guardian "Shad". The plot centers around "Erin", played by Demi Moore, who was an FBI secretary until her husband's misbehavior got her fired and caused the dissolution of their marriage and an ensuing custody battle. The husband is not a great guy, as you can imagine, and takes their child, who is so un-important as a character that I can't remember her name, and engages in a wheelchair theft scam. Unable to win custody through legal means as a result of her occupation as a stripper, Erin illegally abducts the child. An elderly congressmen attempts to recruit Erin into his harem, using knowledge of the illegal abduction as leverage. You can pretty much use your imagination for everything that happens next. From here, the clich&eacute; abuse continues as it becomes a foregone conclusion that Erin is a near perfect mother and there is never any meaningfully developed conflict about her struggle raising a child given her choice of occupation. Just a stripper who's a great human being on the inside warring against her victimizers. The acting is horrendous, the characters are flat, the plot is predictable and contrived. And on top of this, despite being a movie about strippers, it was completely unsexy and un-arousing in any manner. The only thing that saves this from being a 1/10 are unintentionally comedic non-sequitors. The horrific and one dimensional portrayal of the congressman, for instance, crossed into strangely amusing territory at times, and something similar happens with Erin's ex-husband.

    Striptease is about a stripper who becomes involved in both a child- custody dispute and corrupt politics.It is a sex comedy film directed, produced, and written by Andrew Bergman. The film stars Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds, and Ving Rhames. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Carl Hiaasen. The screenplay,based on a satirical novel, tells the story of Erin, who has just gotten a divorce from Darrell, the sleazy ex-con she foolishly married. However, the judge's memories of Darrell's days as a football hero win him custody of their daughter, and Erin, concerned for her child's safety, is determined to fight the decision. Erin has just lost her position as a secretary for the FBI, so, to cover her legal bills, she takes a job as an exotic dancer at a strip club called the Eager Beaver. While she has no experience taking off her clothes in front of an audience, Erin soon makes friends with the fellow dancers and finds a protector in the club's burly but good-hearted bouncer, Shad. She also makes a few fans among the regulars at the club, most notably David Dillbeck, a drunken lout with a bottomless appetite for sleaze -- who also happens to be a conservative congressman with ties to right-wing religious groups. One of Erin's admirers snaps a photo of her with the congressman when a brawl breaks out at the club, and he suggests that it would make fine blackmail material. However, when the man with the photo turns up dead, Erin discovers that Dillbeck's people play a bit rougher than she expected. This movie showcases nothing but Demi Moore's star appeal and sexy body.Nothing more.Andrew Bergman's screenplay and storyline was a complete mess.Personally,I do believe that this movie,Striptease together with G.I. Jane,practically placed Moore's stardom into a downhill and it never recovered since then.She could have been a better actress had she chosen better materials after attaining popularity in Ghost instead of going for the high paycheck that movie offers come her way that does nothing except use her star appeal rather than her showcase her acting ability.

    While Andrew Bergman's adaptation fails to capture the essence of Carl Hiaasen's satirical novel it nevertheless is nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests. Demi Moore, whose career was already on a downward slide judging by the number of times she bares her breasts, plays a mother who is forced to work in a strip joint to earn the income necessary to fight for custody of her daughter, the care of whom a condescending judge has awarded to her low-life husband (Robert Patrick). While on the job, she catches the eye of a sleazy senator (Burt Reynolds) who is prepared to go to any odds to have her perform a private dance. While it's fair to say that the film completely botches the satirical aspects of Hiaasen's story, it still manages to provide an absorbing story after an undeniably shaky start. The nudity isn't as in your face as you'd expect, and in fact becomes almost incidental as the story moves along. The cast are all reasonably good, with Reynolds and Patrick in particular standing out: Reynold's character could have been something of a classic had it been toned down a little  although he's still likable in a sleazy sort of way, he's just too downright weird for the audience to take to him completely. Patrick's low-life husband is also likable despite his failings and Patrick works hard to make him this way. His drunken intrusion into the senator's long-awaited private dance with a cheery 'evenin' party-goers' is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. Ving Rhames also scores as an outwardly surly bouncer with a soft spot for all the girls in his charge. I suppose in a way, Striptease has something of an advantage due to its reputation: you come into it expecting very little, so the fact that it's got an engrossing  if far-fetched plot  works in its favour. Worth a try if you're in the mood.

    Its just a straight up guy movie. No intricate plot. Just stripping. Demi Moore has an excellent body, considering she was a mother at the time, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's just a movie for perverted men, but that doesn't mean it can't be funny and worth watching. Ving Rhames plays his character well making him hilarious and interesting. I've only seen the original but it makes me wonder how much extra could be in the unrated version. Hopefully that'll be really worth a watch. Just from the title of the movie you keep waiting to see her perfectly sculpted body but you have to wait through a few strip scenes before you get to see her breasts.

    Ousted from her CIA job Erin takes her new breasts and serious expression over to a strip club called the 'Eager Beaver' to work as a stripper (I don't think dancers take their clothes off) to earn enough money to gain custody of her daughter. Ironic really as the cost of her boob job would probably have paid for the custody battle. The central character of Erin is played by Demi Moore who seems to have taken the role to show off the talents of her plastic surgeon; but sadly displayed little talent of her own. This is the films major downfall as the other actors are fine (especially Burt), but Demi's character does not gain any particular sympathy as she is alternately intense, reproving, frowning, stern, serious and then back to intense again. "Even with a great body you can be a serious actor" she seems to be saying. In short, Demi was boring and I really did not care whether she won or not. Demi does have a great bod, but personally I find her strangely sexless and preferred any of the other women she worked with. Burt also seems to be the type that would have gone for the blond with the huge breasts rather than the antiseptic Ms Moore. I know I did.

    As with most comments I'd imagine Carl Hiassen is fairly annoyed. I've read most of his books, and they are riotously funny and extremely inventive. Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour. The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway. Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was. And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment. No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film. It's a slightly guilty pleasure, and the only loser is Carl Hiassen as his humour didn't shine through.

    This movie tries to tell the story of a desperate mother fighting for her daughter, but forgets that plot usually doesn't involve awful comedy skits. The mix really doesn't work, and the clash between Demi Moore's overly serious acting and Burt Reynolds' whatever the hell Burt Reynolds was doing couldn't be more off-putting. The boat scenes, dear God the boat scenes, the memory just won't go away. That's what I call nightmare fuel. Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames are also in this movie, which I guess makes it a bit cooler than it deserves to be. Their characters aren't interesting in the slightest, but hey, they're still Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. As well as pretty much every other aspect from this weak, overlong movie, I really hated the climax. If that's the best solution you can come up with, you might want to consider not making movies. This movie may not be as bad as "Showgirls", but it's also one hell of a lot less entertaining.

    The Good: VING RHAMES - I suspect the only actor who actually bothered to read the book. He had just the right mixture of menace and ineptitude; so much so that I forgot that when I read the book I'd assumed his character was white (I don't think his colour is explicitly stated); RENA RIFFEL - a truly gorgeous and sadly overlooked starlet (who was also in the oft-mentioned 'Showgirls'); underused, but looking her delicious best. The Bad: How Carl Hiaason must feel. The Truly Atrocious: Just about everything else, from hammy Bert to drammy Demi; and Pandora Peaks proving that porn-stars should not be given anything as difficult as lines. I also read somewhere that Demi Moore had "artistic"(?) control over the character of Erin written into her contract; well, this is the result - a confused and toothless adaptation of a wonderfully raunchy (and *funny*) book. Andrew Bergman doesn't show anything in his IMDb log for seven years after he penned this turkey...and it serves him right. The Lesson: Don't let the inmates take over the asylum. My vote: 3/10 for Ving and Rena alone.

    I was cruising through my movie channels and I saw that Striptease was playing, I remember seeing the trailer for this movie back in 1994 when I was a kid and wanted to see it, oh, my parents had to forbid it. But of course since I'm 23 and on my own, I think I was allowed to view it. I kinda wish now that I had my parents here to tell me no because this movie was really bad. I mean most people make fun of Showgirls, I mean yeah, it's understandable, but at least that had personality and more memorable moments than this. Demi Moore just strips down to some really depressing music and this movie has the strangest humor in the world. I could see how some people might get a kick out of it, but over all it just a bad movie, it has no zest and nothing to make it special. A story about a stripper... OK, here it goes. The film revolves around Erin Grant, a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favor. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from her negligent husband. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much information. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. Demi is alright in the movie, if even that, I'm being pretty generous considering she let her daughter, Rumor, act as her daughter in this movie. If I were Rumor, I'd be like "next time, I pick the mother/daughter bonding event". I wouldn't really feel like watching my mother dance around naked for men nore a camera. Well Rumor must have gotten a huge raise in her allowance for that to happen. But anyways, I wouldn't recommend Striptease, it was a sleazy movie, I would even go as far to say that if you want sleaze, go for Showgirls, it's more fun to watch and make fun of, this was just a sad movie. 1/10
