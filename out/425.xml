    Half political satire and half mockumentary, "Bob Roberts" accurately reflects what is wrong with the American political system Â… and indirectly what is right. The film relates the ascension of a charismatic yuppie from Philadelphia, a 35-year old self-made, a gifted swordsman, guitar player and folk singer named Bob Roberts. Like the most memorable movie characters, Bob Roberts is a man of fascinating contradictions: his conservative views are swept off by his youth, handsomeness and communicative smile while his notorious aversion toward the 60's rebelliousness is expressed through folk songs performed in public &agrave; la Bob Dylan. It's not coincidental that the film is Tim Robbins' directorial debut, and that he wrote and starred in it, for it immediately echoes another political classic : "Citizen Kane". When you watch Bob Roberts, you don't have Charles Foster Kane in mind, but as he slowly sinks into the darkest side of his personality, the film gets more distant to its initial satirical tone, and become closer to a powerful character study, scary because true. The strength of "Bob Roberts" is its multi-layered directing, flirting so many tones and styles. The documentary format allows jumping from one scene to another, without caring for its disjointed aspect. We follow Roberts visiting a school, singing in public, being acclaimed by fans or criticized by a journalist, played by Lynne Thigpen. She provides the first interesting insight by calling Roberts a "Machiavellian poseur" even though at that moment, Roberts still strikes as a normal politician. Aren't they all Machiavellian poseurs anyway? But one character regularly pops us as the troublemaker: Giancarlo Espositio plays Bugs Alijah Raplin, a black journalist and activist who discovered the implications of Roberts' anti-drugs foundation with some third-world countries' traffic. Robert's right hand, Lukas Hart III, played by Alan Rickman, has been accused several times but no proof was found whatsoever. According to Raplin, one of the reasons the media doesn't treat the information is because they belong to politicians. Later, an incident during a live TV program proves him right. Bugs' insistence and undesirability inspires a cruel machination against him that will also help Roberts to leverage the number of voters. Bugs, as the attacker who'd turn to be a victim, is an interesting counterpart to the titular character's flamboyance, being everything he's not, he's not an upper class WASP, he doesn't have the same sex-appeal or charisma, he's marginalized by his quest of the truth. The contrast is too obvious though, and I guess the subtle portrayal of Senator Baiste by Gore Vidal, as Roberts' opponent. Vidal embodies the honesty of a politician born with true idealism, a man who has certainly been impacted by James Stewart in "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" and believed that John F. Kennedy would change America, before the disillusioning aftermath of his assassination. Like Bugs, Baiste is victim of a cruel machination accusing him of abusing an underage girl. He never truly recovers from the accusation in the polls, and as he doesn't believe in "negative campaigning", never strikes back. Baiste's interventions bring the most interesting insights about American politics, and I read in IMDb trivia that most of his statements were improvised, which provides a supplementary level of spontaneity and truth. Baiste is actually not surprised by Roberts' appeal. He knows the guy has connections with the CIA, which had proved to work for Nixon. The film is set at the verge of the first Gulf War, and since the beginning, despite the seemingly diplomatic efforts going on, we know the dice are cast. As the storyline progressed, I felt the film lost its realism, got too sensational, even too radical in its attempt to denounce some extreme wings of American policy. Roberts' fans got more and more demonic, forming a sort of collective trance where Roberts was less a political leader than a modern-day guru. They hear what they want to hear, they don't complain, all they want is to have the right to get their share of the American Dream, and from the mouth of a businessman, the share is not symbolical. Roberts doesn't speak about values, but about greed and success, incarnating a cynical detachment that even the crisis of 1987 hadn't defeated. But while I felt the film went too far after the assassination attempt on Roberts, I realized on a second thought that the film couldn't have been more accurate. Are the manipulations orchestrated by Robert's team unconceivable? Just think of Richard Nixon, think of the way George W. Bush attacked Iraq on the basis of false accusation. Yes, politics is made of lying, as Vidal said, it's all about justifying a threat by taking a local thug and waving its menace as a Hitler-like figure. The same manipulation of the Baiste scandal echoes the way, the Bush camp tried avoided the debate about his enlisting in the Vietnam war. History repeats itself. It's true that the portrayal of radicals flirt with caricature while the realism of movies like "JFK" and "Nixon" didn't make them less flattering about politicians. "Bob Roberts" is refreshing because it points the finger on the danger of radical beliefs, and the way they lead to disasters, in the name of so-called values. And since I mentioned "Nixon" and "JFK", I realize that the 90's might be the best decade for political movies, Oliver Stone took the dramatic approach while "Bob Roberts" and "Wag the Dog", another gem of Black comedy, were more satirical but, at the end, more prophetic. Maybe it's due to the fact that the 90's were still close enough to the 70's, so the Nixon's trauma wasn't healed yet, and close enough to the 2000's, so people could foreshadow the fanatical path America was taking. The pedagogic aspect of "Bob Roberts" is undeniable, but it's its prophetic value that makes the whole experience chilling, behind the genuine laughs it generates.

    Bob Roberts is political satire at its best, written and directed by Tim Robbins who is hilarious a conservative senatorial candidate running for office in Pennsylvania against a liberal counterpart, Brickley Paiste(Gore Vidal), a casting stroke of genius. Robbins is, of course, well known for his outspoken left wing views. A vicious and personal attack by Roberts on Paiste continue throughout the campaign leading up to the election. Fiction is copying truth in this instance as anyone following the news will understand while watching Robbins actions. Both Vidal and Robbins are caustic and funny but they do manage to deliver a message about what bs all politics is in the end. Depending on which side of the road you live, will probably determine your enjoyment of Bob Roberts; personally I loved it.

    This film is about a singer's campaign to run for the Senate, against tough competition from the current Senator. Lots go on in the campaign for the Senate, so the plot is naturally fast paced and confusing. One minute, you see supporters of Bob Roberts praising him, another minute there are haters who say Bob Roberts have done illegal dealings. Maybe it is the filmmakers' wish to make it ambiguous as to which side is right, but there is one shot towards the end that makes the whole argument pretty clear. The songs are nice, but I think it is far too prominent in the the film. We are forced to watch the whole fake music video, or watch the whole live performance of a song many times in the film. The flow would have been better if we were just shown snippets of songs.

    "Self determination. The choice to be... what you want to be. And I wanted to be... rich!" This is the story of a superstar singer turned politician. The movie has good directing, a good script, excellent acting, countless cameos and funny, witty and entertaining music. Tim Robbins is the mastermind behind this movie. He is directing, acting, writing, singing, song writing - in one word, he does everything. And he does everything well. His directing is brilliant and the subject allows him to try his hand at directing movies, video clips, concerts and political rallies, all in one. And the result is incredible. There is a lot of mobility to the movie, and he uses the shaky cam a lot, but without the shaky part, which is remarkable. Also there is a clear distinction between mobile and static scenes, and the two don't mix, they don't bleed into each other, and there is no attempt to film one mobile scene with a fixed camera or the other way around. The script starts lighthearted, funny and highly entertaining and it turns darker and darker as time goes by. The narration and the narrator are brilliant, the mix of singing and politics is very well done, managing a fine balance. There are heavier touches later in the movie, as the writer drives his point home, but they are to be expected. There is also subtlety and innuendo. The actors are very good. Tim Robbins is a natural, both as an actor and as a singer, and his portrayal of a tireless, relentless, flawless political machine is brilliant. Gore Vidal is excellent, and Alan Rickman and Ray Wise are perfect for their roles. There are a lot of cameos by A-list and B-list Hollywood actors, and the movie turns at times into a veritable "Spot the celebrity" kind of game, which ads to the entertaining value. "James Spader, hello Sir, right this way. Here are your lines, this way please. Susan Sarandon, Hellen Hunt, Pamela Reed, Fred Ward, Jon Cusack, welcome, welcome. Here are your parts, please go right this way. Jack Black, Jack Black... I'm sorry Sir, I don't know anybody by that name, but please, please do come in. We'll see what we can do." The music is the glue that brings this movie together. It is militant, the lyrics are catchy and brutally honest, even if they are meant as a satire, not to be played out of context. The music video clips are hilarious and the concerts are very engaging and even moving, at times. The end credits feature a Bob Dylan like moment, the inspiration for the music and for the movie as a whole, bringing the powerful performance to a full circle. Bob Roberts. Brilliant movie, witty, entertaining and downright scary, at times. 10/10.

    Recently, I had a chance to re-visit this film after not seeing it for a while, and to me this film has acquired some new meaning since it was released back in the early 90's. Our country has seen quite a bit of political upheaval since the release of this film, and when you read the current headlines dealing with the new, extreme version of the Republican/Tea Party, you can't help but think that this film was far head of it's time in predicting the new wave of conservatives that we are currently seeing in this country. You could almost imagine Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, as well as Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachmann, John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and all of the other extreme right/Teaparty personalities being in this film. When you look at Jack Black's character staring blankly into the camera while he and his brothers profess their love for Bob Roberts, you can almost transpose them into the faces of the current Teaparty Republicans. And the speech that Giancarlo Esposito's character Bugs Raplin gives towards the end of the film about how corporate media doesn't want to tell you the truth almost accurately predicts what we are seeing now with many media outlets being owned by corporations such as GE, Comcast, Time Warner and others who dilute the information we see every day on TV. For me, this film was perhaps more visionary than originally intended, and in future years might be looked at not as political satire, but as a very keen predictor of what has happened to our political process and the watering down of the corporate news media.

    After reading several reviews and seeing the 7 rating for this movie, I anxiously ordered this movie and awaited its arrival. Sadly the movie that greeted me was almost unwatchable. Poor writing, horrible directing and passable acting congealed to for a murky substance that is unpalatable to any intelligent movie goer. Usually there are some redeeming qualities or a few jokes or plot lines that hit even in a poor production but I can't find anything positive about this movie except that it does eventually end. Avoid at all costs!!! Not worth the time!!!

    It was by chance that I saw this; it was on television, and when I looked it up, I immediately wanted to watch it. This is a mockumentary(staged documentary) about a fictitious campaign, and its satire is biting with a lasting sting. What makes this work so well is that it transcends the politics; this isn't really about Right or Left wing. Roberts uses pure demagogy, peddling easy solutions, and never making it entirely clear what he intends to *do*. Thus, his potential voters themselves fill in the vacuum with how they, personally, think the country should be run. This film excellently points out this danger of democracy, promoting eternal vigilance. It doesn't matter what actual stance Robbins(for the record, I'm not a fan of his) has outside of this movie, it is not relevant. If I had to say anything negative about this, it would probably be that it is arguably quite black and white, but maybe this was intentional, and what it is speaking ill of is not something that should be defended. The writing is sharp, and the script and dialog are marvelous. I enjoyed the numerous references to Bob Dylan immensely. The acting is great(and there are many big names in small roles in this). This was Jack Black's debut, and I'm surprised to say that he's really good in it. The editing and cinematography are well-done. There is a bit of strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone informed enough to appreciate it. Terrifying and memorable. 8/10

    We gave this film an excruciating 42 minutes. Even though we're liberal Democrats, Tim Robbins just wasn't convincing as a conservative. Richard Dreyfuss, also a liberal in real life, was able to play a delightfully sleazy conservative politician in "Dave", but Robbins obviously found it hard to play a character so different from his own personal values. It was clear that he himself didn't like the character he was playing - he seemed to be holding so much back. Even worse, the pace was so slow that after 42 minutes we didn't seem to know any more about the plot than we did after the first five! Maybe the film gets more interesting, but those 42 minutes felt like 42 hours. Rent "Dave" instead.

    It's interesting that Tim Robbins picked Pennsylvania of all places for his satirical film Bob Roberts. Written, directed, and starring Tim Robbins, it's the story of a rightwing folksinger entertainer who rises to be United States Senator from that state with a big hint of further ambition. For in 1994 one Rick Santorum was elected in that Republican year in that state against a comfortable liberal named Harris Wofford in much the same manner as Robbins's Bob Roberts defeats Senator Brickley Paiste. Santorum was Bob Roberts without the singing. Once again life does imitate art. For satire to be successful it must be both humorous and have the touch of chiffon. This is the reason that Dr. Strangelove as a film succeeds so brilliantly and why Bob Roberts fails. Robbins's film has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. He did satirize one thing in Bob Roberts quite brilliantly, but without even knowing it I'm sure. Gore Vidal's character of Senator Brickley Paiste is nothing short of brilliant for the wrong reasons. He plays the part of a comfortable old, fashionably liberal Senator who has lost contact with the grassroots brilliantly. And I do so love that Dickensian name. Once upon a time the Democratic was confident and assured in its way of being the majority party with its alliance with big labor and big city political machines to turn out the vote. It's dirty little secret was that it relied on generations old resentments from the children and grandchildren of immigrant arrivals who were treated really bad by the Republican party and its WASP base. Where I grew up in Brooklyn, people were taught to vote the Column on the voting machine with the star which is the Democratic symbol in New York State. Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there. A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that. Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum. All this and more combined to make the Democratic majority ripe for the taking in 1994 in which the Santorum-Wofford race was a small part. But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

    "Times are changing back, times are changing back, times are changing back today...", sings ultra-right-wing politician/folksinger Bob Roberts. Grandmommies & -daddies who know just-who-the-heck Bob Dylan was might remember his song "The times, they are a-changing" Â— yeah, that was waaaaay back when Grandmommy & Granddaddy wore flowers, made free love and smoked marijuana to make their hair grow faster. And peace, No-to-Vietnam, civil rights and all that hot sh*t, in the year I was born (but not in the USA). Somebody else pointed out the Dylan documentary "Don't Look Back", from which several scenes were derived Â— including the one where Bob Roberts and his blonde co-singer practice their hymn "We're marching for self-interest" while Bob checks his stocks on his laptop. In 1967, Joan Baez sang "Pretty Polly". Polly, pretty Polly, come and go along with me / Before we get married some pleasure to seek He led her over mountains and valleys so deep / Polly misjudged him and she began to weep Sayin' Willie, Oh Willie, I'm afraid of your ways / The way you've been ramblin' you'd lead me astray He said, Polly, pretty Polly, your guess is about right / I dug on your grave the best part of last night I don't know much about US politics, although I sometimes wonder why they apparently have only two political parties since at least 200 years. But "Bob Roberts" is not an American movie, although it portrays the rise of a pure-bred American Hitler. Those two parties exist virtually everywhere, at least in every Western "democracy", and although they take turns every few years and have other names, the underlying power structure is the same, as their politics are increasingly the same. This is a movie for the grassroots, a socio-political comment and a satire. It's supposed to stimulate the little gray cells, look at our leaders and our TV screens and ask, are we getting what we signed up for? What is the truth, and do I want to know?

There is a lot of mobility to the movie, and he uses the shaky cam a lot, but without the shaky part, which is remarkable. Also there is a clear distinction between mobile and static scenes, and the two don't mix, they don't bleed into each other, and there is no attempt to film one mobile scene with a fixed camera or the other way around. The script starts lighthearted, funny and highly entertaining and it turns darker and darker as time goes by. The narration and the narrator are brilliant, the mix of singing and politics is very well done, managing a fine balance. There are heavier touches later in the movie, as the writer drives his point home, but they are to be expected. There is also subtlety and innuendo. The actors are very good. Tim Robbins is a natural, both as an actor and as a singer, and his portrayal of a tireless, relentless, flawless political machine is brilliant. Gore Vidal is excellent, and Alan Rickman and Ray Wise are perfect for their roles. There are a lot of cameos by A-list and B-list Hollywood actors, and the movie turns at times into a veritable "Spot the celebrity" kind of game, which ads to the entertaining value. "James Spader, hello Sir, right this way. Here are your lines, this way please. Susan Sarandon, Hellen Hunt, Pamela Reed, Fred Ward, Jon Cusack, welcome, welcome. Here are your parts, please go right this way. Jack Black, Jack Black... I'm sorry Sir, I don't know anybody by that name, but please, please do come in. We'll see what we can do." The music is the glue that brings this movie together. It is militant, the lyrics are catchy and brutally honest, even if they are meant as a satire, not to be played out of context. The music video clips are hilarious and the concerts are very engaging and even moving, at times. The end credits feature a Bob Dylan like moment, the inspiration for the music and for the movie as a whole, bringing the powerful performance to a full circle. Bob Roberts. Brilliant movie, witty, entertaining and downright scary, at times. 10/10.

    Recently, I had a chance to re-visit this film after not seeing it for a while, and to me this film has acquired some new meaning since it was released back in the early 90's. Our country has seen quite a bit of political upheaval since the release of this film, and when you read the current headlines dealing with the new, extreme version of the Republican/Tea Party, you can't help but think that this film was far head of it's time in predicting the new wave of conservatives that we are currently seeing in this country. You could almost imagine Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, as well as Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachmann, John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and all of the other extreme right/Teaparty personalities being in this film. When you look at Jack Black's character staring blankly into the camera while he and his brothers profess their love for Bob Roberts, you can almost transpose them into the faces of the current Teaparty Republicans. And the speech that Giancarlo Esposito's character Bugs Raplin gives towards the end of the film about how corporate media doesn't want to tell you the truth almost accurately predicts what we are seeing now with many media outlets being owned by corporations such as GE, Comcast, Time Warner and others who dilute the information we see every day on TV. For me, this film was perhaps more visionary than originally intended, and in future years might be looked at not as political satire, but as a very keen predictor of what has happened to our political process and the watering down of the corporate news media.

    After reading several reviews and seeing the 7 rating for this movie, I anxiously ordered this movie and awaited its arrival. Sadly the movie that greeted me was almost unwatchable. Poor writing, horrible directing and passable acting congealed to for a murky substance that is unpalatable to any intelligent movie goer. Usually there are some redeeming qualities or a few jokes or plot lines that hit even in a poor production but I can't find anything positive about this movie except that it does eventually end. Avoid at all costs!!! Not worth the time!!!

    It was by chance that I saw this; it was on television, and when I looked it up, I immediately wanted to watch it. This is a mockumentary(staged documentary) about a fictitious campaign, and its satire is biting with a lasting sting. What makes this work so well is that it transcends the politics; this isn't really about Right or Left wing. Roberts uses pure demagogy, peddling easy solutions, and never making it entirely clear what he intends to *do*. Thus, his potential voters themselves fill in the vacuum with how they, personally, think the country should be run. This film excellently points out this danger of democracy, promoting eternal vigilance. It doesn't matter what actual stance Robbins(for the record, I'm not a fan of his) has outside of this movie, it is not relevant. If I had to say anything negative about this, it would probably be that it is arguably quite black and white, but maybe this was intentional, and what it is speaking ill of is not something that should be defended. The writing is sharp, and the script and dialog are marvelous. I enjoyed the numerous references to Bob Dylan immensely. The acting is great(and there are many big names in small roles in this). This was Jack Black's debut, and I'm surprised to say that he's really good in it. The editing and cinematography are well-done. There is a bit of strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone informed enough to appreciate it. Terrifying and memorable. 8/10

    We gave this film an excruciating 42 minutes. Even though we're liberal Democrats, Tim Robbins just wasn't convincing as a conservative. Richard Dreyfuss, also a liberal in real life, was able to play a delightfully sleazy conservative politician in "Dave", but Robbins obviously found it hard to play a character so different from his own personal values. It was clear that he himself didn't like the character he was playing - he seemed to be holding so much back. Even worse, the pace was so slow that after 42 minutes we didn't seem to know any more about the plot than we did after the first five! Maybe the film gets more interesting, but those 42 minutes felt like 42 hours. Rent "Dave" instead.

    It's interesting that Tim Robbins picked Pennsylvania of all places for his satirical film Bob Roberts. Written, directed, and starring Tim Robbins, it's the story of a rightwing folksinger entertainer who rises to be United States Senator from that state with a big hint of further ambition. For in 1994 one Rick Santorum was elected in that Republican year in that state against a comfortable liberal named Harris Wofford in much the same manner as Robbins's Bob Roberts defeats Senator Brickley Paiste. Santorum was Bob Roberts without the singing. Once again life does imitate art. For satire to be successful it must be both humorous and have the touch of chiffon. This is the reason that Dr. Strangelove as a film succeeds so brilliantly and why Bob Roberts fails. Robbins's film has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. He did satirize one thing in Bob Roberts quite brilliantly, but without even knowing it I'm sure. Gore Vidal's character of Senator Brickley Paiste is nothing short of brilliant for the wrong reasons. He plays the part of a comfortable old, fashionably liberal Senator who has lost contact with the grassroots brilliantly. And I do so love that Dickensian name. Once upon a time the Democratic was confident and assured in its way of being the majority party with its alliance with big labor and big city political machines to turn out the vote. It's dirty little secret was that it relied on generations old resentments from the children and grandchildren of immigrant arrivals who were treated really bad by the Republican party and its WASP base. Where I grew up in Brooklyn, people were taught to vote the Column on the voting machine with the star which is the Democratic symbol in New York State. Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there. A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that. Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum. All this and more combined to make the Democratic majority ripe for the taking in 1994 in which the Santorum-Wofford race was a small part. But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

    "Times are changing back, times are changing back, times are changing back today...", sings ultra-right-wing politician/folksinger Bob Roberts. Grandmommies & -daddies who know just-who-the-heck Bob Dylan was might remember his song "The times, they are a-changing" Â— yeah, that was waaaaay back when Grandmommy & Granddaddy wore flowers, made free love and smoked marijuana to make their hair grow faster. And peace, No-to-Vietnam, civil rights and all that hot sh*t, in the year I was born (but not in the USA). Somebody else pointed out the Dylan documentary "Don't Look Back", from which several scenes were derived Â— including the one where Bob Roberts and his blonde co-singer practice their hymn "We're marching for self-interest" while Bob checks his stocks on his laptop. In 1967, Joan Baez sang "Pretty Polly". Polly, pretty Polly, come and go along with me / Before we get married some pleasure to seek He led her over mountains and valleys so deep / Polly misjudged him and she began to weep Sayin' Willie, Oh Willie, I'm afraid of your ways / The way you've been ramblin' you'd lead me astray He said, Polly, pretty Polly, your guess is about right / I dug on your grave the best part of last night I don't know much about US politics, although I sometimes wonder why they apparently have only two political parties since at least 200 years. But "Bob Roberts" is not an American movie, although it portrays the rise of a pure-bred American Hitler. Those two parties exist virtually everywhere, at least in every Western "democracy", and although they take turns every few years and have other names, the underlying power structure is the same, as their politics are increasingly the same. This is a movie for the grassroots, a socio-political comment and a satire. It's supposed to stimulate the little gray cells, look at our leaders and our TV screens and ask, are we getting what we signed up for? What is the truth, and do I want to know?

    Half political satire and half mockumentary, "Bob Roberts" accurately reflects what is wrong with the American political system Â… and indirectly what is right. The film relates the ascension of a charismatic yuppie from Philadelphia, a 35-year old self-made, a gifted swordsman, guitar player and folk singer named Bob Roberts. Like the most memorable movie characters, Bob Roberts is a man of fascinating contradictions: his conservative views are swept off by his youth, handsomeness and communicative smile while his notorious aversion toward the 60's rebelliousness is expressed through folk songs performed in public &agrave; la Bob Dylan. It's not coincidental that the film is Tim Robbins' directorial debut, and that he wrote and starred in it, for it immediately echoes another political classic : "Citizen Kane". When you watch Bob Roberts, you don't have Charles Foster Kane in mind, but as he slowly sinks into the darkest side of his personality, the film gets more distant to its initial satirical tone, and become closer to a powerful character study, scary because true. The strength of "Bob Roberts" is its multi-layered directing, flirting so many tones and styles. The documentary format allows jumping from one scene to another, without caring for its disjointed aspect. We follow Roberts visiting a school, singing in public, being acclaimed by fans or criticized by a journalist, played by Lynne Thigpen. She provides the first interesting insight by calling Roberts a "Machiavellian poseur" even though at that moment, Roberts still strikes as a normal politician. Aren't they all Machiavellian poseurs anyway? But one character regularly pops us as the troublemaker: Giancarlo Espositio plays Bugs Alijah Raplin, a black journalist and activist who discovered the implications of Roberts' anti-drugs foundation with some third-world countries' traffic. Robert's right hand, Lukas Hart III, played by Alan Rickman, has been accused several times but no proof was found whatsoever. According to Raplin, one of the reasons the media doesn't treat the information is because they belong to politicians. Later, an incident during a live TV program proves him right. Bugs' insistence and undesirability inspires a cruel machination against him that will also help Roberts to leverage the number of voters. Bugs, as the attacker who'd turn to be a victim, is an interesting counterpart to the titular character's flamboyance, being everything he's not, he's not an upper class WASP, he doesn't have the same sex-appeal or charisma, he's marginalized by his quest of the truth. The contrast is too obvious though, and I guess the subtle portrayal of Senator Baiste by Gore Vidal, as Roberts' opponent. Vidal embodies the honesty of a politician born with true idealism, a man who has certainly been impacted by James Stewart in "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" and believed that John F. Kennedy would change America, before the disillusioning aftermath of his assassination. Like Bugs, Baiste is victim of a cruel machination accusing him of abusing an underage girl. He never truly recovers from the accusation in the polls, and as he doesn't believe in "negative campaigning", never strikes back. Baiste's interventions bring the most interesting insights about American politics, and I read in IMDb trivia that most of his statements were improvised, which provides a supplementary level of spontaneity and truth. Baiste is actually not surprised by Roberts' appeal. He knows the guy has connections with the CIA, which had proved to work for Nixon. The film is set at the verge of the first Gulf War, and since the beginning, despite the seemingly diplomatic efforts going on, we know the dice are cast. As the storyline progressed, I felt the film lost its realism, got too sensational, even too radical in its attempt to denounce some extreme wings of American policy. Roberts' fans got more and more demonic, forming a sort of collective trance where Roberts was less a political leader than a modern-day guru. They hear what they want to hear, they don't complain, all they want is to have the right to get their share of the American Dream, and from the mouth of a businessman, the share is not symbolical. Roberts doesn't speak about values, but about greed and success, incarnating a cynical detachment that even the crisis of 1987 hadn't defeated. But while I felt the film went too far after the assassination attempt on Roberts, I realized on a second thought that the film couldn't have been more accurate. Are the manipulations orchestrated by Robert's team unconceivable? Just think of Richard Nixon, think of the way George W. Bush attacked Iraq on the basis of false accusation. Yes, politics is made of lying, as Vidal said, it's all about justifying a threat by taking a local thug and waving its menace as a Hitler-like figure. The same manipulation of the Baiste scandal echoes the way, the Bush camp tried avoided the debate about his enlisting in the Vietnam war. History repeats itself. It's true that the portrayal of radicals flirt with caricature while the realism of movies like "JFK" and "Nixon" didn't make them less flattering about politicians. "Bob Roberts" is refreshing because it points the finger on the danger of radical beliefs, and the way they lead to disasters, in the name of so-called values. And since I mentioned "Nixon" and "JFK", I realize that the 90's might be the best decade for political movies, Oliver Stone took the dramatic approach while "Bob Roberts" and "Wag the Dog", another gem of Black comedy, were more satirical but, at the end, more prophetic. Maybe it's due to the fact that the 90's were still close enough to the 70's, so the Nixon's trauma wasn't healed yet, and close enough to the 2000's, so people could foreshadow the fanatical path America was taking. The pedagogic aspect of "Bob Roberts" is undeniable, but it's its prophetic value that makes the whole experience chilling, behind the genuine laughs it generates.

    Bob Roberts is political satire at its best, written and directed by Tim Robbins who is hilarious a conservative senatorial candidate running for office in Pennsylvania against a liberal counterpart, Brickley Paiste(Gore Vidal), a casting stroke of genius. Robbins is, of course, well known for his outspoken left wing views. A vicious and personal attack by Roberts on Paiste continue throughout the campaign leading up to the election. Fiction is copying truth in this instance as anyone following the news will understand while watching Robbins actions. Both Vidal and Robbins are caustic and funny but they do manage to deliver a message about what bs all politics is in the end. Depending on which side of the road you live, will probably determine your enjoyment of Bob Roberts; personally I loved it.

    This film is about a singer's campaign to run for the Senate, against tough competition from the current Senator. Lots go on in the campaign for the Senate, so the plot is naturally fast paced and confusing. One minute, you see supporters of Bob Roberts praising him, another minute there are haters who say Bob Roberts have done illegal dealings. Maybe it is the filmmakers' wish to make it ambiguous as to which side is right, but there is one shot towards the end that makes the whole argument pretty clear. The songs are nice, but I think it is far too prominent in the the film. We are forced to watch the whole fake music video, or watch the whole live performance of a song many times in the film. The flow would have been better if we were just shown snippets of songs.

    "Self determination. The choice to be... what you want to be. And I wanted to be... rich!" This is the story of a superstar singer turned politician. The movie has good directing, a good script, excellent acting, countless cameos and funny, witty and entertaining music. Tim Robbins is the mastermind behind this movie. He is directing, acting, writing, singing, song writing - in one word, he does everything. And he does everything well. His directing is brilliant and the subject allows him to try his hand at directing movies, video clips, concerts and political rallies, all in one. And the result is incredible.

Tim Robbins is a natural, both as an actor and as a singer, and his portrayal of a tireless, relentless, flawless political machine is brilliant. Gore Vidal is excellent, and Alan Rickman and Ray Wise are perfect for their roles. There are a lot of cameos by A-list and B-list Hollywood actors, and the movie turns at times into a veritable "Spot the celebrity" kind of game, which ads to the entertaining value. "James Spader, hello Sir, right this way. Here are your lines, this way please. Susan Sarandon, Hellen Hunt, Pamela Reed, Fred Ward, Jon Cusack, welcome, welcome.

So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

    "Times are changing back, times are changing back, times are changing back today...", sings ultra-right-wing politician/folksinger Bob Roberts. Grandmommies & -daddies who know just-who-the-heck Bob Dylan was might remember his song "The times, they are a-changing" Â— yeah, that was waaaaay back when Grandmommy & Granddaddy wore flowers, made free love and smoked marijuana to make their hair grow faster. And peace, No-to-Vietnam, civil rights and all that hot sh*t, in the year I was born (but not in the USA). Somebody else pointed out the Dylan documentary "Don't Look Back", from which several scenes were derived Â— including the one where Bob Roberts and his blonde co-singer practice their hymn "We're marching for self-interest" while Bob checks his stocks on his laptop. In 1967, Joan Baez sang "Pretty Polly". Polly, pretty Polly, come and go along with me / Before we get married some pleasure to seek He led her over mountains and valleys so deep / Polly misjudged him and she began to weep Sayin' Willie, Oh Willie, I'm afraid of your ways / The way you've been ramblin' you'd lead me astray He said, Polly, pretty Polly, your guess is about right / I dug on your grave the best part of last night I don't know much about US politics, although I sometimes wonder why they apparently have only two political parties since at least 200 years. But "Bob Roberts" is not an American movie, although it portrays the rise of a pure-bred American Hitler. Those two parties exist virtually everywhere, at least in every Western "democracy", and although they take turns every few years and have other names, the underlying power structure is the same, as their politics are increasingly the same. This is a movie for the grassroots, a socio-political comment and a satire. It's supposed to stimulate the little gray cells, look at our leaders and our TV screens and ask, are we getting what we signed up for? What is the truth, and do I want to know?

    Half political satire and half mockumentary, "Bob Roberts" accurately reflects what is wrong with the American political system Â… and indirectly what is right. The film relates the ascension of a charismatic yuppie from Philadelphia, a 35-year old self-made, a gifted swordsman, guitar player and folk singer named Bob Roberts. Like the most memorable movie characters, Bob Roberts is a man of fascinating contradictions: his conservative views are swept off by his youth, handsomeness and communicative smile while his notorious aversion toward the 60's rebelliousness is expressed through folk songs performed in public &agrave; la Bob Dylan. It's not coincidental that the film is Tim Robbins' directorial debut, and that he wrote and starred in it, for it immediately echoes another political classic : "Citizen Kane". When you watch Bob Roberts, you don't have Charles Foster Kane in mind, but as he slowly sinks into the darkest side of his personality, the film gets more distant to its initial satirical tone, and become closer to a powerful character study, scary because true. The strength of "Bob Roberts" is its multi-layered directing, flirting so many tones and styles. The documentary format allows jumping from one scene to another, without caring for its disjointed aspect. We follow Roberts visiting a school, singing in public, being acclaimed by fans or criticized by a journalist, played by Lynne Thigpen. She provides the first interesting insight by calling Roberts a "Machiavellian poseur" even though at that moment, Roberts still strikes as a normal politician. Aren't they all Machiavellian poseurs anyway? But one character regularly pops us as the troublemaker: Giancarlo Espositio plays Bugs Alijah Raplin, a black journalist and activist who discovered the implications of Roberts' anti-drugs foundation with some third-world countries' traffic. Robert's right hand, Lukas Hart III, played by Alan Rickman, has been accused several times but no proof was found whatsoever. According to Raplin, one of the reasons the media doesn't treat the information is because they belong to politicians. Later, an incident during a live TV program proves him right. Bugs' insistence and undesirability inspires a cruel machination against him that will also help Roberts to leverage the number of voters. Bugs, as the attacker who'd turn to be a victim, is an interesting counterpart to the titular character's flamboyance, being everything he's not, he's not an upper class WASP, he doesn't have the same sex-appeal or charisma, he's marginalized by his quest of the truth. The contrast is too obvious though, and I guess the subtle portrayal of Senator Baiste by Gore Vidal, as Roberts' opponent. Vidal embodies the honesty of a politician born with true idealism, a man who has certainly been impacted by James Stewart in "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" and believed that John F. Kennedy would change America, before the disillusioning aftermath of his assassination. Like Bugs, Baiste is victim of a cruel machination accusing him of abusing an underage girl. He never truly recovers from the accusation in the polls, and as he doesn't believe in "negative campaigning", never strikes back. Baiste's interventions bring the most interesting insights about American politics, and I read in IMDb trivia that most of his statements were improvised, which provides a supplementary level of spontaneity and truth. Baiste is actually not surprised by Roberts' appeal. He knows the guy has connections with the CIA, which had proved to work for Nixon. The film is set at the verge of the first Gulf War, and since the beginning, despite the seemingly diplomatic efforts going on, we know the dice are cast. As the storyline progressed, I felt the film lost its realism, got too sensational, even too radical in its attempt to denounce some extreme wings of American policy. Roberts' fans got more and more demonic, forming a sort of collective trance where Roberts was less a political leader than a modern-day guru. They hear what they want to hear, they don't complain, all they want is to have the right to get their share of the American Dream, and from the mouth of a businessman, the share is not symbolical. Roberts doesn't speak about values, but about greed and success, incarnating a cynical detachment that even the crisis of 1987 hadn't defeated. But while I felt the film went too far after the assassination attempt on Roberts, I realized on a second thought that the film couldn't have been more accurate. Are the manipulations orchestrated by Robert's team unconceivable? Just think of Richard Nixon, think of the way George W. Bush attacked Iraq on the basis of false accusation. Yes, politics is made of lying, as Vidal said, it's all about justifying a threat by taking a local thug and waving its menace as a Hitler-like figure. The same manipulation of the Baiste scandal echoes the way, the Bush camp tried avoided the debate about his enlisting in the Vietnam war. History repeats itself. It's true that the portrayal of radicals flirt with caricature while the realism of movies like "JFK" and "Nixon" didn't make them less flattering about politicians. "Bob Roberts" is refreshing because it points the finger on the danger of radical beliefs, and the way they lead to disasters, in the name of so-called values. And since I mentioned "Nixon" and "JFK", I realize that the 90's might be the best decade for political movies, Oliver Stone took the dramatic approach while "Bob Roberts" and "Wag the Dog", another gem of Black comedy, were more satirical but, at the end, more prophetic. Maybe it's due to the fact that the 90's were still close enough to the 70's, so the Nixon's trauma wasn't healed yet, and close enough to the 2000's, so people could foreshadow the fanatical path America was taking. The pedagogic aspect of "Bob Roberts" is undeniable, but it's its prophetic value that makes the whole experience chilling, behind the genuine laughs it generates.

    Bob Roberts is political satire at its best, written and directed by Tim Robbins who is hilarious a conservative senatorial candidate running for office in Pennsylvania against a liberal counterpart, Brickley Paiste(Gore Vidal), a casting stroke of genius. Robbins is, of course, well known for his outspoken left wing views. A vicious and personal attack by Roberts on Paiste continue throughout the campaign leading up to the election. Fiction is copying truth in this instance as anyone following the news will understand while watching Robbins actions. Both Vidal and Robbins are caustic and funny but they do manage to deliver a message about what bs all politics is in the end. Depending on which side of the road you live, will probably determine your enjoyment of Bob Roberts; personally I loved it.

    This film is about a singer's campaign to run for the Senate, against tough competition from the current Senator. Lots go on in the campaign for the Senate, so the plot is naturally fast paced and confusing. One minute, you see supporters of Bob Roberts praising him, another minute there are haters who say Bob Roberts have done illegal dealings. Maybe it is the filmmakers' wish to make it ambiguous as to which side is right, but there is one shot towards the end that makes the whole argument pretty clear. The songs are nice, but I think it is far too prominent in the the film. We are forced to watch the whole fake music video, or watch the whole live performance of a song many times in the film. The flow would have been better if we were just shown snippets of songs.

    "Self determination. The choice to be... what you want to be. And I wanted to be... rich!" This is the story of a superstar singer turned politician. The movie has good directing, a good script, excellent acting, countless cameos and funny, witty and entertaining music. Tim Robbins is the mastermind behind this movie. He is directing, acting, writing, singing, song writing - in one word, he does everything. And he does everything well. His directing is brilliant and the subject allows him to try his hand at directing movies, video clips, concerts and political rallies, all in one. And the result is incredible. There is a lot of mobility to the movie, and he uses the shaky cam a lot, but without the shaky part, which is remarkable. Also there is a clear distinction between mobile and static scenes, and the two don't mix, they don't bleed into each other, and there is no attempt to film one mobile scene with a fixed camera or the other way around. The script starts lighthearted, funny and highly entertaining and it turns darker and darker as time goes by. The narration and the narrator are brilliant, the mix of singing and politics is very well done, managing a fine balance. There are heavier touches later in the movie, as the writer drives his point home, but they are to be expected. There is also subtlety and innuendo. The actors are very good. Tim Robbins is a natural, both as an actor and as a singer, and his portrayal of a tireless, relentless, flawless political machine is brilliant. Gore Vidal is excellent, and Alan Rickman and Ray Wise are perfect for their roles. There are a lot of cameos by A-list and B-list Hollywood actors, and the movie turns at times into a veritable "Spot the celebrity" kind of game, which ads to the entertaining value. "James Spader, hello Sir, right this way. Here are your lines, this way please. Susan Sarandon, Hellen Hunt, Pamela Reed, Fred Ward, Jon Cusack, welcome, welcome. Here are your parts, please go right this way. Jack Black, Jack Black... I'm sorry Sir, I don't know anybody by that name, but please, please do come in. We'll see what we can do." The music is the glue that brings this movie together. It is militant, the lyrics are catchy and brutally honest, even if they are meant as a satire, not to be played out of context. The music video clips are hilarious and the concerts are very engaging and even moving, at times. The end credits feature a Bob Dylan like moment, the inspiration for the music and for the movie as a whole, bringing the powerful performance to a full circle. Bob Roberts. Brilliant movie, witty, entertaining and downright scary, at times. 10/10.

    Recently, I had a chance to re-visit this film after not seeing it for a while, and to me this film has acquired some new meaning since it was released back in the early 90's. Our country has seen quite a bit of political upheaval since the release of this film, and when you read the current headlines dealing with the new, extreme version of the Republican/Tea Party, you can't help but think that this film was far head of it's time in predicting the new wave of conservatives that we are currently seeing in this country. You could almost imagine Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, as well as Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachmann, John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and all of the other extreme right/Teaparty personalities being in this film. When you look at Jack Black's character staring blankly into the camera while he and his brothers profess their love for Bob Roberts, you can almost transpose them into the faces of the current Teaparty Republicans. And the speech that Giancarlo Esposito's character Bugs Raplin gives towards the end of the film about how corporate media doesn't want to tell you the truth almost accurately predicts what we are seeing now with many media outlets being owned by corporations such as GE, Comcast, Time Warner and others who dilute the information we see every day on TV. For me, this film was perhaps more visionary than originally intended, and in future years might be looked at not as political satire, but as a very keen predictor of what has happened to our political process and the watering down of the corporate news media.

    After reading several reviews and seeing the 7 rating for this movie, I anxiously ordered this movie and awaited its arrival. Sadly the movie that greeted me was almost unwatchable. Poor writing, horrible directing and passable acting congealed to for a murky substance that is unpalatable to any intelligent movie goer. Usually there are some redeeming qualities or a few jokes or plot lines that hit even in a poor production but I can't find anything positive about this movie except that it does eventually end. Avoid at all costs!!! Not worth the time!!!

    It was by chance that I saw this; it was on television, and when I looked it up, I immediately wanted to watch it. This is a mockumentary(staged documentary) about a fictitious campaign, and its satire is biting with a lasting sting. What makes this work so well is that it transcends the politics; this isn't really about Right or Left wing. Roberts uses pure demagogy, peddling easy solutions, and never making it entirely clear what he intends to *do*. Thus, his potential voters themselves fill in the vacuum with how they, personally, think the country should be run. This film excellently points out this danger of democracy, promoting eternal vigilance. It doesn't matter what actual stance Robbins(for the record, I'm not a fan of his) has outside of this movie, it is not relevant. If I had to say anything negative about this, it would probably be that it is arguably quite black and white, but maybe this was intentional, and what it is speaking ill of is not something that should be defended. The writing is sharp, and the script and dialog are marvelous. I enjoyed the numerous references to Bob Dylan immensely. The acting is great(and there are many big names in small roles in this). This was Jack Black's debut, and I'm surprised to say that he's really good in it. The editing and cinematography are well-done. There is a bit of strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone informed enough to appreciate it. Terrifying and memorable. 8/10

    We gave this film an excruciating 42 minutes. Even though we're liberal Democrats, Tim Robbins just wasn't convincing as a conservative. Richard Dreyfuss, also a liberal in real life, was able to play a delightfully sleazy conservative politician in "Dave", but Robbins obviously found it hard to play a character so different from his own personal values. It was clear that he himself didn't like the character he was playing - he seemed to be holding so much back. Even worse, the pace was so slow that after 42 minutes we didn't seem to know any more about the plot than we did after the first five! Maybe the film gets more interesting, but those 42 minutes felt like 42 hours. Rent "Dave" instead.

    It's interesting that Tim Robbins picked Pennsylvania of all places for his satirical film Bob Roberts. Written, directed, and starring Tim Robbins, it's the story of a rightwing folksinger entertainer who rises to be United States Senator from that state with a big hint of further ambition. For in 1994 one Rick Santorum was elected in that Republican year in that state against a comfortable liberal named Harris Wofford in much the same manner as Robbins's Bob Roberts defeats Senator Brickley Paiste. Santorum was Bob Roberts without the singing. Once again life does imitate art. For satire to be successful it must be both humorous and have the touch of chiffon. This is the reason that Dr. Strangelove as a film succeeds so brilliantly and why Bob Roberts fails. Robbins's film has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. He did satirize one thing in Bob Roberts quite brilliantly, but without even knowing it I'm sure. Gore Vidal's character of Senator Brickley Paiste is nothing short of brilliant for the wrong reasons. He plays the part of a comfortable old, fashionably liberal Senator who has lost contact with the grassroots brilliantly. And I do so love that Dickensian name. Once upon a time the Democratic was confident and assured in its way of being the majority party with its alliance with big labor and big city political machines to turn out the vote. It's dirty little secret was that it relied on generations old resentments from the children and grandchildren of immigrant arrivals who were treated really bad by the Republican party and its WASP base. Where I grew up in Brooklyn, people were taught to vote the Column on the voting machine with the star which is the Democratic symbol in New York State. Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there. A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that. Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum. All this and more combined to make the Democratic majority ripe for the taking in 1994 in which the Santorum-Wofford race was a small part. But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

    "Self determination. The choice to be... what you want to be. And I wanted to be... rich!" This is the story of a superstar singer turned politician. The movie has good directing, a good script, excellent acting, countless cameos and funny, witty and entertaining music. Tim Robbins is the mastermind behind this movie. He is directing, acting, writing, singing, song writing - in one word, he does everything. And he does everything well. His directing is brilliant and the subject allows him to try his hand at directing movies, video clips, concerts and political rallies, all in one. And the result is incredible. There is a lot of mobility to the movie, and he uses the shaky cam a lot, but without the shaky part, which is remarkable. Also there is a clear distinction between mobile and static scenes, and the two don't mix, they don't bleed into each other, and there is no attempt to film one mobile scene with a fixed camera or the other way around. The script starts lighthearted, funny and highly entertaining and it turns darker and darker as time goes by. The narration and the narrator are brilliant, the mix of singing and politics is very well done, managing a fine balance. There are heavier touches later in the movie, as the writer drives his point home, but they are to be expected. There is also subtlety and innuendo. The actors are very good. Tim Robbins is a natural, both as an actor and as a singer, and his portrayal of a tireless, relentless, flawless political machine is brilliant. Gore Vidal is excellent, and Alan Rickman and Ray Wise are perfect for their roles. There are a lot of cameos by A-list and B-list Hollywood actors, and the movie turns at times into a veritable "Spot the celebrity" kind of game, which ads to the entertaining value. "James Spader, hello Sir, right this way. Here are your lines, this way please. Susan Sarandon, Hellen Hunt, Pamela Reed, Fred Ward, Jon Cusack, welcome, welcome. Here are your parts, please go right this way. Jack Black, Jack Black... I'm sorry Sir, I don't know anybody by that name, but please, please do come in. We'll see what we can do." The music is the glue that brings this movie together. It is militant, the lyrics are catchy and brutally honest, even if they are meant as a satire, not to be played out of context. The music video clips are hilarious and the concerts are very engaging and even moving, at times. The end credits feature a Bob Dylan like moment, the inspiration for the music and for the movie as a whole, bringing the powerful performance to a full circle. Bob Roberts. Brilliant movie, witty, entertaining and downright scary, at times. 10/10.

    Recently, I had a chance to re-visit this film after not seeing it for a while, and to me this film has acquired some new meaning since it was released back in the early 90's. Our country has seen quite a bit of political upheaval since the release of this film, and when you read the current headlines dealing with the new, extreme version of the Republican/Tea Party, you can't help but think that this film was far head of it's time in predicting the new wave of conservatives that we are currently seeing in this country. You could almost imagine Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, as well as Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachmann, John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and all of the other extreme right/Teaparty personalities being in this film. When you look at Jack Black's character staring blankly into the camera while he and his brothers profess their love for Bob Roberts, you can almost transpose them into the faces of the current Teaparty Republicans. And the speech that Giancarlo Esposito's character Bugs Raplin gives towards the end of the film about how corporate media doesn't want to tell you the truth almost accurately predicts what we are seeing now with many media outlets being owned by corporations such as GE, Comcast, Time Warner and others who dilute the information we see every day on TV. For me, this film was perhaps more visionary than originally intended, and in future years might be looked at not as political satire, but as a very keen predictor of what has happened to our political process and the watering down of the corporate news media.

    After reading several reviews and seeing the 7 rating for this movie, I anxiously ordered this movie and awaited its arrival. Sadly the movie that greeted me was almost unwatchable. Poor writing, horrible directing and passable acting congealed to for a murky substance that is unpalatable to any intelligent movie goer. Usually there are some redeeming qualities or a few jokes or plot lines that hit even in a poor production but I can't find anything positive about this movie except that it does eventually end. Avoid at all costs!!! Not worth the time!!!

    It was by chance that I saw this; it was on television, and when I looked it up, I immediately wanted to watch it. This is a mockumentary(staged documentary) about a fictitious campaign, and its satire is biting with a lasting sting. What makes this work so well is that it transcends the politics; this isn't really about Right or Left wing. Roberts uses pure demagogy, peddling easy solutions, and never making it entirely clear what he intends to *do*. Thus, his potential voters themselves fill in the vacuum with how they, personally, think the country should be run. This film excellently points out this danger of democracy, promoting eternal vigilance. It doesn't matter what actual stance Robbins(for the record, I'm not a fan of his) has outside of this movie, it is not relevant. If I had to say anything negative about this, it would probably be that it is arguably quite black and white, but maybe this was intentional, and what it is speaking ill of is not something that should be defended. The writing is sharp, and the script and dialog are marvelous. I enjoyed the numerous references to Bob Dylan immensely. The acting is great(and there are many big names in small roles in this). This was Jack Black's debut, and I'm surprised to say that he's really good in it. The editing and cinematography are well-done. There is a bit of strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone informed enough to appreciate it. Terrifying and memorable. 8/10

    We gave this film an excruciating 42 minutes. Even though we're liberal Democrats, Tim Robbins just wasn't convincing as a conservative. Richard Dreyfuss, also a liberal in real life, was able to play a delightfully sleazy conservative politician in "Dave", but Robbins obviously found it hard to play a character so different from his own personal values. It was clear that he himself didn't like the character he was playing - he seemed to be holding so much back. Even worse, the pace was so slow that after 42 minutes we didn't seem to know any more about the plot than we did after the first five! Maybe the film gets more interesting, but those 42 minutes felt like 42 hours. Rent "Dave" instead.

    It's interesting that Tim Robbins picked Pennsylvania of all places for his satirical film Bob Roberts. Written, directed, and starring Tim Robbins, it's the story of a rightwing folksinger entertainer who rises to be United States Senator from that state with a big hint of further ambition. For in 1994 one Rick Santorum was elected in that Republican year in that state against a comfortable liberal named Harris Wofford in much the same manner as Robbins's Bob Roberts defeats Senator Brickley Paiste. Santorum was Bob Roberts without the singing. Once again life does imitate art. For satire to be successful it must be both humorous and have the touch of chiffon. This is the reason that Dr. Strangelove as a film succeeds so brilliantly and why Bob Roberts fails. Robbins's film has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. He did satirize one thing in Bob Roberts quite brilliantly, but without even knowing it I'm sure. Gore Vidal's character of Senator Brickley Paiste is nothing short of brilliant for the wrong reasons. He plays the part of a comfortable old, fashionably liberal Senator who has lost contact with the grassroots brilliantly. And I do so love that Dickensian name. Once upon a time the Democratic was confident and assured in its way of being the majority party with its alliance with big labor and big city political machines to turn out the vote. It's dirty little secret was that it relied on generations old resentments from the children and grandchildren of immigrant arrivals who were treated really bad by the Republican party and its WASP base. Where I grew up in Brooklyn, people were taught to vote the Column on the voting machine with the star which is the Democratic symbol in New York State. Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there. A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that. Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum. All this and more combined to make the Democratic majority ripe for the taking in 1994 in which the Santorum-Wofford race was a small part. But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

    "Times are changing back, times are changing back, times are changing back today...", sings ultra-right-wing politician/folksinger Bob Roberts. Grandmommies & -daddies who know just-who-the-heck Bob Dylan was might remember his song "The times, they are a-changing" Â— yeah, that was waaaaay back when Grandmommy & Granddaddy wore flowers, made free love and smoked marijuana to make their hair grow faster. And peace, No-to-Vietnam, civil rights and all that hot sh*t, in the year I was born (but not in the USA). Somebody else pointed out the Dylan documentary "Don't Look Back", from which several scenes were derived Â— including the one where Bob Roberts and his blonde co-singer practice their hymn "We're marching for self-interest" while Bob checks his stocks on his laptop. In 1967, Joan Baez sang "Pretty Polly". Polly, pretty Polly, come and go along with me / Before we get married some pleasure to seek He led her over mountains and valleys so deep / Polly misjudged him and she began to weep Sayin' Willie, Oh Willie, I'm afraid of your ways / The way you've been ramblin' you'd lead me astray He said, Polly, pretty Polly, your guess is about right / I dug on your grave the best part of last night I don't know much about US politics, although I sometimes wonder why they apparently have only two political parties since at least 200 years. But "Bob Roberts" is not an American movie, although it portrays the rise of a pure-bred American Hitler. Those two parties exist virtually everywhere, at least in every Western "democracy", and although they take turns every few years and have other names, the underlying power structure is the same, as their politics are increasingly the same. This is a movie for the grassroots, a socio-political comment and a satire. It's supposed to stimulate the little gray cells, look at our leaders and our TV screens and ask, are we getting what we signed up for? What is the truth, and do I want to know?

    Half political satire and half mockumentary, "Bob Roberts" accurately reflects what is wrong with the American political system Â… and indirectly what is right. The film relates the ascension of a charismatic yuppie from Philadelphia, a 35-year old self-made, a gifted swordsman, guitar player and folk singer named Bob Roberts. Like the most memorable movie characters, Bob Roberts is a man of fascinating contradictions: his conservative views are swept off by his youth, handsomeness and communicative smile while his notorious aversion toward the 60's rebelliousness is expressed through folk songs performed in public &agrave; la Bob Dylan. It's not coincidental that the film is Tim Robbins' directorial debut, and that he wrote and starred in it, for it immediately echoes another political classic : "Citizen Kane". When you watch Bob Roberts, you don't have Charles Foster Kane in mind, but as he slowly sinks into the darkest side of his personality, the film gets more distant to its initial satirical tone, and become closer to a powerful character study, scary because true. The strength of "Bob Roberts" is its multi-layered directing, flirting so many tones and styles. The documentary format allows jumping from one scene to another, without caring for its disjointed aspect. We follow Roberts visiting a school, singing in public, being acclaimed by fans or criticized by a journalist, played by Lynne Thigpen. She provides the first interesting insight by calling Roberts a "Machiavellian poseur" even though at that moment, Roberts still strikes as a normal politician. Aren't they all Machiavellian poseurs anyway? But one character regularly pops us as the troublemaker: Giancarlo Espositio plays Bugs Alijah Raplin, a black journalist and activist who discovered the implications of Roberts' anti-drugs foundation with some third-world countries' traffic. Robert's right hand, Lukas Hart III, played by Alan Rickman, has been accused several times but no proof was found whatsoever. According to Raplin, one of the reasons the media doesn't treat the information is because they belong to politicians. Later, an incident during a live TV program proves him right. Bugs' insistence and undesirability inspires a cruel machination against him that will also help Roberts to leverage the number of voters. Bugs, as the attacker who'd turn to be a victim, is an interesting counterpart to the titular character's flamboyance, being everything he's not, he's not an upper class WASP, he doesn't have the same sex-appeal or charisma, he's marginalized by his quest of the truth. The contrast is too obvious though, and I guess the subtle portrayal of Senator Baiste by Gore Vidal, as Roberts' opponent. Vidal embodies the honesty of a politician born with true idealism, a man who has certainly been impacted by James Stewart in "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" and believed that John F. Kennedy would change America, before the disillusioning aftermath of his assassination. Like Bugs, Baiste is victim of a cruel machination accusing him of abusing an underage girl. He never truly recovers from the accusation in the polls, and as he doesn't believe in "negative campaigning", never strikes back. Baiste's interventions bring the most interesting insights about American politics, and I read in IMDb trivia that most of his statements were improvised, which provides a supplementary level of spontaneity and truth. Baiste is actually not surprised by Roberts' appeal. He knows the guy has connections with the CIA, which had proved to work for Nixon. The film is set at the verge of the first Gulf War, and since the beginning, despite the seemingly diplomatic efforts going on, we know the dice are cast. As the storyline progressed, I felt the film lost its realism, got too sensational, even too radical in its attempt to denounce some extreme wings of American policy. Roberts' fans got more and more demonic, forming a sort of collective trance where Roberts was less a political leader than a modern-day guru. They hear what they want to hear, they don't complain, all they want is to have the right to get their share of the American Dream, and from the mouth of a businessman, the share is not symbolical. Roberts doesn't speak about values, but about greed and success, incarnating a cynical detachment that even the crisis of 1987 hadn't defeated. But while I felt the film went too far after the assassination attempt on Roberts, I realized on a second thought that the film couldn't have been more accurate. Are the manipulations orchestrated by Robert's team unconceivable? Just think of Richard Nixon, think of the way George W. Bush attacked Iraq on the basis of false accusation. Yes, politics is made of lying, as Vidal said, it's all about justifying a threat by taking a local thug and waving its menace as a Hitler-like figure. The same manipulation of the Baiste scandal echoes the way, the Bush camp tried avoided the debate about his enlisting in the Vietnam war. History repeats itself. It's true that the portrayal of radicals flirt with caricature while the realism of movies like "JFK" and "Nixon" didn't make them less flattering about politicians. "Bob Roberts" is refreshing because it points the finger on the danger of radical beliefs, and the way they lead to disasters, in the name of so-called values. And since I mentioned "Nixon" and "JFK", I realize that the 90's might be the best decade for political movies, Oliver Stone took the dramatic approach while "Bob Roberts" and "Wag the Dog", another gem of Black comedy, were more satirical but, at the end, more prophetic. Maybe it's due to the fact that the 90's were still close enough to the 70's, so the Nixon's trauma wasn't healed yet, and close enough to the 2000's, so people could foreshadow the fanatical path America was taking. The pedagogic aspect of "Bob Roberts" is undeniable, but it's its prophetic value that makes the whole experience chilling, behind the genuine laughs it generates.

    Bob Roberts is political satire at its best, written and directed by Tim Robbins who is hilarious a conservative senatorial candidate running for office in Pennsylvania against a liberal counterpart, Brickley Paiste(Gore Vidal), a casting stroke of genius. Robbins is, of course, well known for his outspoken left wing views. A vicious and personal attack by Roberts on Paiste continue throughout the campaign leading up to the election. Fiction is copying truth in this instance as anyone following the news will understand while watching Robbins actions. Both Vidal and Robbins are caustic and funny but they do manage to deliver a message about what bs all politics is in the end. Depending on which side of the road you live, will probably determine your enjoyment of Bob Roberts; personally I loved it.

    This film is about a singer's campaign to run for the Senate, against tough competition from the current Senator. Lots go on in the campaign for the Senate, so the plot is naturally fast paced and confusing. One minute, you see supporters of Bob Roberts praising him, another minute there are haters who say Bob Roberts have done illegal dealings. Maybe it is the filmmakers' wish to make it ambiguous as to which side is right, but there is one shot towards the end that makes the whole argument pretty clear. The songs are nice, but I think it is far too prominent in the the film. We are forced to watch the whole fake music video, or watch the whole live performance of a song many times in the film. The flow would have been better if we were just shown snippets of songs.

Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there. A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that. Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum. All this and more combined to make the Democratic majority ripe for the taking in 1994 in which the Santorum-Wofford race was a small part. But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

    "Times are changing back, times are changing back, times are changing back today...", sings ultra-right-wing politician/folksinger Bob Roberts. Grandmommies & -daddies who know just-who-the-heck Bob Dylan was might remember his song "The times, they are a-changing" Â— yeah, that was waaaaay back when Grandmommy & Granddaddy wore flowers, made free love and smoked marijuana to make their hair grow faster. And peace, No-to-Vietnam, civil rights and all that hot sh*t, in the year I was born (but not in the USA). Somebody else pointed out the Dylan documentary "Don't Look Back", from which several scenes were derived Â— including the one where Bob Roberts and his blonde co-singer practice their hymn "We're marching for self-interest" while Bob checks his stocks on his laptop. In 1967, Joan Baez sang "Pretty Polly". Polly, pretty Polly, come and go along with me / Before we get married some pleasure to seek He led her over mountains and valleys so deep / Polly misjudged him and she began to weep Sayin' Willie, Oh Willie, I'm afraid of your ways / The way you've been ramblin' you'd lead me astray He said, Polly, pretty Polly, your guess is about right / I dug on your grave the best part of last night I don't know much about US politics, although I sometimes wonder why they apparently have only two political parties since at least 200 years. But "Bob Roberts" is not an American movie, although it portrays the rise of a pure-bred American Hitler. Those two parties exist virtually everywhere, at least in every Western "democracy", and although they take turns every few years and have other names, the underlying power structure is the same, as their politics are increasingly the same. This is a movie for the grassroots, a socio-political comment and a satire. It's supposed to stimulate the little gray cells, look at our leaders and our TV screens and ask, are we getting what we signed up for? What is the truth, and do I want to know?

    Half political satire and half mockumentary, "Bob Roberts" accurately reflects what is wrong with the American political system Â… and indirectly what is right. The film relates the ascension of a charismatic yuppie from Philadelphia, a 35-year old self-made, a gifted swordsman, guitar player and folk singer named Bob Roberts. Like the most memorable movie characters, Bob Roberts is a man of fascinating contradictions: his conservative views are swept off by his youth, handsomeness and communicative smile while his notorious aversion toward the 60's rebelliousness is expressed through folk songs performed in public &agrave; la Bob Dylan. It's not coincidental that the film is Tim Robbins' directorial debut, and that he wrote and starred in it, for it immediately echoes another political classic : "Citizen Kane". When you watch Bob Roberts, you don't have Charles Foster Kane in mind, but as he slowly sinks into the darkest side of his personality, the film gets more distant to its initial satirical tone, and become closer to a powerful character study, scary because true. The strength of "Bob Roberts" is its multi-layered directing, flirting so many tones and styles. The documentary format allows jumping from one scene to another, without caring for its disjointed aspect. We follow Roberts visiting a school, singing in public, being acclaimed by fans or criticized by a journalist, played by Lynne Thigpen. She provides the first interesting insight by calling Roberts a "Machiavellian poseur" even though at that moment, Roberts still strikes as a normal politician. Aren't they all Machiavellian poseurs anyway? But one character regularly pops us as the troublemaker: Giancarlo Espositio plays Bugs Alijah Raplin, a black journalist and activist who discovered the implications of Roberts' anti-drugs foundation with some third-world countries' traffic. Robert's right hand, Lukas Hart III, played by Alan Rickman, has been accused several times but no proof was found whatsoever. According to Raplin, one of the reasons the media doesn't treat the information is because they belong to politicians. Later, an incident during a live TV program proves him right. Bugs' insistence and undesirability inspires a cruel machination against him that will also help Roberts to leverage the number of voters. Bugs, as the attacker who'd turn to be a victim, is an interesting counterpart to the titular character's flamboyance, being everything he's not, he's not an upper class WASP, he doesn't have the same sex-appeal or charisma, he's marginalized by his quest of the truth. The contrast is too obvious though, and I guess the subtle portrayal of Senator Baiste by Gore Vidal, as Roberts' opponent. Vidal embodies the honesty of a politician born with true idealism, a man who has certainly been impacted by James Stewart in "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" and believed that John F. Kennedy would change America, before the disillusioning aftermath of his assassination. Like Bugs, Baiste is victim of a cruel machination accusing him of abusing an underage girl. He never truly recovers from the accusation in the polls, and as he doesn't believe in "negative campaigning", never strikes back. Baiste's interventions bring the most interesting insights about American politics, and I read in IMDb trivia that most of his statements were improvised, which provides a supplementary level of spontaneity and truth. Baiste is actually not surprised by Roberts' appeal. He knows the guy has connections with the CIA, which had proved to work for Nixon. The film is set at the verge of the first Gulf War, and since the beginning, despite the seemingly diplomatic efforts going on, we know the dice are cast. As the storyline progressed, I felt the film lost its realism, got too sensational, even too radical in its attempt to denounce some extreme wings of American policy. Roberts' fans got more and more demonic, forming a sort of collective trance where Roberts was less a political leader than a modern-day guru. They hear what they want to hear, they don't complain, all they want is to have the right to get their share of the American Dream, and from the mouth of a businessman, the share is not symbolical. Roberts doesn't speak about values, but about greed and success, incarnating a cynical detachment that even the crisis of 1987 hadn't defeated. But while I felt the film went too far after the assassination attempt on Roberts, I realized on a second thought that the film couldn't have been more accurate. Are the manipulations orchestrated by Robert's team unconceivable? Just think of Richard Nixon, think of the way George W. Bush attacked Iraq on the basis of false accusation. Yes, politics is made of lying, as Vidal said, it's all about justifying a threat by taking a local thug and waving its menace as a Hitler-like figure. The same manipulation of the Baiste scandal echoes the way, the Bush camp tried avoided the debate about his enlisting in the Vietnam war. History repeats itself. It's true that the portrayal of radicals flirt with caricature while the realism of movies like "JFK" and "Nixon" didn't make them less flattering about politicians. "Bob Roberts" is refreshing because it points the finger on the danger of radical beliefs, and the way they lead to disasters, in the name of so-called values. And since I mentioned "Nixon" and "JFK", I realize that the 90's might be the best decade for political movies, Oliver Stone took the dramatic approach while "Bob Roberts" and "Wag the Dog", another gem of Black comedy, were more satirical but, at the end, more prophetic. Maybe it's due to the fact that the 90's were still close enough to the 70's, so the Nixon's trauma wasn't healed yet, and close enough to the 2000's, so people could foreshadow the fanatical path America was taking. The pedagogic aspect of "Bob Roberts" is undeniable, but it's its prophetic value that makes the whole experience chilling, behind the genuine laughs it generates.

    Bob Roberts is political satire at its best, written and directed by Tim Robbins who is hilarious a conservative senatorial candidate running for office in Pennsylvania against a liberal counterpart, Brickley Paiste(Gore Vidal), a casting stroke of genius. Robbins is, of course, well known for his outspoken left wing views. A vicious and personal attack by Roberts on Paiste continue throughout the campaign leading up to the election. Fiction is copying truth in this instance as anyone following the news will understand while watching Robbins actions. Both Vidal and Robbins are caustic and funny but they do manage to deliver a message about what bs all politics is in the end. Depending on which side of the road you live, will probably determine your enjoyment of Bob Roberts; personally I loved it.

    This film is about a singer's campaign to run for the Senate, against tough competition from the current Senator. Lots go on in the campaign for the Senate, so the plot is naturally fast paced and confusing. One minute, you see supporters of Bob Roberts praising him, another minute there are haters who say Bob Roberts have done illegal dealings. Maybe it is the filmmakers' wish to make it ambiguous as to which side is right, but there is one shot towards the end that makes the whole argument pretty clear. The songs are nice, but I think it is far too prominent in the the film. We are forced to watch the whole fake music video, or watch the whole live performance of a song many times in the film. The flow would have been better if we were just shown snippets of songs.

    "Self determination. The choice to be... what you want to be. And I wanted to be... rich!" This is the story of a superstar singer turned politician. The movie has good directing, a good script, excellent acting, countless cameos and funny, witty and entertaining music. Tim Robbins is the mastermind behind this movie. He is directing, acting, writing, singing, song writing - in one word, he does everything. And he does everything well. His directing is brilliant and the subject allows him to try his hand at directing movies, video clips, concerts and political rallies, all in one. And the result is incredible. There is a lot of mobility to the movie, and he uses the shaky cam a lot, but without the shaky part, which is remarkable. Also there is a clear distinction between mobile and static scenes, and the two don't mix, they don't bleed into each other, and there is no attempt to film one mobile scene with a fixed camera or the other way around. The script starts lighthearted, funny and highly entertaining and it turns darker and darker as time goes by. The narration and the narrator are brilliant, the mix of singing and politics is very well done, managing a fine balance. There are heavier touches later in the movie, as the writer drives his point home, but they are to be expected. There is also subtlety and innuendo. The actors are very good. Tim Robbins is a natural, both as an actor and as a singer, and his portrayal of a tireless, relentless, flawless political machine is brilliant. Gore Vidal is excellent, and Alan Rickman and Ray Wise are perfect for their roles. There are a lot of cameos by A-list and B-list Hollywood actors, and the movie turns at times into a veritable "Spot the celebrity" kind of game, which ads to the entertaining value. "James Spader, hello Sir, right this way. Here are your lines, this way please. Susan Sarandon, Hellen Hunt, Pamela Reed, Fred Ward, Jon Cusack, welcome, welcome. Here are your parts, please go right this way. Jack Black, Jack Black... I'm sorry Sir, I don't know anybody by that name, but please, please do come in. We'll see what we can do." The music is the glue that brings this movie together. It is militant, the lyrics are catchy and brutally honest, even if they are meant as a satire, not to be played out of context. The music video clips are hilarious and the concerts are very engaging and even moving, at times. The end credits feature a Bob Dylan like moment, the inspiration for the music and for the movie as a whole, bringing the powerful performance to a full circle. Bob Roberts. Brilliant movie, witty, entertaining and downright scary, at times. 10/10.

    Recently, I had a chance to re-visit this film after not seeing it for a while, and to me this film has acquired some new meaning since it was released back in the early 90's. Our country has seen quite a bit of political upheaval since the release of this film, and when you read the current headlines dealing with the new, extreme version of the Republican/Tea Party, you can't help but think that this film was far head of it's time in predicting the new wave of conservatives that we are currently seeing in this country. You could almost imagine Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, as well as Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachmann, John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and all of the other extreme right/Teaparty personalities being in this film. When you look at Jack Black's character staring blankly into the camera while he and his brothers profess their love for Bob Roberts, you can almost transpose them into the faces of the current Teaparty Republicans. And the speech that Giancarlo Esposito's character Bugs Raplin gives towards the end of the film about how corporate media doesn't want to tell you the truth almost accurately predicts what we are seeing now with many media outlets being owned by corporations such as GE, Comcast, Time Warner and others who dilute the information we see every day on TV. For me, this film was perhaps more visionary than originally intended, and in future years might be looked at not as political satire, but as a very keen predictor of what has happened to our political process and the watering down of the corporate news media.

    After reading several reviews and seeing the 7 rating for this movie, I anxiously ordered this movie and awaited its arrival. Sadly the movie that greeted me was almost unwatchable. Poor writing, horrible directing and passable acting congealed to for a murky substance that is unpalatable to any intelligent movie goer. Usually there are some redeeming qualities or a few jokes or plot lines that hit even in a poor production but I can't find anything positive about this movie except that it does eventually end. Avoid at all costs!!! Not worth the time!!!

    It was by chance that I saw this; it was on television, and when I looked it up, I immediately wanted to watch it. This is a mockumentary(staged documentary) about a fictitious campaign, and its satire is biting with a lasting sting. What makes this work so well is that it transcends the politics; this isn't really about Right or Left wing. Roberts uses pure demagogy, peddling easy solutions, and never making it entirely clear what he intends to *do*. Thus, his potential voters themselves fill in the vacuum with how they, personally, think the country should be run. This film excellently points out this danger of democracy, promoting eternal vigilance. It doesn't matter what actual stance Robbins(for the record, I'm not a fan of his) has outside of this movie, it is not relevant. If I had to say anything negative about this, it would probably be that it is arguably quite black and white, but maybe this was intentional, and what it is speaking ill of is not something that should be defended. The writing is sharp, and the script and dialog are marvelous. I enjoyed the numerous references to Bob Dylan immensely. The acting is great(and there are many big names in small roles in this). This was Jack Black's debut, and I'm surprised to say that he's really good in it. The editing and cinematography are well-done. There is a bit of strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone informed enough to appreciate it. Terrifying and memorable. 8/10

    We gave this film an excruciating 42 minutes. Even though we're liberal Democrats, Tim Robbins just wasn't convincing as a conservative. Richard Dreyfuss, also a liberal in real life, was able to play a delightfully sleazy conservative politician in "Dave", but Robbins obviously found it hard to play a character so different from his own personal values. It was clear that he himself didn't like the character he was playing - he seemed to be holding so much back. Even worse, the pace was so slow that after 42 minutes we didn't seem to know any more about the plot than we did after the first five! Maybe the film gets more interesting, but those 42 minutes felt like 42 hours. Rent "Dave" instead.

    It's interesting that Tim Robbins picked Pennsylvania of all places for his satirical film Bob Roberts. Written, directed, and starring Tim Robbins, it's the story of a rightwing folksinger entertainer who rises to be United States Senator from that state with a big hint of further ambition. For in 1994 one Rick Santorum was elected in that Republican year in that state against a comfortable liberal named Harris Wofford in much the same manner as Robbins's Bob Roberts defeats Senator Brickley Paiste. Santorum was Bob Roberts without the singing. Once again life does imitate art. For satire to be successful it must be both humorous and have the touch of chiffon. This is the reason that Dr. Strangelove as a film succeeds so brilliantly and why Bob Roberts fails. Robbins's film has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. He did satirize one thing in Bob Roberts quite brilliantly, but without even knowing it I'm sure. Gore Vidal's character of Senator Brickley Paiste is nothing short of brilliant for the wrong reasons. He plays the part of a comfortable old, fashionably liberal Senator who has lost contact with the grassroots brilliantly. And I do so love that Dickensian name. Once upon a time the Democratic was confident and assured in its way of being the majority party with its alliance with big labor and big city political machines to turn out the vote. It's dirty little secret was that it relied on generations old resentments from the children and grandchildren of immigrant arrivals who were treated really bad by the Republican party and its WASP base. Where I grew up in Brooklyn, people were taught to vote the Column on the voting machine with the star which is the Democratic symbol in New York State. Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there. A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that. Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum. All this and more combined to make the Democratic majority ripe for the taking in 1994 in which the Santorum-Wofford race was a small part. But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

    This film is about a singer's campaign to run for the Senate, against tough competition from the current Senator. Lots go on in the campaign for the Senate, so the plot is naturally fast paced and confusing. One minute, you see supporters of Bob Roberts praising him, another minute there are haters who say Bob Roberts have done illegal dealings. Maybe it is the filmmakers' wish to make it ambiguous as to which side is right, but there is one shot towards the end that makes the whole argument pretty clear. The songs are nice, but I think it is far too prominent in the the film. We are forced to watch the whole fake music video, or watch the whole live performance of a song many times in the film. The flow would have been better if we were just shown snippets of songs.

    "Self determination. The choice to be... what you want to be. And I wanted to be... rich!" This is the story of a superstar singer turned politician. The movie has good directing, a good script, excellent acting, countless cameos and funny, witty and entertaining music. Tim Robbins is the mastermind behind this movie. He is directing, acting, writing, singing, song writing - in one word, he does everything. And he does everything well. His directing is brilliant and the subject allows him to try his hand at directing movies, video clips, concerts and political rallies, all in one. And the result is incredible. There is a lot of mobility to the movie, and he uses the shaky cam a lot, but without the shaky part, which is remarkable. Also there is a clear distinction between mobile and static scenes, and the two don't mix, they don't bleed into each other, and there is no attempt to film one mobile scene with a fixed camera or the other way around. The script starts lighthearted, funny and highly entertaining and it turns darker and darker as time goes by. The narration and the narrator are brilliant, the mix of singing and politics is very well done, managing a fine balance. There are heavier touches later in the movie, as the writer drives his point home, but they are to be expected. There is also subtlety and innuendo. The actors are very good. Tim Robbins is a natural, both as an actor and as a singer, and his portrayal of a tireless, relentless, flawless political machine is brilliant. Gore Vidal is excellent, and Alan Rickman and Ray Wise are perfect for their roles. There are a lot of cameos by A-list and B-list Hollywood actors, and the movie turns at times into a veritable "Spot the celebrity" kind of game, which ads to the entertaining value. "James Spader, hello Sir, right this way. Here are your lines, this way please. Susan Sarandon, Hellen Hunt, Pamela Reed, Fred Ward, Jon Cusack, welcome, welcome. Here are your parts, please go right this way. Jack Black, Jack Black... I'm sorry Sir, I don't know anybody by that name, but please, please do come in. We'll see what we can do." The music is the glue that brings this movie together. It is militant, the lyrics are catchy and brutally honest, even if they are meant as a satire, not to be played out of context. The music video clips are hilarious and the concerts are very engaging and even moving, at times. The end credits feature a Bob Dylan like moment, the inspiration for the music and for the movie as a whole, bringing the powerful performance to a full circle. Bob Roberts. Brilliant movie, witty, entertaining and downright scary, at times. 10/10.

    Recently, I had a chance to re-visit this film after not seeing it for a while, and to me this film has acquired some new meaning since it was released back in the early 90's. Our country has seen quite a bit of political upheaval since the release of this film, and when you read the current headlines dealing with the new, extreme version of the Republican/Tea Party, you can't help but think that this film was far head of it's time in predicting the new wave of conservatives that we are currently seeing in this country. You could almost imagine Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, as well as Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachmann, John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and all of the other extreme right/Teaparty personalities being in this film. When you look at Jack Black's character staring blankly into the camera while he and his brothers profess their love for Bob Roberts, you can almost transpose them into the faces of the current Teaparty Republicans. And the speech that Giancarlo Esposito's character Bugs Raplin gives towards the end of the film about how corporate media doesn't want to tell you the truth almost accurately predicts what we are seeing now with many media outlets being owned by corporations such as GE, Comcast, Time Warner and others who dilute the information we see every day on TV. For me, this film was perhaps more visionary than originally intended, and in future years might be looked at not as political satire, but as a very keen predictor of what has happened to our political process and the watering down of the corporate news media.

    After reading several reviews and seeing the 7 rating for this movie, I anxiously ordered this movie and awaited its arrival. Sadly the movie that greeted me was almost unwatchable. Poor writing, horrible directing and passable acting congealed to for a murky substance that is unpalatable to any intelligent movie goer. Usually there are some redeeming qualities or a few jokes or plot lines that hit even in a poor production but I can't find anything positive about this movie except that it does eventually end. Avoid at all costs!!! Not worth the time!!!

    It was by chance that I saw this; it was on television, and when I looked it up, I immediately wanted to watch it. This is a mockumentary(staged documentary) about a fictitious campaign, and its satire is biting with a lasting sting. What makes this work so well is that it transcends the politics; this isn't really about Right or Left wing. Roberts uses pure demagogy, peddling easy solutions, and never making it entirely clear what he intends to *do*. Thus, his potential voters themselves fill in the vacuum with how they, personally, think the country should be run. This film excellently points out this danger of democracy, promoting eternal vigilance. It doesn't matter what actual stance Robbins(for the record, I'm not a fan of his) has outside of this movie, it is not relevant. If I had to say anything negative about this, it would probably be that it is arguably quite black and white, but maybe this was intentional, and what it is speaking ill of is not something that should be defended. The writing is sharp, and the script and dialog are marvelous. I enjoyed the numerous references to Bob Dylan immensely. The acting is great(and there are many big names in small roles in this). This was Jack Black's debut, and I'm surprised to say that he's really good in it. The editing and cinematography are well-done. There is a bit of strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone informed enough to appreciate it. Terrifying and memorable. 8/10

    We gave this film an excruciating 42 minutes. Even though we're liberal Democrats, Tim Robbins just wasn't convincing as a conservative. Richard Dreyfuss, also a liberal in real life, was able to play a delightfully sleazy conservative politician in "Dave", but Robbins obviously found it hard to play a character so different from his own personal values. It was clear that he himself didn't like the character he was playing - he seemed to be holding so much back. Even worse, the pace was so slow that after 42 minutes we didn't seem to know any more about the plot than we did after the first five! Maybe the film gets more interesting, but those 42 minutes felt like 42 hours. Rent "Dave" instead.

    It's interesting that Tim Robbins picked Pennsylvania of all places for his satirical film Bob Roberts. Written, directed, and starring Tim Robbins, it's the story of a rightwing folksinger entertainer who rises to be United States Senator from that state with a big hint of further ambition. For in 1994 one Rick Santorum was elected in that Republican year in that state against a comfortable liberal named Harris Wofford in much the same manner as Robbins's Bob Roberts defeats Senator Brickley Paiste. Santorum was Bob Roberts without the singing. Once again life does imitate art. For satire to be successful it must be both humorous and have the touch of chiffon. This is the reason that Dr. Strangelove as a film succeeds so brilliantly and why Bob Roberts fails. Robbins's film has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. He did satirize one thing in Bob Roberts quite brilliantly, but without even knowing it I'm sure. Gore Vidal's character of Senator Brickley Paiste is nothing short of brilliant for the wrong reasons. He plays the part of a comfortable old, fashionably liberal Senator who has lost contact with the grassroots brilliantly. And I do so love that Dickensian name. Once upon a time the Democratic was confident and assured in its way of being the majority party with its alliance with big labor and big city political machines to turn out the vote. It's dirty little secret was that it relied on generations old resentments from the children and grandchildren of immigrant arrivals who were treated really bad by the Republican party and its WASP base. Where I grew up in Brooklyn, people were taught to vote the Column on the voting machine with the star which is the Democratic symbol in New York State. Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there. A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that. Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum. All this and more combined to make the Democratic majority ripe for the taking in 1994 in which the Santorum-Wofford race was a small part. But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

    "Times are changing back, times are changing back, times are changing back today...", sings ultra-right-wing politician/folksinger Bob Roberts. Grandmommies & -daddies who know just-who-the-heck Bob Dylan was might remember his song "The times, they are a-changing" Â— yeah, that was waaaaay back when Grandmommy & Granddaddy wore flowers, made free love and smoked marijuana to make their hair grow faster. And peace, No-to-Vietnam, civil rights and all that hot sh*t, in the year I was born (but not in the USA). Somebody else pointed out the Dylan documentary "Don't Look Back", from which several scenes were derived Â— including the one where Bob Roberts and his blonde co-singer practice their hymn "We're marching for self-interest" while Bob checks his stocks on his laptop. In 1967, Joan Baez sang "Pretty Polly". Polly, pretty Polly, come and go along with me / Before we get married some pleasure to seek He led her over mountains and valleys so deep / Polly misjudged him and she began to weep Sayin' Willie, Oh Willie, I'm afraid of your ways / The way you've been ramblin' you'd lead me astray He said, Polly, pretty Polly, your guess is about right / I dug on your grave the best part of last night I don't know much about US politics, although I sometimes wonder why they apparently have only two political parties since at least 200 years. But "Bob Roberts" is not an American movie, although it portrays the rise of a pure-bred American Hitler. Those two parties exist virtually everywhere, at least in every Western "democracy", and although they take turns every few years and have other names, the underlying power structure is the same, as their politics are increasingly the same. This is a movie for the grassroots, a socio-political comment and a satire. It's supposed to stimulate the little gray cells, look at our leaders and our TV screens and ask, are we getting what we signed up for? What is the truth, and do I want to know?

    Half political satire and half mockumentary, "Bob Roberts" accurately reflects what is wrong with the American political system Â… and indirectly what is right. The film relates the ascension of a charismatic yuppie from Philadelphia, a 35-year old self-made, a gifted swordsman, guitar player and folk singer named Bob Roberts. Like the most memorable movie characters, Bob Roberts is a man of fascinating contradictions: his conservative views are swept off by his youth, handsomeness and communicative smile while his notorious aversion toward the 60's rebelliousness is expressed through folk songs performed in public &agrave; la Bob Dylan. It's not coincidental that the film is Tim Robbins' directorial debut, and that he wrote and starred in it, for it immediately echoes another political classic : "Citizen Kane". When you watch Bob Roberts, you don't have Charles Foster Kane in mind, but as he slowly sinks into the darkest side of his personality, the film gets more distant to its initial satirical tone, and become closer to a powerful character study, scary because true. The strength of "Bob Roberts" is its multi-layered directing, flirting so many tones and styles. The documentary format allows jumping from one scene to another, without caring for its disjointed aspect. We follow Roberts visiting a school, singing in public, being acclaimed by fans or criticized by a journalist, played by Lynne Thigpen. She provides the first interesting insight by calling Roberts a "Machiavellian poseur" even though at that moment, Roberts still strikes as a normal politician. Aren't they all Machiavellian poseurs anyway? But one character regularly pops us as the troublemaker: Giancarlo Espositio plays Bugs Alijah Raplin, a black journalist and activist who discovered the implications of Roberts' anti-drugs foundation with some third-world countries' traffic. Robert's right hand, Lukas Hart III, played by Alan Rickman, has been accused several times but no proof was found whatsoever. According to Raplin, one of the reasons the media doesn't treat the information is because they belong to politicians. Later, an incident during a live TV program proves him right. Bugs' insistence and undesirability inspires a cruel machination against him that will also help Roberts to leverage the number of voters. Bugs, as the attacker who'd turn to be a victim, is an interesting counterpart to the titular character's flamboyance, being everything he's not, he's not an upper class WASP, he doesn't have the same sex-appeal or charisma, he's marginalized by his quest of the truth. The contrast is too obvious though, and I guess the subtle portrayal of Senator Baiste by Gore Vidal, as Roberts' opponent. Vidal embodies the honesty of a politician born with true idealism, a man who has certainly been impacted by James Stewart in "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" and believed that John F. Kennedy would change America, before the disillusioning aftermath of his assassination. Like Bugs, Baiste is victim of a cruel machination accusing him of abusing an underage girl. He never truly recovers from the accusation in the polls, and as he doesn't believe in "negative campaigning", never strikes back. Baiste's interventions bring the most interesting insights about American politics, and I read in IMDb trivia that most of his statements were improvised, which provides a supplementary level of spontaneity and truth. Baiste is actually not surprised by Roberts' appeal. He knows the guy has connections with the CIA, which had proved to work for Nixon. The film is set at the verge of the first Gulf War, and since the beginning, despite the seemingly diplomatic efforts going on, we know the dice are cast. As the storyline progressed, I felt the film lost its realism, got too sensational, even too radical in its attempt to denounce some extreme wings of American policy. Roberts' fans got more and more demonic, forming a sort of collective trance where Roberts was less a political leader than a modern-day guru. They hear what they want to hear, they don't complain, all they want is to have the right to get their share of the American Dream, and from the mouth of a businessman, the share is not symbolical. Roberts doesn't speak about values, but about greed and success, incarnating a cynical detachment that even the crisis of 1987 hadn't defeated. But while I felt the film went too far after the assassination attempt on Roberts, I realized on a second thought that the film couldn't have been more accurate. Are the manipulations orchestrated by Robert's team unconceivable? Just think of Richard Nixon, think of the way George W. Bush attacked Iraq on the basis of false accusation. Yes, politics is made of lying, as Vidal said, it's all about justifying a threat by taking a local thug and waving its menace as a Hitler-like figure. The same manipulation of the Baiste scandal echoes the way, the Bush camp tried avoided the debate about his enlisting in the Vietnam war. History repeats itself. It's true that the portrayal of radicals flirt with caricature while the realism of movies like "JFK" and "Nixon" didn't make them less flattering about politicians. "Bob Roberts" is refreshing because it points the finger on the danger of radical beliefs, and the way they lead to disasters, in the name of so-called values. And since I mentioned "Nixon" and "JFK", I realize that the 90's might be the best decade for political movies, Oliver Stone took the dramatic approach while "Bob Roberts" and "Wag the Dog", another gem of Black comedy, were more satirical but, at the end, more prophetic. Maybe it's due to the fact that the 90's were still close enough to the 70's, so the Nixon's trauma wasn't healed yet, and close enough to the 2000's, so people could foreshadow the fanatical path America was taking. The pedagogic aspect of "Bob Roberts" is undeniable, but it's its prophetic value that makes the whole experience chilling, behind the genuine laughs it generates.

    Bob Roberts is political satire at its best, written and directed by Tim Robbins who is hilarious a conservative senatorial candidate running for office in Pennsylvania against a liberal counterpart, Brickley Paiste(Gore Vidal), a casting stroke of genius. Robbins is, of course, well known for his outspoken left wing views. A vicious and personal attack by Roberts on Paiste continue throughout the campaign leading up to the election. Fiction is copying truth in this instance as anyone following the news will understand while watching Robbins actions. Both Vidal and Robbins are caustic and funny but they do manage to deliver a message about what bs all politics is in the end. Depending on which side of the road you live, will probably determine your enjoyment of Bob Roberts; personally I loved it.

Gore Vidal's character of Senator Brickley Paiste is nothing short of brilliant for the wrong reasons. He plays the part of a comfortable old, fashionably liberal Senator who has lost contact with the grassroots brilliantly. And I do so love that Dickensian name. Once upon a time the Democratic was confident and assured in its way of being the majority party with its alliance with big labor and big city political machines to turn out the vote. It's dirty little secret was that it relied on generations old resentments from the children and grandchildren of immigrant arrivals who were treated really bad by the Republican party and its WASP base. Where I grew up in Brooklyn, people were taught to vote the Column on the voting machine with the star which is the Democratic symbol in New York State. Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there. A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that. Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum. All this and more combined to make the Democratic majority ripe for the taking in 1994 in which the Santorum-Wofford race was a small part. But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

    "Times are changing back, times are changing back, times are changing back today...", sings ultra-right-wing politician/folksinger Bob Roberts. Grandmommies & -daddies who know just-who-the-heck Bob Dylan was might remember his song "The times, they are a-changing" Â— yeah, that was waaaaay back when Grandmommy & Granddaddy wore flowers, made free love and smoked marijuana to make their hair grow faster. And peace, No-to-Vietnam, civil rights and all that hot sh*t, in the year I was born (but not in the USA). Somebody else pointed out the Dylan documentary "Don't Look Back", from which several scenes were derived Â— including the one where Bob Roberts and his blonde co-singer practice their hymn "We're marching for self-interest" while Bob checks his stocks on his laptop. In 1967, Joan Baez sang "Pretty Polly". Polly, pretty Polly, come and go along with me / Before we get married some pleasure to seek He led her over mountains and valleys so deep / Polly misjudged him and she began to weep Sayin' Willie, Oh Willie, I'm afraid of your ways / The way you've been ramblin' you'd lead me astray He said, Polly, pretty Polly, your guess is about right / I dug on your grave the best part of last night I don't know much about US politics, although I sometimes wonder why they apparently have only two political parties since at least 200 years. But "Bob Roberts" is not an American movie, although it portrays the rise of a pure-bred American Hitler. Those two parties exist virtually everywhere, at least in every Western "democracy", and although they take turns every few years and have other names, the underlying power structure is the same, as their politics are increasingly the same. This is a movie for the grassroots, a socio-political comment and a satire. It's supposed to stimulate the little gray cells, look at our leaders and our TV screens and ask, are we getting what we signed up for? What is the truth, and do I want to know?

    Half political satire and half mockumentary, "Bob Roberts" accurately reflects what is wrong with the American political system Â… and indirectly what is right. The film relates the ascension of a charismatic yuppie from Philadelphia, a 35-year old self-made, a gifted swordsman, guitar player and folk singer named Bob Roberts. Like the most memorable movie characters, Bob Roberts is a man of fascinating contradictions: his conservative views are swept off by his youth, handsomeness and communicative smile while his notorious aversion toward the 60's rebelliousness is expressed through folk songs performed in public &agrave; la Bob Dylan. It's not coincidental that the film is Tim Robbins' directorial debut, and that he wrote and starred in it, for it immediately echoes another political classic : "Citizen Kane". When you watch Bob Roberts, you don't have Charles Foster Kane in mind, but as he slowly sinks into the darkest side of his personality, the film gets more distant to its initial satirical tone, and become closer to a powerful character study, scary because true. The strength of "Bob Roberts" is its multi-layered directing, flirting so many tones and styles. The documentary format allows jumping from one scene to another, without caring for its disjointed aspect. We follow Roberts visiting a school, singing in public, being acclaimed by fans or criticized by a journalist, played by Lynne Thigpen. She provides the first interesting insight by calling Roberts a "Machiavellian poseur" even though at that moment, Roberts still strikes as a normal politician. Aren't they all Machiavellian poseurs anyway? But one character regularly pops us as the troublemaker: Giancarlo Espositio plays Bugs Alijah Raplin, a black journalist and activist who discovered the implications of Roberts' anti-drugs foundation with some third-world countries' traffic. Robert's right hand, Lukas Hart III, played by Alan Rickman, has been accused several times but no proof was found whatsoever. According to Raplin, one of the reasons the media doesn't treat the information is because they belong to politicians. Later, an incident during a live TV program proves him right. Bugs' insistence and undesirability inspires a cruel machination against him that will also help Roberts to leverage the number of voters. Bugs, as the attacker who'd turn to be a victim, is an interesting counterpart to the titular character's flamboyance, being everything he's not, he's not an upper class WASP, he doesn't have the same sex-appeal or charisma, he's marginalized by his quest of the truth. The contrast is too obvious though, and I guess the subtle portrayal of Senator Baiste by Gore Vidal, as Roberts' opponent. Vidal embodies the honesty of a politician born with true idealism, a man who has certainly been impacted by James Stewart in "Mr Smith Goes to Washington" and believed that John F. Kennedy would change America, before the disillusioning aftermath of his assassination. Like Bugs, Baiste is victim of a cruel machination accusing him of abusing an underage girl. He never truly recovers from the accusation in the polls, and as he doesn't believe in "negative campaigning", never strikes back. Baiste's interventions bring the most interesting insights about American politics, and I read in IMDb trivia that most of his statements were improvised, which provides a supplementary level of spontaneity and truth. Baiste is actually not surprised by Roberts' appeal. He knows the guy has connections with the CIA, which had proved to work for Nixon. The film is set at the verge of the first Gulf War, and since the beginning, despite the seemingly diplomatic efforts going on, we know the dice are cast. As the storyline progressed, I felt the film lost its realism, got too sensational, even too radical in its attempt to denounce some extreme wings of American policy. Roberts' fans got more and more demonic, forming a sort of collective trance where Roberts was less a political leader than a modern-day guru. They hear what they want to hear, they don't complain, all they want is to have the right to get their share of the American Dream, and from the mouth of a businessman, the share is not symbolical. Roberts doesn't speak about values, but about greed and success, incarnating a cynical detachment that even the crisis of 1987 hadn't defeated. But while I felt the film went too far after the assassination attempt on Roberts, I realized on a second thought that the film couldn't have been more accurate. Are the manipulations orchestrated by Robert's team unconceivable? Just think of Richard Nixon, think of the way George W. Bush attacked Iraq on the basis of false accusation. Yes, politics is made of lying, as Vidal said, it's all about justifying a threat by taking a local thug and waving its menace as a Hitler-like figure. The same manipulation of the Baiste scandal echoes the way, the Bush camp tried avoided the debate about his enlisting in the Vietnam war. History repeats itself. It's true that the portrayal of radicals flirt with caricature while the realism of movies like "JFK" and "Nixon" didn't make them less flattering about politicians. "Bob Roberts" is refreshing because it points the finger on the danger of radical beliefs, and the way they lead to disasters, in the name of so-called values. And since I mentioned "Nixon" and "JFK", I realize that the 90's might be the best decade for political movies, Oliver Stone took the dramatic approach while "Bob Roberts" and "Wag the Dog", another gem of Black comedy, were more satirical but, at the end, more prophetic. Maybe it's due to the fact that the 90's were still close enough to the 70's, so the Nixon's trauma wasn't healed yet, and close enough to the 2000's, so people could foreshadow the fanatical path America was taking. The pedagogic aspect of "Bob Roberts" is undeniable, but it's its prophetic value that makes the whole experience chilling, behind the genuine laughs it generates.

    Bob Roberts is political satire at its best, written and directed by Tim Robbins who is hilarious a conservative senatorial candidate running for office in Pennsylvania against a liberal counterpart, Brickley Paiste(Gore Vidal), a casting stroke of genius. Robbins is, of course, well known for his outspoken left wing views. A vicious and personal attack by Roberts on Paiste continue throughout the campaign leading up to the election. Fiction is copying truth in this instance as anyone following the news will understand while watching Robbins actions. Both Vidal and Robbins are caustic and funny but they do manage to deliver a message about what bs all politics is in the end. Depending on which side of the road you live, will probably determine your enjoyment of Bob Roberts; personally I loved it.

    This film is about a singer's campaign to run for the Senate, against tough competition from the current Senator. Lots go on in the campaign for the Senate, so the plot is naturally fast paced and confusing. One minute, you see supporters of Bob Roberts praising him, another minute there are haters who say Bob Roberts have done illegal dealings. Maybe it is the filmmakers' wish to make it ambiguous as to which side is right, but there is one shot towards the end that makes the whole argument pretty clear. The songs are nice, but I think it is far too prominent in the the film. We are forced to watch the whole fake music video, or watch the whole live performance of a song many times in the film. The flow would have been better if we were just shown snippets of songs.

    "Self determination. The choice to be... what you want to be. And I wanted to be... rich!" This is the story of a superstar singer turned politician. The movie has good directing, a good script, excellent acting, countless cameos and funny, witty and entertaining music. Tim Robbins is the mastermind behind this movie. He is directing, acting, writing, singing, song writing - in one word, he does everything. And he does everything well. His directing is brilliant and the subject allows him to try his hand at directing movies, video clips, concerts and political rallies, all in one. And the result is incredible. There is a lot of mobility to the movie, and he uses the shaky cam a lot, but without the shaky part, which is remarkable. Also there is a clear distinction between mobile and static scenes, and the two don't mix, they don't bleed into each other, and there is no attempt to film one mobile scene with a fixed camera or the other way around. The script starts lighthearted, funny and highly entertaining and it turns darker and darker as time goes by. The narration and the narrator are brilliant, the mix of singing and politics is very well done, managing a fine balance. There are heavier touches later in the movie, as the writer drives his point home, but they are to be expected. There is also subtlety and innuendo. The actors are very good. Tim Robbins is a natural, both as an actor and as a singer, and his portrayal of a tireless, relentless, flawless political machine is brilliant. Gore Vidal is excellent, and Alan Rickman and Ray Wise are perfect for their roles. There are a lot of cameos by A-list and B-list Hollywood actors, and the movie turns at times into a veritable "Spot the celebrity" kind of game, which ads to the entertaining value. "James Spader, hello Sir, right this way. Here are your lines, this way please. Susan Sarandon, Hellen Hunt, Pamela Reed, Fred Ward, Jon Cusack, welcome, welcome. Here are your parts, please go right this way. Jack Black, Jack Black... I'm sorry Sir, I don't know anybody by that name, but please, please do come in. We'll see what we can do." The music is the glue that brings this movie together. It is militant, the lyrics are catchy and brutally honest, even if they are meant as a satire, not to be played out of context. The music video clips are hilarious and the concerts are very engaging and even moving, at times. The end credits feature a Bob Dylan like moment, the inspiration for the music and for the movie as a whole, bringing the powerful performance to a full circle. Bob Roberts. Brilliant movie, witty, entertaining and downright scary, at times. 10/10.

    Recently, I had a chance to re-visit this film after not seeing it for a while, and to me this film has acquired some new meaning since it was released back in the early 90's. Our country has seen quite a bit of political upheaval since the release of this film, and when you read the current headlines dealing with the new, extreme version of the Republican/Tea Party, you can't help but think that this film was far head of it's time in predicting the new wave of conservatives that we are currently seeing in this country. You could almost imagine Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, as well as Sarah Palin, Michelle Bachmann, John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and all of the other extreme right/Teaparty personalities being in this film. When you look at Jack Black's character staring blankly into the camera while he and his brothers profess their love for Bob Roberts, you can almost transpose them into the faces of the current Teaparty Republicans. And the speech that Giancarlo Esposito's character Bugs Raplin gives towards the end of the film about how corporate media doesn't want to tell you the truth almost accurately predicts what we are seeing now with many media outlets being owned by corporations such as GE, Comcast, Time Warner and others who dilute the information we see every day on TV. For me, this film was perhaps more visionary than originally intended, and in future years might be looked at not as political satire, but as a very keen predictor of what has happened to our political process and the watering down of the corporate news media.

    After reading several reviews and seeing the 7 rating for this movie, I anxiously ordered this movie and awaited its arrival. Sadly the movie that greeted me was almost unwatchable. Poor writing, horrible directing and passable acting congealed to for a murky substance that is unpalatable to any intelligent movie goer. Usually there are some redeeming qualities or a few jokes or plot lines that hit even in a poor production but I can't find anything positive about this movie except that it does eventually end. Avoid at all costs!!! Not worth the time!!!

    It was by chance that I saw this; it was on television, and when I looked it up, I immediately wanted to watch it. This is a mockumentary(staged documentary) about a fictitious campaign, and its satire is biting with a lasting sting. What makes this work so well is that it transcends the politics; this isn't really about Right or Left wing. Roberts uses pure demagogy, peddling easy solutions, and never making it entirely clear what he intends to *do*. Thus, his potential voters themselves fill in the vacuum with how they, personally, think the country should be run. This film excellently points out this danger of democracy, promoting eternal vigilance. It doesn't matter what actual stance Robbins(for the record, I'm not a fan of his) has outside of this movie, it is not relevant. If I had to say anything negative about this, it would probably be that it is arguably quite black and white, but maybe this was intentional, and what it is speaking ill of is not something that should be defended. The writing is sharp, and the script and dialog are marvelous. I enjoyed the numerous references to Bob Dylan immensely. The acting is great(and there are many big names in small roles in this). This was Jack Black's debut, and I'm surprised to say that he's really good in it. The editing and cinematography are well-done. There is a bit of strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone informed enough to appreciate it. Terrifying and memorable. 8/10

    We gave this film an excruciating 42 minutes. Even though we're liberal Democrats, Tim Robbins just wasn't convincing as a conservative. Richard Dreyfuss, also a liberal in real life, was able to play a delightfully sleazy conservative politician in "Dave", but Robbins obviously found it hard to play a character so different from his own personal values. It was clear that he himself didn't like the character he was playing - he seemed to be holding so much back. Even worse, the pace was so slow that after 42 minutes we didn't seem to know any more about the plot than we did after the first five! Maybe the film gets more interesting, but those 42 minutes felt like 42 hours. Rent "Dave" instead.

    It's interesting that Tim Robbins picked Pennsylvania of all places for his satirical film Bob Roberts. Written, directed, and starring Tim Robbins, it's the story of a rightwing folksinger entertainer who rises to be United States Senator from that state with a big hint of further ambition. For in 1994 one Rick Santorum was elected in that Republican year in that state against a comfortable liberal named Harris Wofford in much the same manner as Robbins's Bob Roberts defeats Senator Brickley Paiste. Santorum was Bob Roberts without the singing. Once again life does imitate art. For satire to be successful it must be both humorous and have the touch of chiffon. This is the reason that Dr. Strangelove as a film succeeds so brilliantly and why Bob Roberts fails. Robbins's film has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. He did satirize one thing in Bob Roberts quite brilliantly, but without even knowing it I'm sure. Gore Vidal's character of Senator Brickley Paiste is nothing short of brilliant for the wrong reasons. He plays the part of a comfortable old, fashionably liberal Senator who has lost contact with the grassroots brilliantly. And I do so love that Dickensian name. Once upon a time the Democratic was confident and assured in its way of being the majority party with its alliance with big labor and big city political machines to turn out the vote. It's dirty little secret was that it relied on generations old resentments from the children and grandchildren of immigrant arrivals who were treated really bad by the Republican party and its WASP base. Where I grew up in Brooklyn, people were taught to vote the Column on the voting machine with the star which is the Democratic symbol in New York State. Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there. A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that. Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum.

But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated. Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.
