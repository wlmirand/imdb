    Two young children are stranded in the Australian outback and are forced to cope on their own. They meet an Aborigine on "walkabout": a ritualistic separation from his tribe. Louis Nowra wrote, "I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting." I could not agree more -- National Geographic cannot make a film more rich and vibrant than this. Roger Ebert asked rhetorically, "Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication." Is he on to something? I do not know... there is definitely a communication element -- its importance is debatable.

    ... to my youth. I saw this film when it first came out, and my hormones were just starting to spiral. Much of what was being presented I did not understand because of my youth, and it made deep deep sense. No, not an oxymoron. A more clich&eacute;'d response would be it resonated with me. Clich&eacute;s and me aside... this is a beautiful tone poem. I just saw it again after years and it was so deeply impressionable then, the sense of awe and fulfillment came rushing back each scene. My partner asked me why did the father start shooting at the children? Why did he commit suicide (sorry, spoiler)? Why this? Why that? I kept saying to sit back and let it waft in like a breeze. It is a tone poem. Which is my review. It is a tone poem. The segue into finding the ramshackle house in nowhere's-ville says it all. The Ab carrying the radio. The Ab with the preppie jacket wrapped around his waist. The girl barefoot. The young boy barefoot and sunburned. I mean, the metaphors were simultaneously slamming one upside the head like a cast iron skillet, and gentle breezes at the same time. I could go on and on. This is simply one of the great films, ever. It strips away yet simultaneously must utilize modern conventions to convey the story. The sexual references at the same time sledge hammered into the lens yet human beings are wired to respond to these slices of life. The only thing wish is for me, and yes it is a selfish aspect of the review, for me... I want to be able to step through the screen, through time, and go back to the moments I first saw this film and experience the feeling of wonderment and awe I felt then... except I felt them again 40 years later. Selfishly, I also would want to be able to step through the screen and stand with the actors as they scenes are happening, again. It stimulated me to want to be transported... into the scenes, into the presence of the actors, into the Australian countryside, into time. Even the credits reminded me of greatness... Phil Ramone produced the music. A Rod Stewart song. The endlessly beautiful didgeridoo. Hardly clich&eacute;s. These are ephemeral things that speak to us. Which is the point of my review. This is a movie that speaks to us regardless of..... anything. Time. Historical knowledge. Anything. It speaks to us. I want to go Walkabout.

    I wouldn't define this like a drama, it was more like some sort of avant-garde ethnological documentary about Australian aboriginals and their customs or some twisted documentary about reptiles supplemented with nudity scenes to make it more interesting. But if I must accept the fact that it is a drama, then let me tell you this: the plot was very poor, boring and unreal, the performance was mediocre and there was lots of flaws and unnecessary scenes mostly of Jenny Agutter swimming naked (although I must admit it was pleasure to watch her) which did not fit to this movie that trying to call itself drama or adventure. If the editors would cut these scenes the duration of the movie would come down probably to 40 minutes and it wouldn't be that interesting any more :). However it doesn't deserve the rating 7,7 and it is a waste of time to watch it. I was expecting much more after reading the reviews full of "laudes".

    THE SPOILER IS THAT THIS IS TERRIBLE! If I could give this any lower of a rating out of 10 I would. It seriously was the worst movie I have ever seen. It started with terrible actors who seriously could not act to save their lives. No emotion was shown and there was no drama expressed which forced the already terrible storyline into sub zero standards. I implore you to NEVER watch this! Who ever boosted this rating up to a 7.7 must have been smoking something really strong because I have no more faith in society if people honestly believe this could possibly have scored anything above 1. Furthermore I have lost all faith in the Australian film industry, as an Australian I am proud of my heritage and have only the highest respect for the original owners of my land. However, this movie does no one nor anything ANY justice! If the producers were anything but the stupidest people in the world they would stop creating any more copies of this film. This movie's only positive aspect is that it can be studied in English class, where I'm sure, and I hope, every students falls asleep in absolute boredom. Kind Regards, a respected movie critic.

    Beautiful. Just beautiful. When I was expecting another particular survival story, Roeg showed me an amazingly peculiar one. Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself. With no means of transport and no civilized humans around, the kids simply head out into the wilderness. They soon encounter an Aborigine boy who's on a "Walkabout": an Aborigine ritual which involves surviving in the wild for months with the aid of hunting skills after the adolescent reaches a certain age. Thence begins a beautiful and pure journey where the three characters try to outlive the harsh environment with the hunting skills the Aborigine boy possesses. Right at this moment, I am spellbound by this film's images and I will admit that I got to witness a new face of cinema today. Instead of showing us a sweet conventional survival story, Director Nicholas Roeg dwells on narrating the story in a different and thought-provoking manner. The film has been given a complex and layered narration that is a bit ambiguous. Through smart editing and significant number of freeze frames the director, during the Walkabout journey, tries to compare the two completely different cultures of men. One scene is particularly my favorite where the film alternates between the Aborigine boy butchering a Kangaroo and a butcher in some civilized city doing the same. These astonishing moments question the very nature of human beings. Whether we are lost in some unknown, remote and harsh region of the world or are behind the brick walls of the concrete jungle, we are all simply trying to survive in this cruel world. Roeg never even gives us a clear idea why the father attempts to kill his children and suicides. Though, that is a clear indication of the fact that the father couldn't survive in the civilized world. He was too weak that is the reason why he gave up his life. This film leaves the complexity of the civilized world (Symbolized by the car burnt down by the father) and follows a journey on the beauty of companionship and purity of life. Yes, Pure is the keyword here. We are transported back to the age when everything was "Pure". The film's wonderful finale is the most powerful testament of this aspect. Sometimes certain situations arose in the film when the children are extremely close at getting discovered and saved by civilized people but aren't. At this point, Roeg's camera briefly focuses on these people and shows us what they are doing. There are certain thought-provoking messages hidden in these scenes which, of course, I will not reveal here and will allow you, my dear readers, to discover it's beauty by yourselves. And then there's the spellbinding cinematography and Roeg's amazing direction. Both capture the wilderness very meticulously and the "pillow shots" (A curious shot where the camera focuses on the surrounding elements, for brief moments, of the environment where the action takes place) makes the film more believable. There are beautiful shots of birds, trees, reptiles, the stark desert, the sunrise/sunset, etc. that fills the film with fresh images of mother nature. Walkabout is a beautiful and complex near-masterpiece film from the land of Australia. Just walk into Walkabout and you won't regret it.

    Had the director just told ONE story & stuck with it, & stop preaching & stop pushing unnecessary themes & images that distract, this could have been WONDERFUL. The awful 1970s soundtrack & overt political themes just get tedious. Making something "artistic" out of what really could have been an emotionally satisfying story ruined it. In fact, ALL EMOTION is lacking in this highly emotional set up. So sad. Terrible movie that could/should be remade by a modern storyteller who knows how to tune into a modern audience would be great. Whatever the political agenda, it was lost amidst the attempts to manipulate.

    I first saw WALKABOUT at an impressionable age and it has stayed with me ever since, not least for its haunting scenes of animal killing and desolation in the Australian outback. WALKABOUT, Nicolas Roeg's masterful exploration of Australia and the people who inhabit it, is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. Roeg brings the harshness of the environment to life in a series of devastating shots that reveal the true heart of the country. His is a world of scorched deserts littered with the corpses of hunted creatures and inhabited by only the brave or foolhardy. In many ways, this is a horror film, bookended by gruesome death and yet containing some moments of pure joy within. The plot is simple: a schoolgirl and her younger brother are lost in the Outback and forced to fend for themselves in a hostile environment. Along the way, they meet up with an Aborigine (played by David Gulpilil, giving a truly great performance of real depth) and the rest of the film chronicles their adventures. Roeg uses this as a basis to explore numerous themes, from the plight of the oppressed indigenous peoples to the contrast between civilisation and the wilderness (to give you a clue, one is utterly condemned and the other fully embraced). Agutter plays a prim and proper, slightly irritating character but Lucien John is excellent as the boy and as previously mentioned, Gulpilil steals every scene he's in. WALKABOUT is one of my favourite films and a real visual experience that transcends cinematic boundaries to become a work of pure art.

    English cinematographer and director Nicolas Roeg's second feature film which was written by English theatre director, poet, theorist, playwright and screenwriter Edward Bond, is loosely based on English author David Gordon Payne alias James Vance Marshall's book from 1959 and premiered In Competition at the 24th Cannes International Film festival in 1971. It was shot entirely on location in Sydney, Australia and is a UK production which was produced by Si Litvinoff. It tells the story about a father who one day goes on a picnic in the Australian wilderness with his two adolescent children. What the children thinks is going be a nice picnic, suddenly turns into a battle for survival when their father pulls out a gun and starts shooting at them. The schoolgirl grabs a hold of her younger brother and manages to hide them behind a rock, but after hearing that her father's car explodes and seeing that he shoots himself, she realizes that they are left to themselves. Intending to get back to Adelaide where they live, the two of them begins to walk into the wilderness and gets lost. The siblings are surrounded by crawling animals, worn-out by the heat and are becoming dehydrated, but suddenly they notice an aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout coming towards them. Acutely and engagingly directed by British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg in the first film he directed on his own, this surreal and ethereal fictional tale draws an exceedingly mysterious portrayal of an abandoned brother and sister's eventful journey of discovery through the Australian wilderness and their encounter with a young aboriginal man. While notable for it's distinct and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Nicolas Roeg, fine editing by British film editor Antony Gibbs and use of sound, this character-driven and finely tuned adventure drama which was executively produced by American producer Max L. Raab (1925-2008) examines themes like coming-of-age, human relations and cultural differences and contains a great score by English composer John Barry (1933-2011). This sparse study of character which is set against the backdrop of the Australian outback and where two siblings are looking for a way to get back to their home, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent and fragmented narrative structure, substantial character development, minimal dialog and the unconventional acting performances by English television and film actress Jenny Agutter, producer and Nicolas Roeg's son Luc Roeg in his debut feature film role and Indigenous Australian actor and traditional dancer David Gulpilil in his debut feature film role. A poignantly atmospheric, memorable and esoteric independent film from the early period of the Australian New Wave in the early 1970s.

    Walkabout is an unusual film; there are few characters and we never learn the names of those. Set in Australia a father drives into the outback with his teenaged daughter and young son; as the boy plays and the girl prepares a picnic the man starts shooting at them. The girl grabs her brother and they take cover; unable to kill his children the man sets fire to his car before shooting himself. This leaves the two children lost deep in the outback with no idea where the nearest town is or even where there is a road. They head off together heading for high ground hoping that they might see a sign of civilisation. They can't see anything so set off again and eventually find an isolated fruit tree next to a small waterhole. They eat and drink before going to sleep; by the time they awaken the water has dried up and the birds have stripped the fruit. It looks as if they will die here until an aboriginal boy finds them. He doesn't speak a word of English and they don't speak his language but he lets them tag along with him and shares the food he finds with them. Ultimately they find a farm but it has long since been abandoned; it is however near a road and that will inevitably lead the two siblings back to civilisation whatever that is. This is one of those films that viewers are likely to declare a masterpiece or terrible; I'm inclined to the former view. There is something strange about it; director Nicolas Roeg has filmed it in a way that makes the landscape both beautiful and ugly at the same time; the camera often cuts away to show wildlife; sometimes alive other times dead and decaying. The landscape they walk through often feels so dry one gets thirsty just looking at it. When they meet the young aborigine his language is left unsubtitled so it is as alien to the viewer as it is to the two siblings. As the three of them travel together the aborigine hunts and kills several animals; we also see a white hunter shooting and cutting open a water buffalo; these scenes might disturb some viewers as they look real. Given the '12' certificate some viewers might be a little surprised to see Jenny Agutter, who was sixteen at the time of filming, totally naked; the scenes are innocent though so shouldn't offend anybody. That isn't to say there is nothing sexual about the film; the way she looked at the Aboriginal boy showed that she was coming to terms with her burgeoning sexuality even if she never acted on those feelings. While not everybody will enjoy this film I think it is one of those that all film fans should watch once; even if you don't enjoy it there are interesting things to be seen.

    I have seen this film dozens of times, more or less since it first appeared on TV in the mid 70s, and each time see more in it - perhaps a reflection that, as I the viewer get older, I understand more of what is being suggested. You start with the nature (an it is glorious), and then the political undercurrent, perhaps the unspoken sexual imagery, the communication failure, the cultural misunderstandings, the wisdom of the white boy (younger and more open to new ideas), and so on. Many other reviewers have commented on the same. One thing that I notice on my latest viewing. Compare the images of the waterhole halfway through, with the images at the end, when The Girl "remembers" them. They are different - very different. The Girl swims alone in the former, but at the end she is with her brother and the aboriginal boy. They communicate and smile with each other - which almost never happens in the main film where The Girl in particular barely attempts to get to know her guide and saviour. And then the quotation. Is the director also saying here that these memories - that maybe all memory - is idealised? That Nostalgia - what we "remember" - is what we want to, even if - in truth - it never happened that way? That The Girl is wanting to return to a past - the Land of Lost Content - that never actually was? As I say, its a beautiful, wonderful film that would be impossible to make today for half a hundred reasons - and a film that can be watched a dozen times, and still appear fresh. Both simple, and complex with layer upon layer. A masterpiece.

Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself.

Terrible movie that could/should be remade by a modern storyteller who knows how to tune into a modern audience would be great. Whatever the political agenda, it was lost amidst the attempts to manipulate.

    I first saw WALKABOUT at an impressionable age and it has stayed with me ever since, not least for its haunting scenes of animal killing and desolation in the Australian outback. WALKABOUT, Nicolas Roeg's masterful exploration of Australia and the people who inhabit it, is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. Roeg brings the harshness of the environment to life in a series of devastating shots that reveal the true heart of the country. His is a world of scorched deserts littered with the corpses of hunted creatures and inhabited by only the brave or foolhardy. In many ways, this is a horror film, bookended by gruesome death and yet containing some moments of pure joy within. The plot is simple: a schoolgirl and her younger brother are lost in the Outback and forced to fend for themselves in a hostile environment. Along the way, they meet up with an Aborigine (played by David Gulpilil, giving a truly great performance of real depth) and the rest of the film chronicles their adventures. Roeg uses this as a basis to explore numerous themes, from the plight of the oppressed indigenous peoples to the contrast between civilisation and the wilderness (to give you a clue, one is utterly condemned and the other fully embraced). Agutter plays a prim and proper, slightly irritating character but Lucien John is excellent as the boy and as previously mentioned, Gulpilil steals every scene he's in. WALKABOUT is one of my favourite films and a real visual experience that transcends cinematic boundaries to become a work of pure art.

    English cinematographer and director Nicolas Roeg's second feature film which was written by English theatre director, poet, theorist, playwright and screenwriter Edward Bond, is loosely based on English author David Gordon Payne alias James Vance Marshall's book from 1959 and premiered In Competition at the 24th Cannes International Film festival in 1971. It was shot entirely on location in Sydney, Australia and is a UK production which was produced by Si Litvinoff. It tells the story about a father who one day goes on a picnic in the Australian wilderness with his two adolescent children. What the children thinks is going be a nice picnic, suddenly turns into a battle for survival when their father pulls out a gun and starts shooting at them. The schoolgirl grabs a hold of her younger brother and manages to hide them behind a rock, but after hearing that her father's car explodes and seeing that he shoots himself, she realizes that they are left to themselves. Intending to get back to Adelaide where they live, the two of them begins to walk into the wilderness and gets lost. The siblings are surrounded by crawling animals, worn-out by the heat and are becoming dehydrated, but suddenly they notice an aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout coming towards them. Acutely and engagingly directed by British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg in the first film he directed on his own, this surreal and ethereal fictional tale draws an exceedingly mysterious portrayal of an abandoned brother and sister's eventful journey of discovery through the Australian wilderness and their encounter with a young aboriginal man. While notable for it's distinct and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Nicolas Roeg, fine editing by British film editor Antony Gibbs and use of sound, this character-driven and finely tuned adventure drama which was executively produced by American producer Max L. Raab (1925-2008) examines themes like coming-of-age, human relations and cultural differences and contains a great score by English composer John Barry (1933-2011). This sparse study of character which is set against the backdrop of the Australian outback and where two siblings are looking for a way to get back to their home, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent and fragmented narrative structure, substantial character development, minimal dialog and the unconventional acting performances by English television and film actress Jenny Agutter, producer and Nicolas Roeg's son Luc Roeg in his debut feature film role and Indigenous Australian actor and traditional dancer David Gulpilil in his debut feature film role. A poignantly atmospheric, memorable and esoteric independent film from the early period of the Australian New Wave in the early 1970s.

    Walkabout is an unusual film; there are few characters and we never learn the names of those. Set in Australia a father drives into the outback with his teenaged daughter and young son; as the boy plays and the girl prepares a picnic the man starts shooting at them. The girl grabs her brother and they take cover; unable to kill his children the man sets fire to his car before shooting himself. This leaves the two children lost deep in the outback with no idea where the nearest town is or even where there is a road. They head off together heading for high ground hoping that they might see a sign of civilisation. They can't see anything so set off again and eventually find an isolated fruit tree next to a small waterhole. They eat and drink before going to sleep; by the time they awaken the water has dried up and the birds have stripped the fruit. It looks as if they will die here until an aboriginal boy finds them. He doesn't speak a word of English and they don't speak his language but he lets them tag along with him and shares the food he finds with them. Ultimately they find a farm but it has long since been abandoned; it is however near a road and that will inevitably lead the two siblings back to civilisation whatever that is. This is one of those films that viewers are likely to declare a masterpiece or terrible; I'm inclined to the former view. There is something strange about it; director Nicolas Roeg has filmed it in a way that makes the landscape both beautiful and ugly at the same time; the camera often cuts away to show wildlife; sometimes alive other times dead and decaying. The landscape they walk through often feels so dry one gets thirsty just looking at it. When they meet the young aborigine his language is left unsubtitled so it is as alien to the viewer as it is to the two siblings. As the three of them travel together the aborigine hunts and kills several animals; we also see a white hunter shooting and cutting open a water buffalo; these scenes might disturb some viewers as they look real. Given the '12' certificate some viewers might be a little surprised to see Jenny Agutter, who was sixteen at the time of filming, totally naked; the scenes are innocent though so shouldn't offend anybody. That isn't to say there is nothing sexual about the film; the way she looked at the Aboriginal boy showed that she was coming to terms with her burgeoning sexuality even if she never acted on those feelings. While not everybody will enjoy this film I think it is one of those that all film fans should watch once; even if you don't enjoy it there are interesting things to be seen.

    I have seen this film dozens of times, more or less since it first appeared on TV in the mid 70s, and each time see more in it - perhaps a reflection that, as I the viewer get older, I understand more of what is being suggested. You start with the nature (an it is glorious), and then the political undercurrent, perhaps the unspoken sexual imagery, the communication failure, the cultural misunderstandings, the wisdom of the white boy (younger and more open to new ideas), and so on. Many other reviewers have commented on the same. One thing that I notice on my latest viewing. Compare the images of the waterhole halfway through, with the images at the end, when The Girl "remembers" them. They are different - very different. The Girl swims alone in the former, but at the end she is with her brother and the aboriginal boy. They communicate and smile with each other - which almost never happens in the main film where The Girl in particular barely attempts to get to know her guide and saviour. And then the quotation. Is the director also saying here that these memories - that maybe all memory - is idealised? That Nostalgia - what we "remember" - is what we want to, even if - in truth - it never happened that way? That The Girl is wanting to return to a past - the Land of Lost Content - that never actually was? As I say, its a beautiful, wonderful film that would be impossible to make today for half a hundred reasons - and a film that can be watched a dozen times, and still appear fresh. Both simple, and complex with layer upon layer. A masterpiece.

    Two young children are stranded in the Australian outback and are forced to cope on their own. They meet an Aborigine on "walkabout": a ritualistic separation from his tribe. Louis Nowra wrote, "I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting." I could not agree more -- National Geographic cannot make a film more rich and vibrant than this. Roger Ebert asked rhetorically, "Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication." Is he on to something? I do not know... there is definitely a communication element -- its importance is debatable.

    ... to my youth. I saw this film when it first came out, and my hormones were just starting to spiral. Much of what was being presented I did not understand because of my youth, and it made deep deep sense. No, not an oxymoron. A more clich&eacute;'d response would be it resonated with me. Clich&eacute;s and me aside... this is a beautiful tone poem. I just saw it again after years and it was so deeply impressionable then, the sense of awe and fulfillment came rushing back each scene. My partner asked me why did the father start shooting at the children? Why did he commit suicide (sorry, spoiler)? Why this? Why that? I kept saying to sit back and let it waft in like a breeze. It is a tone poem. Which is my review. It is a tone poem. The segue into finding the ramshackle house in nowhere's-ville says it all. The Ab carrying the radio. The Ab with the preppie jacket wrapped around his waist. The girl barefoot. The young boy barefoot and sunburned. I mean, the metaphors were simultaneously slamming one upside the head like a cast iron skillet, and gentle breezes at the same time. I could go on and on. This is simply one of the great films, ever. It strips away yet simultaneously must utilize modern conventions to convey the story. The sexual references at the same time sledge hammered into the lens yet human beings are wired to respond to these slices of life. The only thing wish is for me, and yes it is a selfish aspect of the review, for me... I want to be able to step through the screen, through time, and go back to the moments I first saw this film and experience the feeling of wonderment and awe I felt then... except I felt them again 40 years later. Selfishly, I also would want to be able to step through the screen and stand with the actors as they scenes are happening, again. It stimulated me to want to be transported... into the scenes, into the presence of the actors, into the Australian countryside, into time. Even the credits reminded me of greatness... Phil Ramone produced the music. A Rod Stewart song. The endlessly beautiful didgeridoo. Hardly clich&eacute;s. These are ephemeral things that speak to us. Which is the point of my review. This is a movie that speaks to us regardless of..... anything. Time. Historical knowledge. Anything. It speaks to us. I want to go Walkabout.

    I wouldn't define this like a drama, it was more like some sort of avant-garde ethnological documentary about Australian aboriginals and their customs or some twisted documentary about reptiles supplemented with nudity scenes to make it more interesting. But if I must accept the fact that it is a drama, then let me tell you this: the plot was very poor, boring and unreal, the performance was mediocre and there was lots of flaws and unnecessary scenes mostly of Jenny Agutter swimming naked (although I must admit it was pleasure to watch her) which did not fit to this movie that trying to call itself drama or adventure. If the editors would cut these scenes the duration of the movie would come down probably to 40 minutes and it wouldn't be that interesting any more :). However it doesn't deserve the rating 7,7 and it is a waste of time to watch it. I was expecting much more after reading the reviews full of "laudes".

    THE SPOILER IS THAT THIS IS TERRIBLE! If I could give this any lower of a rating out of 10 I would. It seriously was the worst movie I have ever seen. It started with terrible actors who seriously could not act to save their lives. No emotion was shown and there was no drama expressed which forced the already terrible storyline into sub zero standards. I implore you to NEVER watch this! Who ever boosted this rating up to a 7.7 must have been smoking something really strong because I have no more faith in society if people honestly believe this could possibly have scored anything above 1. Furthermore I have lost all faith in the Australian film industry, as an Australian I am proud of my heritage and have only the highest respect for the original owners of my land. However, this movie does no one nor anything ANY justice! If the producers were anything but the stupidest people in the world they would stop creating any more copies of this film. This movie's only positive aspect is that it can be studied in English class, where I'm sure, and I hope, every students falls asleep in absolute boredom. Kind Regards, a respected movie critic.

    Beautiful. Just beautiful. When I was expecting another particular survival story, Roeg showed me an amazingly peculiar one. Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself. With no means of transport and no civilized humans around, the kids simply head out into the wilderness. They soon encounter an Aborigine boy who's on a "Walkabout": an Aborigine ritual which involves surviving in the wild for months with the aid of hunting skills after the adolescent reaches a certain age. Thence begins a beautiful and pure journey where the three characters try to outlive the harsh environment with the hunting skills the Aborigine boy possesses. Right at this moment, I am spellbound by this film's images and I will admit that I got to witness a new face of cinema today. Instead of showing us a sweet conventional survival story, Director Nicholas Roeg dwells on narrating the story in a different and thought-provoking manner. The film has been given a complex and layered narration that is a bit ambiguous. Through smart editing and significant number of freeze frames the director, during the Walkabout journey, tries to compare the two completely different cultures of men. One scene is particularly my favorite where the film alternates between the Aborigine boy butchering a Kangaroo and a butcher in some civilized city doing the same. These astonishing moments question the very nature of human beings. Whether we are lost in some unknown, remote and harsh region of the world or are behind the brick walls of the concrete jungle, we are all simply trying to survive in this cruel world. Roeg never even gives us a clear idea why the father attempts to kill his children and suicides. Though, that is a clear indication of the fact that the father couldn't survive in the civilized world. He was too weak that is the reason why he gave up his life. This film leaves the complexity of the civilized world (Symbolized by the car burnt down by the father) and follows a journey on the beauty of companionship and purity of life. Yes, Pure is the keyword here. We are transported back to the age when everything was "Pure". The film's wonderful finale is the most powerful testament of this aspect. Sometimes certain situations arose in the film when the children are extremely close at getting discovered and saved by civilized people but aren't. At this point, Roeg's camera briefly focuses on these people and shows us what they are doing. There are certain thought-provoking messages hidden in these scenes which, of course, I will not reveal here and will allow you, my dear readers, to discover it's beauty by yourselves. And then there's the spellbinding cinematography and Roeg's amazing direction. Both capture the wilderness very meticulously and the "pillow shots" (A curious shot where the camera focuses on the surrounding elements, for brief moments, of the environment where the action takes place) makes the film more believable. There are beautiful shots of birds, trees, reptiles, the stark desert, the sunrise/sunset, etc. that fills the film with fresh images of mother nature. Walkabout is a beautiful and complex near-masterpiece film from the land of Australia. Just walk into Walkabout and you won't regret it.

    Had the director just told ONE story & stuck with it, & stop preaching & stop pushing unnecessary themes & images that distract, this could have been WONDERFUL. The awful 1970s soundtrack & overt political themes just get tedious. Making something "artistic" out of what really could have been an emotionally satisfying story ruined it. In fact, ALL EMOTION is lacking in this highly emotional set up. So sad. Terrible movie that could/should be remade by a modern storyteller who knows how to tune into a modern audience would be great.

I want to be able to step through the screen, through time, and go back to the moments I first saw this film and experience the feeling of wonderment and awe I felt then... except I felt them again 40 years later. Selfishly, I also would want to be able to step through the screen and stand with the actors as they scenes are happening, again. It stimulated me to want to be transported... into the scenes, into the presence of the actors, into the Australian countryside, into time. Even the credits reminded me of greatness... Phil Ramone produced the music. A Rod Stewart song. The endlessly beautiful didgeridoo. Hardly clich&eacute;s. These are ephemeral things that speak to us. Which is the point of my review. This is a movie that speaks to us regardless of..... anything. Time. Historical knowledge. Anything. It speaks to us. I want to go Walkabout.

    I wouldn't define this like a drama, it was more like some sort of avant-garde ethnological documentary about Australian aboriginals and their customs or some twisted documentary about reptiles supplemented with nudity scenes to make it more interesting. But if I must accept the fact that it is a drama, then let me tell you this: the plot was very poor, boring and unreal, the performance was mediocre and there was lots of flaws and unnecessary scenes mostly of Jenny Agutter swimming naked (although I must admit it was pleasure to watch her) which did not fit to this movie that trying to call itself drama or adventure. If the editors would cut these scenes the duration of the movie would come down probably to 40 minutes and it wouldn't be that interesting any more :). However it doesn't deserve the rating 7,7 and it is a waste of time to watch it. I was expecting much more after reading the reviews full of "laudes".

    THE SPOILER IS THAT THIS IS TERRIBLE! If I could give this any lower of a rating out of 10 I would. It seriously was the worst movie I have ever seen. It started with terrible actors who seriously could not act to save their lives. No emotion was shown and there was no drama expressed which forced the already terrible storyline into sub zero standards. I implore you to NEVER watch this! Who ever boosted this rating up to a 7.7 must have been smoking something really strong because I have no more faith in society if people honestly believe this could possibly have scored anything above 1. Furthermore I have lost all faith in the Australian film industry, as an Australian I am proud of my heritage and have only the highest respect for the original owners of my land. However, this movie does no one nor anything ANY justice! If the producers were anything but the stupidest people in the world they would stop creating any more copies of this film. This movie's only positive aspect is that it can be studied in English class, where I'm sure, and I hope, every students falls asleep in absolute boredom. Kind Regards, a respected movie critic.

    Beautiful. Just beautiful. When I was expecting another particular survival story, Roeg showed me an amazingly peculiar one. Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself. With no means of transport and no civilized humans around, the kids simply head out into the wilderness. They soon encounter an Aborigine boy who's on a "Walkabout": an Aborigine ritual which involves surviving in the wild for months with the aid of hunting skills after the adolescent reaches a certain age. Thence begins a beautiful and pure journey where the three characters try to outlive the harsh environment with the hunting skills the Aborigine boy possesses. Right at this moment, I am spellbound by this film's images and I will admit that I got to witness a new face of cinema today. Instead of showing us a sweet conventional survival story, Director Nicholas Roeg dwells on narrating the story in a different and thought-provoking manner. The film has been given a complex and layered narration that is a bit ambiguous. Through smart editing and significant number of freeze frames the director, during the Walkabout journey, tries to compare the two completely different cultures of men. One scene is particularly my favorite where the film alternates between the Aborigine boy butchering a Kangaroo and a butcher in some civilized city doing the same. These astonishing moments question the very nature of human beings. Whether we are lost in some unknown, remote and harsh region of the world or are behind the brick walls of the concrete jungle, we are all simply trying to survive in this cruel world. Roeg never even gives us a clear idea why the father attempts to kill his children and suicides. Though, that is a clear indication of the fact that the father couldn't survive in the civilized world. He was too weak that is the reason why he gave up his life. This film leaves the complexity of the civilized world (Symbolized by the car burnt down by the father) and follows a journey on the beauty of companionship and purity of life. Yes, Pure is the keyword here. We are transported back to the age when everything was "Pure". The film's wonderful finale is the most powerful testament of this aspect. Sometimes certain situations arose in the film when the children are extremely close at getting discovered and saved by civilized people but aren't. At this point, Roeg's camera briefly focuses on these people and shows us what they are doing. There are certain thought-provoking messages hidden in these scenes which, of course, I will not reveal here and will allow you, my dear readers, to discover it's beauty by yourselves. And then there's the spellbinding cinematography and Roeg's amazing direction. Both capture the wilderness very meticulously and the "pillow shots" (A curious shot where the camera focuses on the surrounding elements, for brief moments, of the environment where the action takes place) makes the film more believable. There are beautiful shots of birds, trees, reptiles, the stark desert, the sunrise/sunset, etc. that fills the film with fresh images of mother nature. Walkabout is a beautiful and complex near-masterpiece film from the land of Australia. Just walk into Walkabout and you won't regret it.

    Had the director just told ONE story & stuck with it, & stop preaching & stop pushing unnecessary themes & images that distract, this could have been WONDERFUL. The awful 1970s soundtrack & overt political themes just get tedious. Making something "artistic" out of what really could have been an emotionally satisfying story ruined it. In fact, ALL EMOTION is lacking in this highly emotional set up. So sad. Terrible movie that could/should be remade by a modern storyteller who knows how to tune into a modern audience would be great. Whatever the political agenda, it was lost amidst the attempts to manipulate.

    I first saw WALKABOUT at an impressionable age and it has stayed with me ever since, not least for its haunting scenes of animal killing and desolation in the Australian outback. WALKABOUT, Nicolas Roeg's masterful exploration of Australia and the people who inhabit it, is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. Roeg brings the harshness of the environment to life in a series of devastating shots that reveal the true heart of the country. His is a world of scorched deserts littered with the corpses of hunted creatures and inhabited by only the brave or foolhardy. In many ways, this is a horror film, bookended by gruesome death and yet containing some moments of pure joy within. The plot is simple: a schoolgirl and her younger brother are lost in the Outback and forced to fend for themselves in a hostile environment. Along the way, they meet up with an Aborigine (played by David Gulpilil, giving a truly great performance of real depth) and the rest of the film chronicles their adventures. Roeg uses this as a basis to explore numerous themes, from the plight of the oppressed indigenous peoples to the contrast between civilisation and the wilderness (to give you a clue, one is utterly condemned and the other fully embraced). Agutter plays a prim and proper, slightly irritating character but Lucien John is excellent as the boy and as previously mentioned, Gulpilil steals every scene he's in. WALKABOUT is one of my favourite films and a real visual experience that transcends cinematic boundaries to become a work of pure art.

    English cinematographer and director Nicolas Roeg's second feature film which was written by English theatre director, poet, theorist, playwright and screenwriter Edward Bond, is loosely based on English author David Gordon Payne alias James Vance Marshall's book from 1959 and premiered In Competition at the 24th Cannes International Film festival in 1971. It was shot entirely on location in Sydney, Australia and is a UK production which was produced by Si Litvinoff. It tells the story about a father who one day goes on a picnic in the Australian wilderness with his two adolescent children. What the children thinks is going be a nice picnic, suddenly turns into a battle for survival when their father pulls out a gun and starts shooting at them. The schoolgirl grabs a hold of her younger brother and manages to hide them behind a rock, but after hearing that her father's car explodes and seeing that he shoots himself, she realizes that they are left to themselves. Intending to get back to Adelaide where they live, the two of them begins to walk into the wilderness and gets lost. The siblings are surrounded by crawling animals, worn-out by the heat and are becoming dehydrated, but suddenly they notice an aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout coming towards them. Acutely and engagingly directed by British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg in the first film he directed on his own, this surreal and ethereal fictional tale draws an exceedingly mysterious portrayal of an abandoned brother and sister's eventful journey of discovery through the Australian wilderness and their encounter with a young aboriginal man. While notable for it's distinct and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Nicolas Roeg, fine editing by British film editor Antony Gibbs and use of sound, this character-driven and finely tuned adventure drama which was executively produced by American producer Max L. Raab (1925-2008) examines themes like coming-of-age, human relations and cultural differences and contains a great score by English composer John Barry (1933-2011). This sparse study of character which is set against the backdrop of the Australian outback and where two siblings are looking for a way to get back to their home, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent and fragmented narrative structure, substantial character development, minimal dialog and the unconventional acting performances by English television and film actress Jenny Agutter, producer and Nicolas Roeg's son Luc Roeg in his debut feature film role and Indigenous Australian actor and traditional dancer David Gulpilil in his debut feature film role. A poignantly atmospheric, memorable and esoteric independent film from the early period of the Australian New Wave in the early 1970s.

    Walkabout is an unusual film; there are few characters and we never learn the names of those. Set in Australia a father drives into the outback with his teenaged daughter and young son; as the boy plays and the girl prepares a picnic the man starts shooting at them. The girl grabs her brother and they take cover; unable to kill his children the man sets fire to his car before shooting himself. This leaves the two children lost deep in the outback with no idea where the nearest town is or even where there is a road. They head off together heading for high ground hoping that they might see a sign of civilisation. They can't see anything so set off again and eventually find an isolated fruit tree next to a small waterhole. They eat and drink before going to sleep; by the time they awaken the water has dried up and the birds have stripped the fruit. It looks as if they will die here until an aboriginal boy finds them. He doesn't speak a word of English and they don't speak his language but he lets them tag along with him and shares the food he finds with them. Ultimately they find a farm but it has long since been abandoned; it is however near a road and that will inevitably lead the two siblings back to civilisation whatever that is. This is one of those films that viewers are likely to declare a masterpiece or terrible; I'm inclined to the former view. There is something strange about it; director Nicolas Roeg has filmed it in a way that makes the landscape both beautiful and ugly at the same time; the camera often cuts away to show wildlife; sometimes alive other times dead and decaying. The landscape they walk through often feels so dry one gets thirsty just looking at it. When they meet the young aborigine his language is left unsubtitled so it is as alien to the viewer as it is to the two siblings. As the three of them travel together the aborigine hunts and kills several animals; we also see a white hunter shooting and cutting open a water buffalo; these scenes might disturb some viewers as they look real. Given the '12' certificate some viewers might be a little surprised to see Jenny Agutter, who was sixteen at the time of filming, totally naked; the scenes are innocent though so shouldn't offend anybody. That isn't to say there is nothing sexual about the film; the way she looked at the Aboriginal boy showed that she was coming to terms with her burgeoning sexuality even if she never acted on those feelings. While not everybody will enjoy this film I think it is one of those that all film fans should watch once; even if you don't enjoy it there are interesting things to be seen.

    I have seen this film dozens of times, more or less since it first appeared on TV in the mid 70s, and each time see more in it - perhaps a reflection that, as I the viewer get older, I understand more of what is being suggested. You start with the nature (an it is glorious), and then the political undercurrent, perhaps the unspoken sexual imagery, the communication failure, the cultural misunderstandings, the wisdom of the white boy (younger and more open to new ideas), and so on. Many other reviewers have commented on the same. One thing that I notice on my latest viewing. Compare the images of the waterhole halfway through, with the images at the end, when The Girl "remembers" them. They are different - very different. The Girl swims alone in the former, but at the end she is with her brother and the aboriginal boy. They communicate and smile with each other - which almost never happens in the main film where The Girl in particular barely attempts to get to know her guide and saviour. And then the quotation. Is the director also saying here that these memories - that maybe all memory - is idealised? That Nostalgia - what we "remember" - is what we want to, even if - in truth - it never happened that way? That The Girl is wanting to return to a past - the Land of Lost Content - that never actually was? As I say, its a beautiful, wonderful film that would be impossible to make today for half a hundred reasons - and a film that can be watched a dozen times, and still appear fresh. Both simple, and complex with layer upon layer. A masterpiece.

    Two young children are stranded in the Australian outback and are forced to cope on their own. They meet an Aborigine on "walkabout": a ritualistic separation from his tribe. Louis Nowra wrote, "I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting." I could not agree more -- National Geographic cannot make a film more rich and vibrant than this. Roger Ebert asked rhetorically, "Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication." Is he on to something? I do not know... there is definitely a communication element -- its importance is debatable.

    ... to my youth. I saw this film when it first came out, and my hormones were just starting to spiral. Much of what was being presented I did not understand because of my youth, and it made deep deep sense. No, not an oxymoron. A more clich&eacute;'d response would be it resonated with me. Clich&eacute;s and me aside... this is a beautiful tone poem. I just saw it again after years and it was so deeply impressionable then, the sense of awe and fulfillment came rushing back each scene. My partner asked me why did the father start shooting at the children? Why did he commit suicide (sorry, spoiler)? Why this? Why that? I kept saying to sit back and let it waft in like a breeze. It is a tone poem. Which is my review. It is a tone poem. The segue into finding the ramshackle house in nowhere's-ville says it all. The Ab carrying the radio. The Ab with the preppie jacket wrapped around his waist. The girl barefoot. The young boy barefoot and sunburned. I mean, the metaphors were simultaneously slamming one upside the head like a cast iron skillet, and gentle breezes at the same time. I could go on and on. This is simply one of the great films, ever. It strips away yet simultaneously must utilize modern conventions to convey the story. The sexual references at the same time sledge hammered into the lens yet human beings are wired to respond to these slices of life. The only thing wish is for me, and yes it is a selfish aspect of the review, for me... I want to be able to step through the screen, through time, and go back to the moments I first saw this film and experience the feeling of wonderment and awe I felt then... except I felt them again 40 years later.

This is a movie that speaks to us regardless of..... anything. Time. Historical knowledge. Anything. It speaks to us. I want to go Walkabout.

    Walkabout is an unusual film; there are few characters and we never learn the names of those. Set in Australia a father drives into the outback with his teenaged daughter and young son; as the boy plays and the girl prepares a picnic the man starts shooting at them. The girl grabs her brother and they take cover; unable to kill his children the man sets fire to his car before shooting himself. This leaves the two children lost deep in the outback with no idea where the nearest town is or even where there is a road. They head off together heading for high ground hoping that they might see a sign of civilisation. They can't see anything so set off again and eventually find an isolated fruit tree next to a small waterhole. They eat and drink before going to sleep; by the time they awaken the water has dried up and the birds have stripped the fruit. It looks as if they will die here until an aboriginal boy finds them. He doesn't speak a word of English and they don't speak his language but he lets them tag along with him and shares the food he finds with them. Ultimately they find a farm but it has long since been abandoned; it is however near a road and that will inevitably lead the two siblings back to civilisation whatever that is. This is one of those films that viewers are likely to declare a masterpiece or terrible; I'm inclined to the former view. There is something strange about it; director Nicolas Roeg has filmed it in a way that makes the landscape both beautiful and ugly at the same time; the camera often cuts away to show wildlife; sometimes alive other times dead and decaying. The landscape they walk through often feels so dry one gets thirsty just looking at it. When they meet the young aborigine his language is left unsubtitled so it is as alien to the viewer as it is to the two siblings. As the three of them travel together the aborigine hunts and kills several animals; we also see a white hunter shooting and cutting open a water buffalo; these scenes might disturb some viewers as they look real. Given the '12' certificate some viewers might be a little surprised to see Jenny Agutter, who was sixteen at the time of filming, totally naked; the scenes are innocent though so shouldn't offend anybody. That isn't to say there is nothing sexual about the film; the way she looked at the Aboriginal boy showed that she was coming to terms with her burgeoning sexuality even if she never acted on those feelings. While not everybody will enjoy this film I think it is one of those that all film fans should watch once; even if you don't enjoy it there are interesting things to be seen.

    I have seen this film dozens of times, more or less since it first appeared on TV in the mid 70s, and each time see more in it - perhaps a reflection that, as I the viewer get older, I understand more of what is being suggested. You start with the nature (an it is glorious), and then the political undercurrent, perhaps the unspoken sexual imagery, the communication failure, the cultural misunderstandings, the wisdom of the white boy (younger and more open to new ideas), and so on. Many other reviewers have commented on the same. One thing that I notice on my latest viewing. Compare the images of the waterhole halfway through, with the images at the end, when The Girl "remembers" them. They are different - very different. The Girl swims alone in the former, but at the end she is with her brother and the aboriginal boy. They communicate and smile with each other - which almost never happens in the main film where The Girl in particular barely attempts to get to know her guide and saviour. And then the quotation. Is the director also saying here that these memories - that maybe all memory - is idealised? That Nostalgia - what we "remember" - is what we want to, even if - in truth - it never happened that way? That The Girl is wanting to return to a past - the Land of Lost Content - that never actually was? As I say, its a beautiful, wonderful film that would be impossible to make today for half a hundred reasons - and a film that can be watched a dozen times, and still appear fresh. Both simple, and complex with layer upon layer. A masterpiece.

    Two young children are stranded in the Australian outback and are forced to cope on their own. They meet an Aborigine on "walkabout": a ritualistic separation from his tribe. Louis Nowra wrote, "I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting." I could not agree more -- National Geographic cannot make a film more rich and vibrant than this. Roger Ebert asked rhetorically, "Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication." Is he on to something? I do not know... there is definitely a communication element -- its importance is debatable.

    ... to my youth. I saw this film when it first came out, and my hormones were just starting to spiral. Much of what was being presented I did not understand because of my youth, and it made deep deep sense. No, not an oxymoron. A more clich&eacute;'d response would be it resonated with me. Clich&eacute;s and me aside... this is a beautiful tone poem. I just saw it again after years and it was so deeply impressionable then, the sense of awe and fulfillment came rushing back each scene. My partner asked me why did the father start shooting at the children? Why did he commit suicide (sorry, spoiler)? Why this? Why that? I kept saying to sit back and let it waft in like a breeze. It is a tone poem. Which is my review. It is a tone poem. The segue into finding the ramshackle house in nowhere's-ville says it all. The Ab carrying the radio. The Ab with the preppie jacket wrapped around his waist. The girl barefoot. The young boy barefoot and sunburned. I mean, the metaphors were simultaneously slamming one upside the head like a cast iron skillet, and gentle breezes at the same time. I could go on and on. This is simply one of the great films, ever. It strips away yet simultaneously must utilize modern conventions to convey the story. The sexual references at the same time sledge hammered into the lens yet human beings are wired to respond to these slices of life. The only thing wish is for me, and yes it is a selfish aspect of the review, for me... I want to be able to step through the screen, through time, and go back to the moments I first saw this film and experience the feeling of wonderment and awe I felt then... except I felt them again 40 years later. Selfishly, I also would want to be able to step through the screen and stand with the actors as they scenes are happening, again. It stimulated me to want to be transported... into the scenes, into the presence of the actors, into the Australian countryside, into time. Even the credits reminded me of greatness... Phil Ramone produced the music. A Rod Stewart song. The endlessly beautiful didgeridoo. Hardly clich&eacute;s. These are ephemeral things that speak to us. Which is the point of my review. This is a movie that speaks to us regardless of..... anything. Time. Historical knowledge. Anything. It speaks to us. I want to go Walkabout.

    I wouldn't define this like a drama, it was more like some sort of avant-garde ethnological documentary about Australian aboriginals and their customs or some twisted documentary about reptiles supplemented with nudity scenes to make it more interesting. But if I must accept the fact that it is a drama, then let me tell you this: the plot was very poor, boring and unreal, the performance was mediocre and there was lots of flaws and unnecessary scenes mostly of Jenny Agutter swimming naked (although I must admit it was pleasure to watch her) which did not fit to this movie that trying to call itself drama or adventure. If the editors would cut these scenes the duration of the movie would come down probably to 40 minutes and it wouldn't be that interesting any more :). However it doesn't deserve the rating 7,7 and it is a waste of time to watch it. I was expecting much more after reading the reviews full of "laudes".

    THE SPOILER IS THAT THIS IS TERRIBLE! If I could give this any lower of a rating out of 10 I would. It seriously was the worst movie I have ever seen. It started with terrible actors who seriously could not act to save their lives. No emotion was shown and there was no drama expressed which forced the already terrible storyline into sub zero standards. I implore you to NEVER watch this! Who ever boosted this rating up to a 7.7 must have been smoking something really strong because I have no more faith in society if people honestly believe this could possibly have scored anything above 1. Furthermore I have lost all faith in the Australian film industry, as an Australian I am proud of my heritage and have only the highest respect for the original owners of my land. However, this movie does no one nor anything ANY justice! If the producers were anything but the stupidest people in the world they would stop creating any more copies of this film. This movie's only positive aspect is that it can be studied in English class, where I'm sure, and I hope, every students falls asleep in absolute boredom. Kind Regards, a respected movie critic.

    Beautiful. Just beautiful. When I was expecting another particular survival story, Roeg showed me an amazingly peculiar one. Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself. With no means of transport and no civilized humans around, the kids simply head out into the wilderness. They soon encounter an Aborigine boy who's on a "Walkabout": an Aborigine ritual which involves surviving in the wild for months with the aid of hunting skills after the adolescent reaches a certain age. Thence begins a beautiful and pure journey where the three characters try to outlive the harsh environment with the hunting skills the Aborigine boy possesses. Right at this moment, I am spellbound by this film's images and I will admit that I got to witness a new face of cinema today. Instead of showing us a sweet conventional survival story, Director Nicholas Roeg dwells on narrating the story in a different and thought-provoking manner. The film has been given a complex and layered narration that is a bit ambiguous. Through smart editing and significant number of freeze frames the director, during the Walkabout journey, tries to compare the two completely different cultures of men. One scene is particularly my favorite where the film alternates between the Aborigine boy butchering a Kangaroo and a butcher in some civilized city doing the same. These astonishing moments question the very nature of human beings. Whether we are lost in some unknown, remote and harsh region of the world or are behind the brick walls of the concrete jungle, we are all simply trying to survive in this cruel world. Roeg never even gives us a clear idea why the father attempts to kill his children and suicides. Though, that is a clear indication of the fact that the father couldn't survive in the civilized world. He was too weak that is the reason why he gave up his life. This film leaves the complexity of the civilized world (Symbolized by the car burnt down by the father) and follows a journey on the beauty of companionship and purity of life. Yes, Pure is the keyword here. We are transported back to the age when everything was "Pure". The film's wonderful finale is the most powerful testament of this aspect. Sometimes certain situations arose in the film when the children are extremely close at getting discovered and saved by civilized people but aren't. At this point, Roeg's camera briefly focuses on these people and shows us what they are doing. There are certain thought-provoking messages hidden in these scenes which, of course, I will not reveal here and will allow you, my dear readers, to discover it's beauty by yourselves. And then there's the spellbinding cinematography and Roeg's amazing direction. Both capture the wilderness very meticulously and the "pillow shots" (A curious shot where the camera focuses on the surrounding elements, for brief moments, of the environment where the action takes place) makes the film more believable. There are beautiful shots of birds, trees, reptiles, the stark desert, the sunrise/sunset, etc. that fills the film with fresh images of mother nature. Walkabout is a beautiful and complex near-masterpiece film from the land of Australia. Just walk into Walkabout and you won't regret it.

    Had the director just told ONE story & stuck with it, & stop preaching & stop pushing unnecessary themes & images that distract, this could have been WONDERFUL. The awful 1970s soundtrack & overt political themes just get tedious. Making something "artistic" out of what really could have been an emotionally satisfying story ruined it. In fact, ALL EMOTION is lacking in this highly emotional set up. So sad. Terrible movie that could/should be remade by a modern storyteller who knows how to tune into a modern audience would be great. Whatever the political agenda, it was lost amidst the attempts to manipulate.

    I first saw WALKABOUT at an impressionable age and it has stayed with me ever since, not least for its haunting scenes of animal killing and desolation in the Australian outback. WALKABOUT, Nicolas Roeg's masterful exploration of Australia and the people who inhabit it, is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. Roeg brings the harshness of the environment to life in a series of devastating shots that reveal the true heart of the country. His is a world of scorched deserts littered with the corpses of hunted creatures and inhabited by only the brave or foolhardy. In many ways, this is a horror film, bookended by gruesome death and yet containing some moments of pure joy within. The plot is simple: a schoolgirl and her younger brother are lost in the Outback and forced to fend for themselves in a hostile environment. Along the way, they meet up with an Aborigine (played by David Gulpilil, giving a truly great performance of real depth) and the rest of the film chronicles their adventures. Roeg uses this as a basis to explore numerous themes, from the plight of the oppressed indigenous peoples to the contrast between civilisation and the wilderness (to give you a clue, one is utterly condemned and the other fully embraced). Agutter plays a prim and proper, slightly irritating character but Lucien John is excellent as the boy and as previously mentioned, Gulpilil steals every scene he's in. WALKABOUT is one of my favourite films and a real visual experience that transcends cinematic boundaries to become a work of pure art.

    English cinematographer and director Nicolas Roeg's second feature film which was written by English theatre director, poet, theorist, playwright and screenwriter Edward Bond, is loosely based on English author David Gordon Payne alias James Vance Marshall's book from 1959 and premiered In Competition at the 24th Cannes International Film festival in 1971. It was shot entirely on location in Sydney, Australia and is a UK production which was produced by Si Litvinoff. It tells the story about a father who one day goes on a picnic in the Australian wilderness with his two adolescent children. What the children thinks is going be a nice picnic, suddenly turns into a battle for survival when their father pulls out a gun and starts shooting at them. The schoolgirl grabs a hold of her younger brother and manages to hide them behind a rock, but after hearing that her father's car explodes and seeing that he shoots himself, she realizes that they are left to themselves. Intending to get back to Adelaide where they live, the two of them begins to walk into the wilderness and gets lost. The siblings are surrounded by crawling animals, worn-out by the heat and are becoming dehydrated, but suddenly they notice an aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout coming towards them. Acutely and engagingly directed by British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg in the first film he directed on his own, this surreal and ethereal fictional tale draws an exceedingly mysterious portrayal of an abandoned brother and sister's eventful journey of discovery through the Australian wilderness and their encounter with a young aboriginal man. While notable for it's distinct and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Nicolas Roeg, fine editing by British film editor Antony Gibbs and use of sound, this character-driven and finely tuned adventure drama which was executively produced by American producer Max L. Raab (1925-2008) examines themes like coming-of-age, human relations and cultural differences and contains a great score by English composer John Barry (1933-2011). This sparse study of character which is set against the backdrop of the Australian outback and where two siblings are looking for a way to get back to their home, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent and fragmented narrative structure, substantial character development, minimal dialog and the unconventional acting performances by English television and film actress Jenny Agutter, producer and Nicolas Roeg's son Luc Roeg in his debut feature film role and Indigenous Australian actor and traditional dancer David Gulpilil in his debut feature film role. A poignantly atmospheric, memorable and esoteric independent film from the early period of the Australian New Wave in the early 1970s.

    Beautiful. Just beautiful. When I was expecting another particular survival story, Roeg showed me an amazingly peculiar one. Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself.

One scene is particularly my favorite where the film alternates between the Aborigine boy butchering a Kangaroo and a butcher in some civilized city doing the same. These astonishing moments question the very nature of human beings. Whether we are lost in some unknown, remote and harsh region of the world or are behind the brick walls of the concrete jungle, we are all simply trying to survive in this cruel world. Roeg never even gives us a clear idea why the father attempts to kill his children and suicides. Though, that is a clear indication of the fact that the father couldn't survive in the civilized world. He was too weak that is the reason why he gave up his life. This film leaves the complexity of the civilized world (Symbolized by the car burnt down by the father) and follows a journey on the beauty of companionship and purity of life. Yes, Pure is the keyword here. We are transported back to the age when everything was "Pure". The film's wonderful finale is the most powerful testament of this aspect. Sometimes certain situations arose in the film when the children are extremely close at getting discovered and saved by civilized people but aren't. At this point, Roeg's camera briefly focuses on these people and shows us what they are doing. There are certain thought-provoking messages hidden in these scenes which, of course, I will not reveal here and will allow you, my dear readers, to discover it's beauty by yourselves. And then there's the spellbinding cinematography and Roeg's amazing direction. Both capture the wilderness very meticulously and the "pillow shots" (A curious shot where the camera focuses on the surrounding elements, for brief moments, of the environment where the action takes place) makes the film more believable. There are beautiful shots of birds, trees, reptiles, the stark desert, the sunrise/sunset, etc. that fills the film with fresh images of mother nature. Walkabout is a beautiful and complex near-masterpiece film from the land of Australia. Just walk into Walkabout and you won't regret it.

    Had the director just told ONE story & stuck with it, & stop preaching & stop pushing unnecessary themes & images that distract, this could have been WONDERFUL. The awful 1970s soundtrack & overt political themes just get tedious. Making something "artistic" out of what really could have been an emotionally satisfying story ruined it. In fact, ALL EMOTION is lacking in this highly emotional set up. So sad. Terrible movie that could/should be remade by a modern storyteller who knows how to tune into a modern audience would be great. Whatever the political agenda, it was lost amidst the attempts to manipulate.

    I first saw WALKABOUT at an impressionable age and it has stayed with me ever since, not least for its haunting scenes of animal killing and desolation in the Australian outback. WALKABOUT, Nicolas Roeg's masterful exploration of Australia and the people who inhabit it, is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. Roeg brings the harshness of the environment to life in a series of devastating shots that reveal the true heart of the country. His is a world of scorched deserts littered with the corpses of hunted creatures and inhabited by only the brave or foolhardy. In many ways, this is a horror film, bookended by gruesome death and yet containing some moments of pure joy within. The plot is simple: a schoolgirl and her younger brother are lost in the Outback and forced to fend for themselves in a hostile environment. Along the way, they meet up with an Aborigine (played by David Gulpilil, giving a truly great performance of real depth) and the rest of the film chronicles their adventures. Roeg uses this as a basis to explore numerous themes, from the plight of the oppressed indigenous peoples to the contrast between civilisation and the wilderness (to give you a clue, one is utterly condemned and the other fully embraced). Agutter plays a prim and proper, slightly irritating character but Lucien John is excellent as the boy and as previously mentioned, Gulpilil steals every scene he's in. WALKABOUT is one of my favourite films and a real visual experience that transcends cinematic boundaries to become a work of pure art.

    English cinematographer and director Nicolas Roeg's second feature film which was written by English theatre director, poet, theorist, playwright and screenwriter Edward Bond, is loosely based on English author David Gordon Payne alias James Vance Marshall's book from 1959 and premiered In Competition at the 24th Cannes International Film festival in 1971. It was shot entirely on location in Sydney, Australia and is a UK production which was produced by Si Litvinoff. It tells the story about a father who one day goes on a picnic in the Australian wilderness with his two adolescent children. What the children thinks is going be a nice picnic, suddenly turns into a battle for survival when their father pulls out a gun and starts shooting at them. The schoolgirl grabs a hold of her younger brother and manages to hide them behind a rock, but after hearing that her father's car explodes and seeing that he shoots himself, she realizes that they are left to themselves. Intending to get back to Adelaide where they live, the two of them begins to walk into the wilderness and gets lost. The siblings are surrounded by crawling animals, worn-out by the heat and are becoming dehydrated, but suddenly they notice an aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout coming towards them. Acutely and engagingly directed by British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg in the first film he directed on his own, this surreal and ethereal fictional tale draws an exceedingly mysterious portrayal of an abandoned brother and sister's eventful journey of discovery through the Australian wilderness and their encounter with a young aboriginal man. While notable for it's distinct and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Nicolas Roeg, fine editing by British film editor Antony Gibbs and use of sound, this character-driven and finely tuned adventure drama which was executively produced by American producer Max L. Raab (1925-2008) examines themes like coming-of-age, human relations and cultural differences and contains a great score by English composer John Barry (1933-2011). This sparse study of character which is set against the backdrop of the Australian outback and where two siblings are looking for a way to get back to their home, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent and fragmented narrative structure, substantial character development, minimal dialog and the unconventional acting performances by English television and film actress Jenny Agutter, producer and Nicolas Roeg's son Luc Roeg in his debut feature film role and Indigenous Australian actor and traditional dancer David Gulpilil in his debut feature film role. A poignantly atmospheric, memorable and esoteric independent film from the early period of the Australian New Wave in the early 1970s.

    Walkabout is an unusual film; there are few characters and we never learn the names of those. Set in Australia a father drives into the outback with his teenaged daughter and young son; as the boy plays and the girl prepares a picnic the man starts shooting at them. The girl grabs her brother and they take cover; unable to kill his children the man sets fire to his car before shooting himself. This leaves the two children lost deep in the outback with no idea where the nearest town is or even where there is a road. They head off together heading for high ground hoping that they might see a sign of civilisation. They can't see anything so set off again and eventually find an isolated fruit tree next to a small waterhole. They eat and drink before going to sleep; by the time they awaken the water has dried up and the birds have stripped the fruit. It looks as if they will die here until an aboriginal boy finds them. He doesn't speak a word of English and they don't speak his language but he lets them tag along with him and shares the food he finds with them. Ultimately they find a farm but it has long since been abandoned; it is however near a road and that will inevitably lead the two siblings back to civilisation whatever that is. This is one of those films that viewers are likely to declare a masterpiece or terrible; I'm inclined to the former view. There is something strange about it; director Nicolas Roeg has filmed it in a way that makes the landscape both beautiful and ugly at the same time; the camera often cuts away to show wildlife; sometimes alive other times dead and decaying. The landscape they walk through often feels so dry one gets thirsty just looking at it. When they meet the young aborigine his language is left unsubtitled so it is as alien to the viewer as it is to the two siblings. As the three of them travel together the aborigine hunts and kills several animals; we also see a white hunter shooting and cutting open a water buffalo; these scenes might disturb some viewers as they look real. Given the '12' certificate some viewers might be a little surprised to see Jenny Agutter, who was sixteen at the time of filming, totally naked; the scenes are innocent though so shouldn't offend anybody. That isn't to say there is nothing sexual about the film; the way she looked at the Aboriginal boy showed that she was coming to terms with her burgeoning sexuality even if she never acted on those feelings. While not everybody will enjoy this film I think it is one of those that all film fans should watch once; even if you don't enjoy it there are interesting things to be seen.

    I have seen this film dozens of times, more or less since it first appeared on TV in the mid 70s, and each time see more in it - perhaps a reflection that, as I the viewer get older, I understand more of what is being suggested. You start with the nature (an it is glorious), and then the political undercurrent, perhaps the unspoken sexual imagery, the communication failure, the cultural misunderstandings, the wisdom of the white boy (younger and more open to new ideas), and so on. Many other reviewers have commented on the same. One thing that I notice on my latest viewing. Compare the images of the waterhole halfway through, with the images at the end, when The Girl "remembers" them. They are different - very different. The Girl swims alone in the former, but at the end she is with her brother and the aboriginal boy. They communicate and smile with each other - which almost never happens in the main film where The Girl in particular barely attempts to get to know her guide and saviour. And then the quotation. Is the director also saying here that these memories - that maybe all memory - is idealised? That Nostalgia - what we "remember" - is what we want to, even if - in truth - it never happened that way? That The Girl is wanting to return to a past - the Land of Lost Content - that never actually was? As I say, its a beautiful, wonderful film that would be impossible to make today for half a hundred reasons - and a film that can be watched a dozen times, and still appear fresh. Both simple, and complex with layer upon layer. A masterpiece.

    Two young children are stranded in the Australian outback and are forced to cope on their own. They meet an Aborigine on "walkabout": a ritualistic separation from his tribe. Louis Nowra wrote, "I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting." I could not agree more -- National Geographic cannot make a film more rich and vibrant than this. Roger Ebert asked rhetorically, "Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication." Is he on to something? I do not know... there is definitely a communication element -- its importance is debatable.

    ... to my youth. I saw this film when it first came out, and my hormones were just starting to spiral. Much of what was being presented I did not understand because of my youth, and it made deep deep sense. No, not an oxymoron. A more clich&eacute;'d response would be it resonated with me. Clich&eacute;s and me aside... this is a beautiful tone poem. I just saw it again after years and it was so deeply impressionable then, the sense of awe and fulfillment came rushing back each scene. My partner asked me why did the father start shooting at the children? Why did he commit suicide (sorry, spoiler)? Why this? Why that? I kept saying to sit back and let it waft in like a breeze. It is a tone poem. Which is my review. It is a tone poem. The segue into finding the ramshackle house in nowhere's-ville says it all. The Ab carrying the radio. The Ab with the preppie jacket wrapped around his waist. The girl barefoot. The young boy barefoot and sunburned. I mean, the metaphors were simultaneously slamming one upside the head like a cast iron skillet, and gentle breezes at the same time. I could go on and on. This is simply one of the great films, ever. It strips away yet simultaneously must utilize modern conventions to convey the story. The sexual references at the same time sledge hammered into the lens yet human beings are wired to respond to these slices of life. The only thing wish is for me, and yes it is a selfish aspect of the review, for me... I want to be able to step through the screen, through time, and go back to the moments I first saw this film and experience the feeling of wonderment and awe I felt then... except I felt them again 40 years later. Selfishly, I also would want to be able to step through the screen and stand with the actors as they scenes are happening, again. It stimulated me to want to be transported... into the scenes, into the presence of the actors, into the Australian countryside, into time. Even the credits reminded me of greatness... Phil Ramone produced the music. A Rod Stewart song. The endlessly beautiful didgeridoo. Hardly clich&eacute;s. These are ephemeral things that speak to us. Which is the point of my review. This is a movie that speaks to us regardless of..... anything. Time. Historical knowledge. Anything. It speaks to us. I want to go Walkabout.

    I wouldn't define this like a drama, it was more like some sort of avant-garde ethnological documentary about Australian aboriginals and their customs or some twisted documentary about reptiles supplemented with nudity scenes to make it more interesting. But if I must accept the fact that it is a drama, then let me tell you this: the plot was very poor, boring and unreal, the performance was mediocre and there was lots of flaws and unnecessary scenes mostly of Jenny Agutter swimming naked (although I must admit it was pleasure to watch her) which did not fit to this movie that trying to call itself drama or adventure. If the editors would cut these scenes the duration of the movie would come down probably to 40 minutes and it wouldn't be that interesting any more :). However it doesn't deserve the rating 7,7 and it is a waste of time to watch it. I was expecting much more after reading the reviews full of "laudes".

    THE SPOILER IS THAT THIS IS TERRIBLE! If I could give this any lower of a rating out of 10 I would. It seriously was the worst movie I have ever seen. It started with terrible actors who seriously could not act to save their lives. No emotion was shown and there was no drama expressed which forced the already terrible storyline into sub zero standards. I implore you to NEVER watch this! Who ever boosted this rating up to a 7.7 must have been smoking something really strong because I have no more faith in society if people honestly believe this could possibly have scored anything above 1. Furthermore I have lost all faith in the Australian film industry, as an Australian I am proud of my heritage and have only the highest respect for the original owners of my land. However, this movie does no one nor anything ANY justice! If the producers were anything but the stupidest people in the world they would stop creating any more copies of this film. This movie's only positive aspect is that it can be studied in English class, where I'm sure, and I hope, every students falls asleep in absolute boredom. Kind Regards, a respected movie critic.

    Beautiful. Just beautiful. When I was expecting another particular survival story, Roeg showed me an amazingly peculiar one. Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself. With no means of transport and no civilized humans around, the kids simply head out into the wilderness. They soon encounter an Aborigine boy who's on a "Walkabout": an Aborigine ritual which involves surviving in the wild for months with the aid of hunting skills after the adolescent reaches a certain age. Thence begins a beautiful and pure journey where the three characters try to outlive the harsh environment with the hunting skills the Aborigine boy possesses. Right at this moment, I am spellbound by this film's images and I will admit that I got to witness a new face of cinema today. Instead of showing us a sweet conventional survival story, Director Nicholas Roeg dwells on narrating the story in a different and thought-provoking manner. The film has been given a complex and layered narration that is a bit ambiguous. Through smart editing and significant number of freeze frames the director, during the Walkabout journey, tries to compare the two completely different cultures of men. One scene is particularly my favorite where the film alternates between the Aborigine boy butchering a Kangaroo and a butcher in some civilized city doing the same. These astonishing moments question the very nature of human beings. Whether we are lost in some unknown, remote and harsh region of the world or are behind the brick walls of the concrete jungle, we are all simply trying to survive in this cruel world. Roeg never even gives us a clear idea why the father attempts to kill his children and suicides. Though, that is a clear indication of the fact that the father couldn't survive in the civilized world. He was too weak that is the reason why he gave up his life. This film leaves the complexity of the civilized world (Symbolized by the car burnt down by the father) and follows a journey on the beauty of companionship and purity of life. Yes, Pure is the keyword here. We are transported back to the age when everything was "Pure". The film's wonderful finale is the most powerful testament of this aspect. Sometimes certain situations arose in the film when the children are extremely close at getting discovered and saved by civilized people but aren't.

There are certain thought-provoking messages hidden in these scenes which, of course, I will not reveal here and will allow you, my dear readers, to discover it's beauty by yourselves.

Both capture the wilderness very meticulously and the "pillow shots" (A curious shot where the camera focuses on the surrounding elements, for brief moments, of the environment where the action takes place) makes the film more believable. There are beautiful shots of birds, trees, reptiles, the stark desert, the sunrise/sunset, etc. that fills the film with fresh images of mother nature. Walkabout is a beautiful and complex near-masterpiece film from the land of Australia. Just walk into Walkabout and you won't regret it.

Louis Nowra wrote, "I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting." I could not agree more -- National Geographic cannot make a film more rich and vibrant than this. Roger Ebert asked rhetorically, "Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication." Is he on to something? I do not know... there is definitely a communication element -- its importance is debatable.

    ... to my youth. I saw this film when it first came out, and my hormones were just starting to spiral. Much of what was being presented I did not understand because of my youth, and it made deep deep sense. No, not an oxymoron. A more clich&eacute;'d response would be it resonated with me. Clich&eacute;s and me aside... this is a beautiful tone poem. I just saw it again after years and it was so deeply impressionable then, the sense of awe and fulfillment came rushing back each scene. My partner asked me why did the father start shooting at the children? Why did he commit suicide (sorry, spoiler)? Why this? Why that? I kept saying to sit back and let it waft in like a breeze. It is a tone poem. Which is my review. It is a tone poem. The segue into finding the ramshackle house in nowhere's-ville says it all. The Ab carrying the radio. The Ab with the preppie jacket wrapped around his waist. The girl barefoot. The young boy barefoot and sunburned. I mean, the metaphors were simultaneously slamming one upside the head like a cast iron skillet, and gentle breezes at the same time. I could go on and on. This is simply one of the great films, ever. It strips away yet simultaneously must utilize modern conventions to convey the story. The sexual references at the same time sledge hammered into the lens yet human beings are wired to respond to these slices of life. The only thing wish is for me, and yes it is a selfish aspect of the review, for me... I want to be able to step through the screen, through time, and go back to the moments I first saw this film and experience the feeling of wonderment and awe I felt then... except I felt them again 40 years later. Selfishly, I also would want to be able to step through the screen and stand with the actors as they scenes are happening, again. It stimulated me to want to be transported... into the scenes, into the presence of the actors, into the Australian countryside, into time. Even the credits reminded me of greatness... Phil Ramone produced the music. A Rod Stewart song. The endlessly beautiful didgeridoo. Hardly clich&eacute;s. These are ephemeral things that speak to us. Which is the point of my review. This is a movie that speaks to us regardless of..... anything. Time. Historical knowledge. Anything. It speaks to us. I want to go Walkabout.

    I wouldn't define this like a drama, it was more like some sort of avant-garde ethnological documentary about Australian aboriginals and their customs or some twisted documentary about reptiles supplemented with nudity scenes to make it more interesting. But if I must accept the fact that it is a drama, then let me tell you this: the plot was very poor, boring and unreal, the performance was mediocre and there was lots of flaws and unnecessary scenes mostly of Jenny Agutter swimming naked (although I must admit it was pleasure to watch her) which did not fit to this movie that trying to call itself drama or adventure. If the editors would cut these scenes the duration of the movie would come down probably to 40 minutes and it wouldn't be that interesting any more :). However it doesn't deserve the rating 7,7 and it is a waste of time to watch it. I was expecting much more after reading the reviews full of "laudes".

    THE SPOILER IS THAT THIS IS TERRIBLE! If I could give this any lower of a rating out of 10 I would. It seriously was the worst movie I have ever seen. It started with terrible actors who seriously could not act to save their lives. No emotion was shown and there was no drama expressed which forced the already terrible storyline into sub zero standards. I implore you to NEVER watch this! Who ever boosted this rating up to a 7.7 must have been smoking something really strong because I have no more faith in society if people honestly believe this could possibly have scored anything above 1. Furthermore I have lost all faith in the Australian film industry, as an Australian I am proud of my heritage and have only the highest respect for the original owners of my land. However, this movie does no one nor anything ANY justice! If the producers were anything but the stupidest people in the world they would stop creating any more copies of this film. This movie's only positive aspect is that it can be studied in English class, where I'm sure, and I hope, every students falls asleep in absolute boredom. Kind Regards, a respected movie critic.

    Beautiful. Just beautiful. When I was expecting another particular survival story, Roeg showed me an amazingly peculiar one. Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself. With no means of transport and no civilized humans around, the kids simply head out into the wilderness. They soon encounter an Aborigine boy who's on a "Walkabout": an Aborigine ritual which involves surviving in the wild for months with the aid of hunting skills after the adolescent reaches a certain age. Thence begins a beautiful and pure journey where the three characters try to outlive the harsh environment with the hunting skills the Aborigine boy possesses. Right at this moment, I am spellbound by this film's images and I will admit that I got to witness a new face of cinema today. Instead of showing us a sweet conventional survival story, Director Nicholas Roeg dwells on narrating the story in a different and thought-provoking manner. The film has been given a complex and layered narration that is a bit ambiguous. Through smart editing and significant number of freeze frames the director, during the Walkabout journey, tries to compare the two completely different cultures of men. One scene is particularly my favorite where the film alternates between the Aborigine boy butchering a Kangaroo and a butcher in some civilized city doing the same. These astonishing moments question the very nature of human beings. Whether we are lost in some unknown, remote and harsh region of the world or are behind the brick walls of the concrete jungle, we are all simply trying to survive in this cruel world. Roeg never even gives us a clear idea why the father attempts to kill his children and suicides. Though, that is a clear indication of the fact that the father couldn't survive in the civilized world. He was too weak that is the reason why he gave up his life. This film leaves the complexity of the civilized world (Symbolized by the car burnt down by the father) and follows a journey on the beauty of companionship and purity of life. Yes, Pure is the keyword here. We are transported back to the age when everything was "Pure". The film's wonderful finale is the most powerful testament of this aspect. Sometimes certain situations arose in the film when the children are extremely close at getting discovered and saved by civilized people but aren't. At this point, Roeg's camera briefly focuses on these people and shows us what they are doing. There are certain thought-provoking messages hidden in these scenes which, of course, I will not reveal here and will allow you, my dear readers, to discover it's beauty by yourselves. And then there's the spellbinding cinematography and Roeg's amazing direction. Both capture the wilderness very meticulously and the "pillow shots" (A curious shot where the camera focuses on the surrounding elements, for brief moments, of the environment where the action takes place) makes the film more believable. There are beautiful shots of birds, trees, reptiles, the stark desert, the sunrise/sunset, etc. that fills the film with fresh images of mother nature. Walkabout is a beautiful and complex near-masterpiece film from the land of Australia. Just walk into Walkabout and you won't regret it.

    Had the director just told ONE story & stuck with it, & stop preaching & stop pushing unnecessary themes & images that distract, this could have been WONDERFUL. The awful 1970s soundtrack & overt political themes just get tedious. Making something "artistic" out of what really could have been an emotionally satisfying story ruined it. In fact, ALL EMOTION is lacking in this highly emotional set up. So sad. Terrible movie that could/should be remade by a modern storyteller who knows how to tune into a modern audience would be great. Whatever the political agenda, it was lost amidst the attempts to manipulate.

    I first saw WALKABOUT at an impressionable age and it has stayed with me ever since, not least for its haunting scenes of animal killing and desolation in the Australian outback. WALKABOUT, Nicolas Roeg's masterful exploration of Australia and the people who inhabit it, is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. Roeg brings the harshness of the environment to life in a series of devastating shots that reveal the true heart of the country. His is a world of scorched deserts littered with the corpses of hunted creatures and inhabited by only the brave or foolhardy. In many ways, this is a horror film, bookended by gruesome death and yet containing some moments of pure joy within. The plot is simple: a schoolgirl and her younger brother are lost in the Outback and forced to fend for themselves in a hostile environment. Along the way, they meet up with an Aborigine (played by David Gulpilil, giving a truly great performance of real depth) and the rest of the film chronicles their adventures. Roeg uses this as a basis to explore numerous themes, from the plight of the oppressed indigenous peoples to the contrast between civilisation and the wilderness (to give you a clue, one is utterly condemned and the other fully embraced). Agutter plays a prim and proper, slightly irritating character but Lucien John is excellent as the boy and as previously mentioned, Gulpilil steals every scene he's in. WALKABOUT is one of my favourite films and a real visual experience that transcends cinematic boundaries to become a work of pure art.

    English cinematographer and director Nicolas Roeg's second feature film which was written by English theatre director, poet, theorist, playwright and screenwriter Edward Bond, is loosely based on English author David Gordon Payne alias James Vance Marshall's book from 1959 and premiered In Competition at the 24th Cannes International Film festival in 1971. It was shot entirely on location in Sydney, Australia and is a UK production which was produced by Si Litvinoff. It tells the story about a father who one day goes on a picnic in the Australian wilderness with his two adolescent children. What the children thinks is going be a nice picnic, suddenly turns into a battle for survival when their father pulls out a gun and starts shooting at them. The schoolgirl grabs a hold of her younger brother and manages to hide them behind a rock, but after hearing that her father's car explodes and seeing that he shoots himself, she realizes that they are left to themselves. Intending to get back to Adelaide where they live, the two of them begins to walk into the wilderness and gets lost. The siblings are surrounded by crawling animals, worn-out by the heat and are becoming dehydrated, but suddenly they notice an aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout coming towards them. Acutely and engagingly directed by British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg in the first film he directed on his own, this surreal and ethereal fictional tale draws an exceedingly mysterious portrayal of an abandoned brother and sister's eventful journey of discovery through the Australian wilderness and their encounter with a young aboriginal man. While notable for it's distinct and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Nicolas Roeg, fine editing by British film editor Antony Gibbs and use of sound, this character-driven and finely tuned adventure drama which was executively produced by American producer Max L. Raab (1925-2008) examines themes like coming-of-age, human relations and cultural differences and contains a great score by English composer John Barry (1933-2011). This sparse study of character which is set against the backdrop of the Australian outback and where two siblings are looking for a way to get back to their home, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent and fragmented narrative structure, substantial character development, minimal dialog and the unconventional acting performances by English television and film actress Jenny Agutter, producer and Nicolas Roeg's son Luc Roeg in his debut feature film role and Indigenous Australian actor and traditional dancer David Gulpilil in his debut feature film role. A poignantly atmospheric, memorable and esoteric independent film from the early period of the Australian New Wave in the early 1970s.

    Walkabout is an unusual film; there are few characters and we never learn the names of those. Set in Australia a father drives into the outback with his teenaged daughter and young son; as the boy plays and the girl prepares a picnic the man starts shooting at them. The girl grabs her brother and they take cover; unable to kill his children the man sets fire to his car before shooting himself. This leaves the two children lost deep in the outback with no idea where the nearest town is or even where there is a road. They head off together heading for high ground hoping that they might see a sign of civilisation. They can't see anything so set off again and eventually find an isolated fruit tree next to a small waterhole. They eat and drink before going to sleep; by the time they awaken the water has dried up and the birds have stripped the fruit. It looks as if they will die here until an aboriginal boy finds them. He doesn't speak a word of English and they don't speak his language but he lets them tag along with him and shares the food he finds with them. Ultimately they find a farm but it has long since been abandoned; it is however near a road and that will inevitably lead the two siblings back to civilisation whatever that is. This is one of those films that viewers are likely to declare a masterpiece or terrible; I'm inclined to the former view. There is something strange about it; director Nicolas Roeg has filmed it in a way that makes the landscape both beautiful and ugly at the same time; the camera often cuts away to show wildlife; sometimes alive other times dead and decaying. The landscape they walk through often feels so dry one gets thirsty just looking at it. When they meet the young aborigine his language is left unsubtitled so it is as alien to the viewer as it is to the two siblings. As the three of them travel together the aborigine hunts and kills several animals; we also see a white hunter shooting and cutting open a water buffalo; these scenes might disturb some viewers as they look real. Given the '12' certificate some viewers might be a little surprised to see Jenny Agutter, who was sixteen at the time of filming, totally naked; the scenes are innocent though so shouldn't offend anybody. That isn't to say there is nothing sexual about the film; the way she looked at the Aboriginal boy showed that she was coming to terms with her burgeoning sexuality even if she never acted on those feelings. While not everybody will enjoy this film I think it is one of those that all film fans should watch once; even if you don't enjoy it there are interesting things to be seen.

    I have seen this film dozens of times, more or less since it first appeared on TV in the mid 70s, and each time see more in it - perhaps a reflection that, as I the viewer get older, I understand more of what is being suggested. You start with the nature (an it is glorious), and then the political undercurrent, perhaps the unspoken sexual imagery, the communication failure, the cultural misunderstandings, the wisdom of the white boy (younger and more open to new ideas), and so on. Many other reviewers have commented on the same. One thing that I notice on my latest viewing. Compare the images of the waterhole halfway through, with the images at the end, when The Girl "remembers" them. They are different - very different. The Girl swims alone in the former, but at the end she is with her brother and the aboriginal boy. They communicate and smile with each other - which almost never happens in the main film where The Girl in particular barely attempts to get to know her guide and saviour. And then the quotation. Is the director also saying here that these memories - that maybe all memory - is idealised? That Nostalgia - what we "remember" - is what we want to, even if - in truth - it never happened that way? That The Girl is wanting to return to a past - the Land of Lost Content - that never actually was? As I say, its a beautiful, wonderful film that would be impossible to make today for half a hundred reasons - and a film that can be watched a dozen times, and still appear fresh. Both simple, and complex with layer upon layer. A masterpiece.

Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself.

    English cinematographer and director Nicolas Roeg's second feature film which was written by English theatre director, poet, theorist, playwright and screenwriter Edward Bond, is loosely based on English author David Gordon Payne alias James Vance Marshall's book from 1959 and premiered In Competition at the 24th Cannes International Film festival in 1971. It was shot entirely on location in Sydney, Australia and is a UK production which was produced by Si Litvinoff. It tells the story about a father who one day goes on a picnic in the Australian wilderness with his two adolescent children. What the children thinks is going be a nice picnic, suddenly turns into a battle for survival when their father pulls out a gun and starts shooting at them. The schoolgirl grabs a hold of her younger brother and manages to hide them behind a rock, but after hearing that her father's car explodes and seeing that he shoots himself, she realizes that they are left to themselves. Intending to get back to Adelaide where they live, the two of them begins to walk into the wilderness and gets lost. The siblings are surrounded by crawling animals, worn-out by the heat and are becoming dehydrated, but suddenly they notice an aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout coming towards them. Acutely and engagingly directed by British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg in the first film he directed on his own, this surreal and ethereal fictional tale draws an exceedingly mysterious portrayal of an abandoned brother and sister's eventful journey of discovery through the Australian wilderness and their encounter with a young aboriginal man. While notable for it's distinct and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Nicolas Roeg, fine editing by British film editor Antony Gibbs and use of sound, this character-driven and finely tuned adventure drama which was executively produced by American producer Max L. Raab (1925-2008) examines themes like coming-of-age, human relations and cultural differences and contains a great score by English composer John Barry (1933-2011). This sparse study of character which is set against the backdrop of the Australian outback and where two siblings are looking for a way to get back to their home, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent and fragmented narrative structure, substantial character development, minimal dialog and the unconventional acting performances by English television and film actress Jenny Agutter, producer and Nicolas Roeg's son Luc Roeg in his debut feature film role and Indigenous Australian actor and traditional dancer David Gulpilil in his debut feature film role. A poignantly atmospheric, memorable and esoteric independent film from the early period of the Australian New Wave in the early 1970s.

    Walkabout is an unusual film; there are few characters and we never learn the names of those. Set in Australia a father drives into the outback with his teenaged daughter and young son; as the boy plays and the girl prepares a picnic the man starts shooting at them. The girl grabs her brother and they take cover; unable to kill his children the man sets fire to his car before shooting himself. This leaves the two children lost deep in the outback with no idea where the nearest town is or even where there is a road. They head off together heading for high ground hoping that they might see a sign of civilisation. They can't see anything so set off again and eventually find an isolated fruit tree next to a small waterhole. They eat and drink before going to sleep; by the time they awaken the water has dried up and the birds have stripped the fruit. It looks as if they will die here until an aboriginal boy finds them. He doesn't speak a word of English and they don't speak his language but he lets them tag along with him and shares the food he finds with them. Ultimately they find a farm but it has long since been abandoned; it is however near a road and that will inevitably lead the two siblings back to civilisation whatever that is. This is one of those films that viewers are likely to declare a masterpiece or terrible; I'm inclined to the former view. There is something strange about it; director Nicolas Roeg has filmed it in a way that makes the landscape both beautiful and ugly at the same time; the camera often cuts away to show wildlife; sometimes alive other times dead and decaying. The landscape they walk through often feels so dry one gets thirsty just looking at it. When they meet the young aborigine his language is left unsubtitled so it is as alien to the viewer as it is to the two siblings. As the three of them travel together the aborigine hunts and kills several animals; we also see a white hunter shooting and cutting open a water buffalo; these scenes might disturb some viewers as they look real. Given the '12' certificate some viewers might be a little surprised to see Jenny Agutter, who was sixteen at the time of filming, totally naked; the scenes are innocent though so shouldn't offend anybody. That isn't to say there is nothing sexual about the film; the way she looked at the Aboriginal boy showed that she was coming to terms with her burgeoning sexuality even if she never acted on those feelings. While not everybody will enjoy this film I think it is one of those that all film fans should watch once; even if you don't enjoy it there are interesting things to be seen.

    I have seen this film dozens of times, more or less since it first appeared on TV in the mid 70s, and each time see more in it - perhaps a reflection that, as I the viewer get older, I understand more of what is being suggested. You start with the nature (an it is glorious), and then the political undercurrent, perhaps the unspoken sexual imagery, the communication failure, the cultural misunderstandings, the wisdom of the white boy (younger and more open to new ideas), and so on. Many other reviewers have commented on the same. One thing that I notice on my latest viewing. Compare the images of the waterhole halfway through, with the images at the end, when The Girl "remembers" them. They are different - very different. The Girl swims alone in the former, but at the end she is with her brother and the aboriginal boy. They communicate and smile with each other - which almost never happens in the main film where The Girl in particular barely attempts to get to know her guide and saviour. And then the quotation. Is the director also saying here that these memories - that maybe all memory - is idealised? That Nostalgia - what we "remember" - is what we want to, even if - in truth - it never happened that way? That The Girl is wanting to return to a past - the Land of Lost Content - that never actually was? As I say, its a beautiful, wonderful film that would be impossible to make today for half a hundred reasons - and a film that can be watched a dozen times, and still appear fresh. Both simple, and complex with layer upon layer. A masterpiece.
