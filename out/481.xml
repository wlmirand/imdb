 <sinopse>
  A man tries to rise in his company by letting its executives use his apartment for trysts, but complications and a romance of his own ensue.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  As of November 1, 1959, mild mannered C.C. Baxter has been working at Consolidated Life, an insurance company, for close to four years, and is one of close to thirty-two thousand employees located in their Manhattan head office. To distinguish himself from all the other lowly cogs in the company in the hopes of moving up the corporate ladder, he often works late, but only because he can't get into his apartment, located off of Central Park West, since he has provided it to a handful of company executives - Mssrs. Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger - on a rotating basis for their extramarital liaisons in return for a good word to the personnel director, Jeff D. Sheldrake. When Baxter is called into Sheldrake's office for the first time, he learns that it isn't just to be promoted as he expects, but also to add married Sheldrake to the list to who he will lend his apartment. What Baxter is unaware of is that Sheldrake's mistress is Fran Kubelik, an elevator girl in the ...

    Billy Wilder is one of the most highly regarded directors of his generation and The Apartment is one of his most acclaimed films. The Apartment is a funny and dramatic, aimed with a script that is witty and tragic. Both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have great chemistry and give great performances, Lemmon giving a nervous energy to his character, a little like Woody Allen but much less self-obsessed whilst MacLaine has plenty of charm and wit, but also has tragedy about her. The comedy is gentle amidst the controversial material for the time, filled with witty lines, character interactions and subtle sight gags. We get plenty of melodrama and the characters go through typical arcs, but the screenplay is so well written and the direction and acting that it makes The Apartment a rewarding experience, even during its darkest moments.

    The Apartment starts off in a very catchy way by an original, dynamic, finely directed plot that arouses curiosity and impatience as to the following developments. Unfortunately, the movie turns, after an hour, into a behind closed doors love story, where the rhythm drops significantly simultaneously with the interest for this conventional and schmaltzy romance. The film then struggles to find a second wind and this second part turns out to be very long, so much so that the viewer is almost relieved when it comes to an end. It's a bit of a shame because, besides the cast and direction both accurate, the script suggests a cynical critic of the unmerciful world of business, the race for profit and individual success, foreshadowing, relatively speaking, other works on the dehumanization of work such as Brazil  think of the shot of the lined up desks.

    "The Apartment" is perhaps the greatest achievement in Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder's highlight-filled careers. Many critics find its story gentler than some of Wilder's other films such as "Ace in the Hole" and "Double Indemnity," but I don't detect any artistic compromise. Wilder creates a believable, full-fledged love story that exists alongside the familiar dark humor, snappy dialogue, and depictions of immoral behavior that characterize most of his movies. Rather than diluting these essential Wilderian elements, the addition of a likable everyman--whom Jack Lemmon plays with perfection--throws them into sharper relief through contrast.

    This absolute delight from 1960 is one of Billy Wilder's best works. His Direction of the always wonderful Jack Lemmon and stunning beauty Shirley MacLaine is up there with the best of his generation. The audience can't help but be sympathetic to Lemmon's character, and root for requited love of MacLaines character. Lemmon should have won the Best Actor nod. The mixture of comedy and drama is very appealing to mass audiences, and I feel this picture will be a new favorite for fans of Lemmon or Wilder who may not be familiar with their always genius collaborations. Take some time to check it out!

    The Apartment is a story that sparkles with a scintillating script, humour, and interesting characters as employees of a large insurance company come into conflict with each other. The story set in mid-20th century Manhattan is considered a "classic". The acting, the mix of characters and script are outstanding. New York City, 1959 is written all over it. The bar scenes, the office Christmas party, the walk-up apartment on the Upper West Side, the White Plains home of one of the executives all evoke the era. Jack Lemmon is C.C. Baxter a young employee trying to climb the greasy pole of success in a huge Manhattan insurance company. Shirley MacLaine is Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the company's office skyscraper, who falls in love with one of the higher-ups, and Fred McMurray is Jeff Sheldrake, director of personnel. All deliver great performances with a strong supporting cast. The movie presents the characters, particularly Kubelik and Baxter,in ethical dilemmas and as the movie goes along, we see these two come to grips with how they are living out their lives. A great movie by director Billy Wilder, who created some heavyweight movies like Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Some Like It Hot, and Sunset Boulevard. The movie held my interest from scene to scene. It is superbly acted, and very funny.

    The simplicity of storytelling is what's missing in most romantic comedies these days, especially the x dozens of repetitively formulaic over-commercialized New York centered films. Even though it touches on themes like labour exploitation, sex and infidelity there's a certain innocence and purity in 'The Apartment' which is evident in most Billy Wilder films. This is a key ingredient missing in most of the recent Hollywood films of that genre. Like most of Wilder's classics, the dialogues are smooth, witty, simplistic and funny. There's hardly any overly melodramatic moment here. Plus, who better than Lemmon to play the common man and Maclaine to play the smart, classy yet vulnerable lass. Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine were a very successful pair on screen. 'The Apartment' is one of theirs and Billy Wilder's finest films. Romance at its best.

    Billy Wilder is a really swell guy. He takes serious matter and makes it entertaining: Sunset Blvd. blew me away, and now The Apartment has put a big smile on my face. Wilder injects this uppity- atmosphere into almost every scene and it makes the film a pleasure to watch, no matter how serious the plot gets. And behind the charm of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, there is a serious plot. The Apartment is about Baxter, a New York business cog, trying to move up in his company not through hard work, or extra socializing, or self- pitching, but by lending his apartment to his coworkers' extra-martial affairs. Being a 60's film, this cannot be said directly, but the hinting is so strong you pick up instantly. The film is quite liberal, content-wise. The film shows that blackmail goes both ways: Baxter may believe he has the upper hand, with his clients on a string... but he does not, and he sinks deeper into his lie. Of course it comes across humorously, with his neighbours scolding him for his 'sexpot' antics, though the good doctor would also like if his body could be donated to science. Baxter is quite a character, an innocent everyman with his own set of faults and quirks. Lemmon is magnetic: we always root for Lemmon, even as he tells pitiful lies to his landlady and can't stand up to his clients. Even his borderline creepy knowledge of Ms. Kubelik comes off as just charm. An immensely likable character. The object of his affection, Fran Kubelik, is also quite a charmer. Her problem is men, but she knows it. She doesn't fake innocence. We have all known that flirty girl who ends up on your nerves... but Fran isn't that girl. Wilder knows just how to handle his characters. Now, more than 50 years after its release, trying to look at The Apartment academically is strange, because its era has passed. Things like that don't happen any more. Right? Perhaps not as specifically, but the cost of power is a universal theme. What do you sacrifice to try and get ahead? Property, dignity, even your love? C.C. Baxter knows how much he'll give, but also what he won't. The film ends positively, which is nice, and deserving, especially after seeing Sunset Blvd. The Apartment is wonderful, sharply written and performed, and makes a great evening. 8.9/10

    I'm not one of those people who demands that all movies adhere to some sort of realism, especially comedies, or that all characters behave as people do in the real world. But I do expect a movie to give me at least one character who isn't a complete jerk, or a complete moron, or both. Alas, "The Apartment" offers plenty of morons, many of whom are also jerks. Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, may be the biggest moron in the film. He is a bit of a jerk as well, in that his motives consist primarily of career advancement. His doctor neighbor tells him as much (even if his impression of Baxter is distorted, which Baxter does nothing to correct). Baxter's superiors at the company are likewise flawed; they are using him to gain access to his apartment, as if there aren't other arrangements they could make in the entire borough of Manhattan. Of course the humble elevator girl, Fran, is the smartest of the bunch. But she isn't the brightest bulb on the circuit either. The weakest section of the film concerns her suicide attempt, enabled by a bottle of Seconal which is inexplicably left lying around the bathroom. Suddenly a light romantic comedy is thrust into noirish bathos, from which it never really emerges until the final scene. I've never been a fan of Lemmon's, and this film is a great example why. His acting style is so broad, so cloying, that it's impossible to take him seriously later on when he finally stands up to his boss over rights to the apartment. Shirley MacLaine, on the other hand, is outstanding. Just 25 when shooting started, she is acting rings around the rest of the cast. Too bad the Beattys didn't have more children -- acting clearly runs in the family. "The Apartment" tries to be two movies -- rom com and noir -- and in the end succeeds at neither. Billy Wilder, a very fine director, would've done better sticking to one genre and developing the characters (maybe dumping a few extraneous ones in the process).

    A timeless classic in director Billy Wilder's typical anti-establishment satirical style, this is one of Jack Lemmon's best imho. He plays the protagonist CC Baxter, working in a large insurance firm in New York City, just one of many faces in a sea of desks and office machines on a floor of the building. Though he is surrounded by a multitude of people in and out of the office, he is alone socially, having no visible family nor close friends. The main diversion (if it can be called that) he has is lending out his bachelor style apartment to the middle-ranking executives of the insurance firm for their extra-marital trysts, in return they promise him that they will put in a good word with the higher management for him to get promoted to a better position. This he complies with, even if it puts him at such as a disadvantage as having to stand outdoors in freezing weather while waiting for the current occupant to vacate the apartment. In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right. The supposedly funny scenes are not the sort that you would want to guffaw at, maybe just a snicker or two, but on the whole it does have its light moments, mostly based on misunderstanding and misinterpretation of situations, like Baxter's doctor neighbor assuming that he (Baxter) is a womanizing playboy causing a lot of ruckus most nights in his apartment when actually it's the doing of others. The fact that he leaves a wastebasket full of empty alcohol bottles (courtesy of the executive's liaisons) outside his door doesn't help improve his standing in the doc's eyes either. If by definition of romance, one would expect hot steamy kissing and bed scenes, then prepare for disappointment, as this movie contains none of that. Baxter does eventually fall for pretty elevator operator Fran Kubelik (played so expertly by Shirley McLaine), but does so in a modulated, hesitant way, and only because circumstances begin to arise such that she ends up in his apartment (after being left behind by her lover Sheldrake), and he's left to pick up the pieces of her failed romance literally, just like he's left to collect the litter left behind in his apartment by his higher up bosses after their dalliances. Fred McMurray is memorable as the sleazy despicable Personnel Director Jeff Sheldrake, a role as far from what we expect from McMurray, who usually plays nice guy in previous movies. He is deliciously detestable in playing on the emotions of Kubelik, making her think that he truly loves her and will divorce his present wife to marry her. The other characters - the middle ranking managers, the office workers, etc serve merely as cogs to fill in the completeness of the wheel to get the story going. All in all this is a very watchable film, and one deserving to rank as one of the classics in film history.

    ... as for films by Wilder, I like e.g. Some Like It Hot much more. Lemmon and McLaine are brilliant, of course, but there is not so much comedy within, you feel often sadness and compassion. Black-and-white background does not provide something extra, on the contrary - and it is still 1960 when several color films had already been made. Generally the idea of the script is nice, providing an opportunity to create a lot of crazy confusions and puttering around. Wilder has grabbed this opportunity in full, being undoubtedly a great director and producer. But somehow I feel that The Apartment would not have received so many Academy Awards decades later, it has become timeworn.

In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right. The supposedly funny scenes are not the sort that you would want to guffaw at, maybe just a snicker or two, but on the whole it does have its light moments, mostly based on misunderstanding and misinterpretation of situations, like Baxter's doctor neighbor assuming that he (Baxter) is a womanizing playboy causing a lot of ruckus most nights in his apartment when actually it's the doing of others. The fact that he leaves a wastebasket full of empty alcohol bottles (courtesy of the executive's liaisons) outside his door doesn't help improve his standing in the doc's eyes either. If by definition of romance, one would expect hot steamy kissing and bed scenes, then prepare for disappointment, as this movie contains none of that. Baxter does eventually fall for pretty elevator operator Fran Kubelik (played so expertly by Shirley McLaine), but does so in a modulated, hesitant way, and only because circumstances begin to arise such that she ends up in his apartment (after being left behind by her lover Sheldrake), and he's left to pick up the pieces of her failed romance literally, just like he's left to collect the litter left behind in his apartment by his higher up bosses after their dalliances. Fred McMurray is memorable as the sleazy despicable Personnel Director Jeff Sheldrake, a role as far from what we expect from McMurray, who usually plays nice guy in previous movies. He is deliciously detestable in playing on the emotions of Kubelik, making her think that he truly loves her and will divorce his present wife to marry her. The other characters - the middle ranking managers, the office workers, etc serve merely as cogs to fill in the completeness of the wheel to get the story going. All in all this is a very watchable film, and one deserving to rank as one of the classics in film history.

    ... as for films by Wilder, I like e.g. Some Like It Hot much more. Lemmon and McLaine are brilliant, of course, but there is not so much comedy within, you feel often sadness and compassion. Black-and-white background does not provide something extra, on the contrary - and it is still 1960 when several color films had already been made. Generally the idea of the script is nice, providing an opportunity to create a lot of crazy confusions and puttering around. Wilder has grabbed this opportunity in full, being undoubtedly a great director and producer. But somehow I feel that The Apartment would not have received so many Academy Awards decades later, it has become timeworn.

    Billy Wilder is one of the most highly regarded directors of his generation and The Apartment is one of his most acclaimed films. The Apartment is a funny and dramatic, aimed with a script that is witty and tragic. Both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have great chemistry and give great performances, Lemmon giving a nervous energy to his character, a little like Woody Allen but much less self-obsessed whilst MacLaine has plenty of charm and wit, but also has tragedy about her. The comedy is gentle amidst the controversial material for the time, filled with witty lines, character interactions and subtle sight gags. We get plenty of melodrama and the characters go through typical arcs, but the screenplay is so well written and the direction and acting that it makes The Apartment a rewarding experience, even during its darkest moments.

    The Apartment starts off in a very catchy way by an original, dynamic, finely directed plot that arouses curiosity and impatience as to the following developments. Unfortunately, the movie turns, after an hour, into a behind closed doors love story, where the rhythm drops significantly simultaneously with the interest for this conventional and schmaltzy romance. The film then struggles to find a second wind and this second part turns out to be very long, so much so that the viewer is almost relieved when it comes to an end. It's a bit of a shame because, besides the cast and direction both accurate, the script suggests a cynical critic of the unmerciful world of business, the race for profit and individual success, foreshadowing, relatively speaking, other works on the dehumanization of work such as Brazil  think of the shot of the lined up desks.

    "The Apartment" is perhaps the greatest achievement in Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder's highlight-filled careers. Many critics find its story gentler than some of Wilder's other films such as "Ace in the Hole" and "Double Indemnity," but I don't detect any artistic compromise. Wilder creates a believable, full-fledged love story that exists alongside the familiar dark humor, snappy dialogue, and depictions of immoral behavior that characterize most of his movies. Rather than diluting these essential Wilderian elements, the addition of a likable everyman--whom Jack Lemmon plays with perfection--throws them into sharper relief through contrast.

    This absolute delight from 1960 is one of Billy Wilder's best works. His Direction of the always wonderful Jack Lemmon and stunning beauty Shirley MacLaine is up there with the best of his generation. The audience can't help but be sympathetic to Lemmon's character, and root for requited love of MacLaines character. Lemmon should have won the Best Actor nod. The mixture of comedy and drama is very appealing to mass audiences, and I feel this picture will be a new favorite for fans of Lemmon or Wilder who may not be familiar with their always genius collaborations. Take some time to check it out!

    The Apartment is a story that sparkles with a scintillating script, humour, and interesting characters as employees of a large insurance company come into conflict with each other. The story set in mid-20th century Manhattan is considered a "classic". The acting, the mix of characters and script are outstanding. New York City, 1959 is written all over it. The bar scenes, the office Christmas party, the walk-up apartment on the Upper West Side, the White Plains home of one of the executives all evoke the era. Jack Lemmon is C.C. Baxter a young employee trying to climb the greasy pole of success in a huge Manhattan insurance company. Shirley MacLaine is Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the company's office skyscraper, who falls in love with one of the higher-ups, and Fred McMurray is Jeff Sheldrake, director of personnel. All deliver great performances with a strong supporting cast. The movie presents the characters, particularly Kubelik and Baxter,in ethical dilemmas and as the movie goes along, we see these two come to grips with how they are living out their lives. A great movie by director Billy Wilder, who created some heavyweight movies like Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Some Like It Hot, and Sunset Boulevard. The movie held my interest from scene to scene. It is superbly acted, and very funny.

    The simplicity of storytelling is what's missing in most romantic comedies these days, especially the x dozens of repetitively formulaic over-commercialized New York centered films. Even though it touches on themes like labour exploitation, sex and infidelity there's a certain innocence and purity in 'The Apartment' which is evident in most Billy Wilder films. This is a key ingredient missing in most of the recent Hollywood films of that genre. Like most of Wilder's classics, the dialogues are smooth, witty, simplistic and funny. There's hardly any overly melodramatic moment here. Plus, who better than Lemmon to play the common man and Maclaine to play the smart, classy yet vulnerable lass. Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine were a very successful pair on screen. 'The Apartment' is one of theirs and Billy Wilder's finest films. Romance at its best.

    Billy Wilder is a really swell guy. He takes serious matter and makes it entertaining: Sunset Blvd. blew me away, and now The Apartment has put a big smile on my face. Wilder injects this uppity- atmosphere into almost every scene and it makes the film a pleasure to watch, no matter how serious the plot gets. And behind the charm of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, there is a serious plot. The Apartment is about Baxter, a New York business cog, trying to move up in his company not through hard work, or extra socializing, or self- pitching, but by lending his apartment to his coworkers' extra-martial affairs. Being a 60's film, this cannot be said directly, but the hinting is so strong you pick up instantly. The film is quite liberal, content-wise. The film shows that blackmail goes both ways: Baxter may believe he has the upper hand, with his clients on a string... but he does not, and he sinks deeper into his lie. Of course it comes across humorously, with his neighbours scolding him for his 'sexpot' antics, though the good doctor would also like if his body could be donated to science. Baxter is quite a character, an innocent everyman with his own set of faults and quirks. Lemmon is magnetic: we always root for Lemmon, even as he tells pitiful lies to his landlady and can't stand up to his clients. Even his borderline creepy knowledge of Ms. Kubelik comes off as just charm. An immensely likable character. The object of his affection, Fran Kubelik, is also quite a charmer. Her problem is men, but she knows it. She doesn't fake innocence. We have all known that flirty girl who ends up on your nerves... but Fran isn't that girl. Wilder knows just how to handle his characters. Now, more than 50 years after its release, trying to look at The Apartment academically is strange, because its era has passed. Things like that don't happen any more. Right? Perhaps not as specifically, but the cost of power is a universal theme. What do you sacrifice to try and get ahead? Property, dignity, even your love? C.C. Baxter knows how much he'll give, but also what he won't. The film ends positively, which is nice, and deserving, especially after seeing Sunset Blvd. The Apartment is wonderful, sharply written and performed, and makes a great evening. 8.9/10

    I'm not one of those people who demands that all movies adhere to some sort of realism, especially comedies, or that all characters behave as people do in the real world. But I do expect a movie to give me at least one character who isn't a complete jerk, or a complete moron, or both. Alas, "The Apartment" offers plenty of morons, many of whom are also jerks. Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, may be the biggest moron in the film. He is a bit of a jerk as well, in that his motives consist primarily of career advancement. His doctor neighbor tells him as much (even if his impression of Baxter is distorted, which Baxter does nothing to correct). Baxter's superiors at the company are likewise flawed; they are using him to gain access to his apartment, as if there aren't other arrangements they could make in the entire borough of Manhattan. Of course the humble elevator girl, Fran, is the smartest of the bunch. But she isn't the brightest bulb on the circuit either. The weakest section of the film concerns her suicide attempt, enabled by a bottle of Seconal which is inexplicably left lying around the bathroom. Suddenly a light romantic comedy is thrust into noirish bathos, from which it never really emerges until the final scene. I've never been a fan of Lemmon's, and this film is a great example why. His acting style is so broad, so cloying, that it's impossible to take him seriously later on when he finally stands up to his boss over rights to the apartment. Shirley MacLaine, on the other hand, is outstanding. Just 25 when shooting started, she is acting rings around the rest of the cast. Too bad the Beattys didn't have more children -- acting clearly runs in the family. "The Apartment" tries to be two movies -- rom com and noir -- and in the end succeeds at neither. Billy Wilder, a very fine director, would've done better sticking to one genre and developing the characters (maybe dumping a few extraneous ones in the process).

    A timeless classic in director Billy Wilder's typical anti-establishment satirical style, this is one of Jack Lemmon's best imho. He plays the protagonist CC Baxter, working in a large insurance firm in New York City, just one of many faces in a sea of desks and office machines on a floor of the building. Though he is surrounded by a multitude of people in and out of the office, he is alone socially, having no visible family nor close friends. The main diversion (if it can be called that) he has is lending out his bachelor style apartment to the middle-ranking executives of the insurance firm for their extra-marital trysts, in return they promise him that they will put in a good word with the higher management for him to get promoted to a better position. This he complies with, even if it puts him at such as a disadvantage as having to stand outdoors in freezing weather while waiting for the current occupant to vacate the apartment. In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right.

He plays the protagonist CC Baxter, working in a large insurance firm in New York City, just one of many faces in a sea of desks and office machines on a floor of the building. Though he is surrounded by a multitude of people in and out of the office, he is alone socially, having no visible family nor close friends. The main diversion (if it can be called that) he has is lending out his bachelor style apartment to the middle-ranking executives of the insurance firm for their extra-marital trysts, in return they promise him that they will put in a good word with the higher management for him to get promoted to a better position. This he complies with, even if it puts him at such as a disadvantage as having to stand outdoors in freezing weather while waiting for the current occupant to vacate the apartment. In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right. The supposedly funny scenes are not the sort that you would want to guffaw at, maybe just a snicker or two, but on the whole it does have its light moments, mostly based on misunderstanding and misinterpretation of situations, like Baxter's doctor neighbor assuming that he (Baxter) is a womanizing playboy causing a lot of ruckus most nights in his apartment when actually it's the doing of others. The fact that he leaves a wastebasket full of empty alcohol bottles (courtesy of the executive's liaisons) outside his door doesn't help improve his standing in the doc's eyes either. If by definition of romance, one would expect hot steamy kissing and bed scenes, then prepare for disappointment, as this movie contains none of that. Baxter does eventually fall for pretty elevator operator Fran Kubelik (played so expertly by Shirley McLaine), but does so in a modulated, hesitant way, and only because circumstances begin to arise such that she ends up in his apartment (after being left behind by her lover Sheldrake), and he's left to pick up the pieces of her failed romance literally, just like he's left to collect the litter left behind in his apartment by his higher up bosses after their dalliances. Fred McMurray is memorable as the sleazy despicable Personnel Director Jeff Sheldrake, a role as far from what we expect from McMurray, who usually plays nice guy in previous movies. He is deliciously detestable in playing on the emotions of Kubelik, making her think that he truly loves her and will divorce his present wife to marry her. The other characters - the middle ranking managers, the office workers, etc serve merely as cogs to fill in the completeness of the wheel to get the story going. All in all this is a very watchable film, and one deserving to rank as one of the classics in film history.

    ... as for films by Wilder, I like e.g. Some Like It Hot much more. Lemmon and McLaine are brilliant, of course, but there is not so much comedy within, you feel often sadness and compassion. Black-and-white background does not provide something extra, on the contrary - and it is still 1960 when several color films had already been made. Generally the idea of the script is nice, providing an opportunity to create a lot of crazy confusions and puttering around. Wilder has grabbed this opportunity in full, being undoubtedly a great director and producer. But somehow I feel that The Apartment would not have received so many Academy Awards decades later, it has become timeworn.

    Billy Wilder is one of the most highly regarded directors of his generation and The Apartment is one of his most acclaimed films. The Apartment is a funny and dramatic, aimed with a script that is witty and tragic. Both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have great chemistry and give great performances, Lemmon giving a nervous energy to his character, a little like Woody Allen but much less self-obsessed whilst MacLaine has plenty of charm and wit, but also has tragedy about her. The comedy is gentle amidst the controversial material for the time, filled with witty lines, character interactions and subtle sight gags. We get plenty of melodrama and the characters go through typical arcs, but the screenplay is so well written and the direction and acting that it makes The Apartment a rewarding experience, even during its darkest moments.

    The Apartment starts off in a very catchy way by an original, dynamic, finely directed plot that arouses curiosity and impatience as to the following developments. Unfortunately, the movie turns, after an hour, into a behind closed doors love story, where the rhythm drops significantly simultaneously with the interest for this conventional and schmaltzy romance. The film then struggles to find a second wind and this second part turns out to be very long, so much so that the viewer is almost relieved when it comes to an end. It's a bit of a shame because, besides the cast and direction both accurate, the script suggests a cynical critic of the unmerciful world of business, the race for profit and individual success, foreshadowing, relatively speaking, other works on the dehumanization of work such as Brazil  think of the shot of the lined up desks.

    "The Apartment" is perhaps the greatest achievement in Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder's highlight-filled careers. Many critics find its story gentler than some of Wilder's other films such as "Ace in the Hole" and "Double Indemnity," but I don't detect any artistic compromise. Wilder creates a believable, full-fledged love story that exists alongside the familiar dark humor, snappy dialogue, and depictions of immoral behavior that characterize most of his movies. Rather than diluting these essential Wilderian elements, the addition of a likable everyman--whom Jack Lemmon plays with perfection--throws them into sharper relief through contrast.

    This absolute delight from 1960 is one of Billy Wilder's best works. His Direction of the always wonderful Jack Lemmon and stunning beauty Shirley MacLaine is up there with the best of his generation. The audience can't help but be sympathetic to Lemmon's character, and root for requited love of MacLaines character. Lemmon should have won the Best Actor nod. The mixture of comedy and drama is very appealing to mass audiences, and I feel this picture will be a new favorite for fans of Lemmon or Wilder who may not be familiar with their always genius collaborations. Take some time to check it out!

    The Apartment is a story that sparkles with a scintillating script, humour, and interesting characters as employees of a large insurance company come into conflict with each other. The story set in mid-20th century Manhattan is considered a "classic". The acting, the mix of characters and script are outstanding. New York City, 1959 is written all over it. The bar scenes, the office Christmas party, the walk-up apartment on the Upper West Side, the White Plains home of one of the executives all evoke the era. Jack Lemmon is C.C. Baxter a young employee trying to climb the greasy pole of success in a huge Manhattan insurance company. Shirley MacLaine is Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the company's office skyscraper, who falls in love with one of the higher-ups, and Fred McMurray is Jeff Sheldrake, director of personnel. All deliver great performances with a strong supporting cast. The movie presents the characters, particularly Kubelik and Baxter,in ethical dilemmas and as the movie goes along, we see these two come to grips with how they are living out their lives. A great movie by director Billy Wilder, who created some heavyweight movies like Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Some Like It Hot, and Sunset Boulevard. The movie held my interest from scene to scene. It is superbly acted, and very funny.

    The simplicity of storytelling is what's missing in most romantic comedies these days, especially the x dozens of repetitively formulaic over-commercialized New York centered films. Even though it touches on themes like labour exploitation, sex and infidelity there's a certain innocence and purity in 'The Apartment' which is evident in most Billy Wilder films. This is a key ingredient missing in most of the recent Hollywood films of that genre. Like most of Wilder's classics, the dialogues are smooth, witty, simplistic and funny. There's hardly any overly melodramatic moment here. Plus, who better than Lemmon to play the common man and Maclaine to play the smart, classy yet vulnerable lass. Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine were a very successful pair on screen. 'The Apartment' is one of theirs and Billy Wilder's finest films. Romance at its best.

    Billy Wilder is a really swell guy. He takes serious matter and makes it entertaining: Sunset Blvd. blew me away, and now The Apartment has put a big smile on my face. Wilder injects this uppity- atmosphere into almost every scene and it makes the film a pleasure to watch, no matter how serious the plot gets. And behind the charm of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, there is a serious plot. The Apartment is about Baxter, a New York business cog, trying to move up in his company not through hard work, or extra socializing, or self- pitching, but by lending his apartment to his coworkers' extra-martial affairs. Being a 60's film, this cannot be said directly, but the hinting is so strong you pick up instantly. The film is quite liberal, content-wise. The film shows that blackmail goes both ways: Baxter may believe he has the upper hand, with his clients on a string... but he does not, and he sinks deeper into his lie. Of course it comes across humorously, with his neighbours scolding him for his 'sexpot' antics, though the good doctor would also like if his body could be donated to science. Baxter is quite a character, an innocent everyman with his own set of faults and quirks. Lemmon is magnetic: we always root for Lemmon, even as he tells pitiful lies to his landlady and can't stand up to his clients. Even his borderline creepy knowledge of Ms. Kubelik comes off as just charm. An immensely likable character. The object of his affection, Fran Kubelik, is also quite a charmer. Her problem is men, but she knows it. She doesn't fake innocence. We have all known that flirty girl who ends up on your nerves... but Fran isn't that girl. Wilder knows just how to handle his characters. Now, more than 50 years after its release, trying to look at The Apartment academically is strange, because its era has passed. Things like that don't happen any more. Right? Perhaps not as specifically, but the cost of power is a universal theme. What do you sacrifice to try and get ahead? Property, dignity, even your love? C.C. Baxter knows how much he'll give, but also what he won't. The film ends positively, which is nice, and deserving, especially after seeing Sunset Blvd. The Apartment is wonderful, sharply written and performed, and makes a great evening. 8.9/10

    I'm not one of those people who demands that all movies adhere to some sort of realism, especially comedies, or that all characters behave as people do in the real world. But I do expect a movie to give me at least one character who isn't a complete jerk, or a complete moron, or both. Alas, "The Apartment" offers plenty of morons, many of whom are also jerks. Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, may be the biggest moron in the film. He is a bit of a jerk as well, in that his motives consist primarily of career advancement. His doctor neighbor tells him as much (even if his impression of Baxter is distorted, which Baxter does nothing to correct). Baxter's superiors at the company are likewise flawed; they are using him to gain access to his apartment, as if there aren't other arrangements they could make in the entire borough of Manhattan. Of course the humble elevator girl, Fran, is the smartest of the bunch. But she isn't the brightest bulb on the circuit either. The weakest section of the film concerns her suicide attempt, enabled by a bottle of Seconal which is inexplicably left lying around the bathroom. Suddenly a light romantic comedy is thrust into noirish bathos, from which it never really emerges until the final scene. I've never been a fan of Lemmon's, and this film is a great example why. His acting style is so broad, so cloying, that it's impossible to take him seriously later on when he finally stands up to his boss over rights to the apartment. Shirley MacLaine, on the other hand, is outstanding. Just 25 when shooting started, she is acting rings around the rest of the cast. Too bad the Beattys didn't have more children -- acting clearly runs in the family. "The Apartment" tries to be two movies -- rom com and noir -- and in the end succeeds at neither. Billy Wilder, a very fine director, would've done better sticking to one genre and developing the characters (maybe dumping a few extraneous ones in the process).

    A timeless classic in director Billy Wilder's typical anti-establishment satirical style, this is one of Jack Lemmon's best imho. He plays the protagonist CC Baxter, working in a large insurance firm in New York City, just one of many faces in a sea of desks and office machines on a floor of the building. Though he is surrounded by a multitude of people in and out of the office, he is alone socially, having no visible family nor close friends. The main diversion (if it can be called that) he has is lending out his bachelor style apartment to the middle-ranking executives of the insurance firm for their extra-marital trysts, in return they promise him that they will put in a good word with the higher management for him to get promoted to a better position. This he complies with, even if it puts him at such as a disadvantage as having to stand outdoors in freezing weather while waiting for the current occupant to vacate the apartment. In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right. The supposedly funny scenes are not the sort that you would want to guffaw at, maybe just a snicker or two, but on the whole it does have its light moments, mostly based on misunderstanding and misinterpretation of situations, like Baxter's doctor neighbor assuming that he (Baxter) is a womanizing playboy causing a lot of ruckus most nights in his apartment when actually it's the doing of others. The fact that he leaves a wastebasket full of empty alcohol bottles (courtesy of the executive's liaisons) outside his door doesn't help improve his standing in the doc's eyes either. If by definition of romance, one would expect hot steamy kissing and bed scenes, then prepare for disappointment, as this movie contains none of that. Baxter does eventually fall for pretty elevator operator Fran Kubelik (played so expertly by Shirley McLaine), but does so in a modulated, hesitant way, and only because circumstances begin to arise such that she ends up in his apartment (after being left behind by her lover Sheldrake), and he's left to pick up the pieces of her failed romance literally, just like he's left to collect the litter left behind in his apartment by his higher up bosses after their dalliances. Fred McMurray is memorable as the sleazy despicable Personnel Director Jeff Sheldrake, a role as far from what we expect from McMurray, who usually plays nice guy in previous movies. He is deliciously detestable in playing on the emotions of Kubelik, making her think that he truly loves her and will divorce his present wife to marry her. The other characters - the middle ranking managers, the office workers, etc serve merely as cogs to fill in the completeness of the wheel to get the story going. All in all this is a very watchable film, and one deserving to rank as one of the classics in film history.

    ... as for films by Wilder, I like e.g. Some Like It Hot much more. Lemmon and McLaine are brilliant, of course, but there is not so much comedy within, you feel often sadness and compassion. Black-and-white background does not provide something extra, on the contrary - and it is still 1960 when several color films had already been made. Generally the idea of the script is nice, providing an opportunity to create a lot of crazy confusions and puttering around. Wilder has grabbed this opportunity in full, being undoubtedly a great director and producer. But somehow I feel that The Apartment would not have received so many Academy Awards decades later, it has become timeworn.

    Billy Wilder is one of the most highly regarded directors of his generation and The Apartment is one of his most acclaimed films. The Apartment is a funny and dramatic, aimed with a script that is witty and tragic. Both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have great chemistry and give great performances, Lemmon giving a nervous energy to his character, a little like Woody Allen but much less self-obsessed whilst MacLaine has plenty of charm and wit, but also has tragedy about her. The comedy is gentle amidst the controversial material for the time, filled with witty lines, character interactions and subtle sight gags. We get plenty of melodrama and the characters go through typical arcs, but the screenplay is so well written and the direction and acting that it makes The Apartment a rewarding experience, even during its darkest moments.

    The Apartment starts off in a very catchy way by an original, dynamic, finely directed plot that arouses curiosity and impatience as to the following developments. Unfortunately, the movie turns, after an hour, into a behind closed doors love story, where the rhythm drops significantly simultaneously with the interest for this conventional and schmaltzy romance. The film then struggles to find a second wind and this second part turns out to be very long, so much so that the viewer is almost relieved when it comes to an end. It's a bit of a shame because, besides the cast and direction both accurate, the script suggests a cynical critic of the unmerciful world of business, the race for profit and individual success, foreshadowing, relatively speaking, other works on the dehumanization of work such as Brazil  think of the shot of the lined up desks.

    "The Apartment" is perhaps the greatest achievement in Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder's highlight-filled careers. Many critics find its story gentler than some of Wilder's other films such as "Ace in the Hole" and "Double Indemnity," but I don't detect any artistic compromise. Wilder creates a believable, full-fledged love story that exists alongside the familiar dark humor, snappy dialogue, and depictions of immoral behavior that characterize most of his movies. Rather than diluting these essential Wilderian elements, the addition of a likable everyman--whom Jack Lemmon plays with perfection--throws them into sharper relief through contrast.

    This absolute delight from 1960 is one of Billy Wilder's best works. His Direction of the always wonderful Jack Lemmon and stunning beauty Shirley MacLaine is up there with the best of his generation. The audience can't help but be sympathetic to Lemmon's character, and root for requited love of MacLaines character. Lemmon should have won the Best Actor nod. The mixture of comedy and drama is very appealing to mass audiences, and I feel this picture will be a new favorite for fans of Lemmon or Wilder who may not be familiar with their always genius collaborations. Take some time to check it out!

    The Apartment is a story that sparkles with a scintillating script, humour, and interesting characters as employees of a large insurance company come into conflict with each other. The story set in mid-20th century Manhattan is considered a "classic". The acting, the mix of characters and script are outstanding. New York City, 1959 is written all over it. The bar scenes, the office Christmas party, the walk-up apartment on the Upper West Side, the White Plains home of one of the executives all evoke the era. Jack Lemmon is C.C. Baxter a young employee trying to climb the greasy pole of success in a huge Manhattan insurance company. Shirley MacLaine is Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the company's office skyscraper, who falls in love with one of the higher-ups, and Fred McMurray is Jeff Sheldrake, director of personnel. All deliver great performances with a strong supporting cast. The movie presents the characters, particularly Kubelik and Baxter,in ethical dilemmas and as the movie goes along, we see these two come to grips with how they are living out their lives. A great movie by director Billy Wilder, who created some heavyweight movies like Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Some Like It Hot, and Sunset Boulevard. The movie held my interest from scene to scene. It is superbly acted, and very funny.

    The simplicity of storytelling is what's missing in most romantic comedies these days, especially the x dozens of repetitively formulaic over-commercialized New York centered films. Even though it touches on themes like labour exploitation, sex and infidelity there's a certain innocence and purity in 'The Apartment' which is evident in most Billy Wilder films. This is a key ingredient missing in most of the recent Hollywood films of that genre. Like most of Wilder's classics, the dialogues are smooth, witty, simplistic and funny. There's hardly any overly melodramatic moment here. Plus, who better than Lemmon to play the common man and Maclaine to play the smart, classy yet vulnerable lass. Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine were a very successful pair on screen. 'The Apartment' is one of theirs and Billy Wilder's finest films. Romance at its best.

    Billy Wilder is a really swell guy. He takes serious matter and makes it entertaining: Sunset Blvd. blew me away, and now The Apartment has put a big smile on my face. Wilder injects this uppity- atmosphere into almost every scene and it makes the film a pleasure to watch, no matter how serious the plot gets. And behind the charm of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, there is a serious plot. The Apartment is about Baxter, a New York business cog, trying to move up in his company not through hard work, or extra socializing, or self- pitching, but by lending his apartment to his coworkers' extra-martial affairs. Being a 60's film, this cannot be said directly, but the hinting is so strong you pick up instantly. The film is quite liberal, content-wise. The film shows that blackmail goes both ways: Baxter may believe he has the upper hand, with his clients on a string... but he does not, and he sinks deeper into his lie. Of course it comes across humorously, with his neighbours scolding him for his 'sexpot' antics, though the good doctor would also like if his body could be donated to science. Baxter is quite a character, an innocent everyman with his own set of faults and quirks. Lemmon is magnetic: we always root for Lemmon, even as he tells pitiful lies to his landlady and can't stand up to his clients. Even his borderline creepy knowledge of Ms. Kubelik comes off as just charm. An immensely likable character. The object of his affection, Fran Kubelik, is also quite a charmer. Her problem is men, but she knows it. She doesn't fake innocence. We have all known that flirty girl who ends up on your nerves... but Fran isn't that girl. Wilder knows just how to handle his characters. Now, more than 50 years after its release, trying to look at The Apartment academically is strange, because its era has passed. Things like that don't happen any more. Right? Perhaps not as specifically, but the cost of power is a universal theme. What do you sacrifice to try and get ahead? Property, dignity, even your love? C.C. Baxter knows how much he'll give, but also what he won't. The film ends positively, which is nice, and deserving, especially after seeing Sunset Blvd. The Apartment is wonderful, sharply written and performed, and makes a great evening. 8.9/10

    I'm not one of those people who demands that all movies adhere to some sort of realism, especially comedies, or that all characters behave as people do in the real world. But I do expect a movie to give me at least one character who isn't a complete jerk, or a complete moron, or both. Alas, "The Apartment" offers plenty of morons, many of whom are also jerks. Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, may be the biggest moron in the film. He is a bit of a jerk as well, in that his motives consist primarily of career advancement. His doctor neighbor tells him as much (even if his impression of Baxter is distorted, which Baxter does nothing to correct). Baxter's superiors at the company are likewise flawed; they are using him to gain access to his apartment, as if there aren't other arrangements they could make in the entire borough of Manhattan. Of course the humble elevator girl, Fran, is the smartest of the bunch. But she isn't the brightest bulb on the circuit either. The weakest section of the film concerns her suicide attempt, enabled by a bottle of Seconal which is inexplicably left lying around the bathroom. Suddenly a light romantic comedy is thrust into noirish bathos, from which it never really emerges until the final scene. I've never been a fan of Lemmon's, and this film is a great example why. His acting style is so broad, so cloying, that it's impossible to take him seriously later on when he finally stands up to his boss over rights to the apartment. Shirley MacLaine, on the other hand, is outstanding. Just 25 when shooting started, she is acting rings around the rest of the cast. Too bad the Beattys didn't have more children -- acting clearly runs in the family. "The Apartment" tries to be two movies -- rom com and noir -- and in the end succeeds at neither. Billy Wilder, a very fine director, would've done better sticking to one genre and developing the characters (maybe dumping a few extraneous ones in the process).

Too bad the Beattys didn't have more children -- acting clearly runs in the family. "The Apartment" tries to be two movies -- rom com and noir -- and in the end succeeds at neither. Billy Wilder, a very fine director, would've done better sticking to one genre and developing the characters (maybe dumping a few extraneous ones in the process).

    A timeless classic in director Billy Wilder's typical anti-establishment satirical style, this is one of Jack Lemmon's best imho. He plays the protagonist CC Baxter, working in a large insurance firm in New York City, just one of many faces in a sea of desks and office machines on a floor of the building. Though he is surrounded by a multitude of people in and out of the office, he is alone socially, having no visible family nor close friends. The main diversion (if it can be called that) he has is lending out his bachelor style apartment to the middle-ranking executives of the insurance firm for their extra-marital trysts, in return they promise him that they will put in a good word with the higher management for him to get promoted to a better position. This he complies with, even if it puts him at such as a disadvantage as having to stand outdoors in freezing weather while waiting for the current occupant to vacate the apartment. In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right. The supposedly funny scenes are not the sort that you would want to guffaw at, maybe just a snicker or two, but on the whole it does have its light moments, mostly based on misunderstanding and misinterpretation of situations, like Baxter's doctor neighbor assuming that he (Baxter) is a womanizing playboy causing a lot of ruckus most nights in his apartment when actually it's the doing of others. The fact that he leaves a wastebasket full of empty alcohol bottles (courtesy of the executive's liaisons) outside his door doesn't help improve his standing in the doc's eyes either. If by definition of romance, one would expect hot steamy kissing and bed scenes, then prepare for disappointment, as this movie contains none of that. Baxter does eventually fall for pretty elevator operator Fran Kubelik (played so expertly by Shirley McLaine), but does so in a modulated, hesitant way, and only because circumstances begin to arise such that she ends up in his apartment (after being left behind by her lover Sheldrake), and he's left to pick up the pieces of her failed romance literally, just like he's left to collect the litter left behind in his apartment by his higher up bosses after their dalliances. Fred McMurray is memorable as the sleazy despicable Personnel Director Jeff Sheldrake, a role as far from what we expect from McMurray, who usually plays nice guy in previous movies. He is deliciously detestable in playing on the emotions of Kubelik, making her think that he truly loves her and will divorce his present wife to marry her. The other characters - the middle ranking managers, the office workers, etc serve merely as cogs to fill in the completeness of the wheel to get the story going. All in all this is a very watchable film, and one deserving to rank as one of the classics in film history.

    ... as for films by Wilder, I like e.g. Some Like It Hot much more. Lemmon and McLaine are brilliant, of course, but there is not so much comedy within, you feel often sadness and compassion. Black-and-white background does not provide something extra, on the contrary - and it is still 1960 when several color films had already been made. Generally the idea of the script is nice, providing an opportunity to create a lot of crazy confusions and puttering around. Wilder has grabbed this opportunity in full, being undoubtedly a great director and producer. But somehow I feel that The Apartment would not have received so many Academy Awards decades later, it has become timeworn.

    Billy Wilder is one of the most highly regarded directors of his generation and The Apartment is one of his most acclaimed films. The Apartment is a funny and dramatic, aimed with a script that is witty and tragic. Both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have great chemistry and give great performances, Lemmon giving a nervous energy to his character, a little like Woody Allen but much less self-obsessed whilst MacLaine has plenty of charm and wit, but also has tragedy about her. The comedy is gentle amidst the controversial material for the time, filled with witty lines, character interactions and subtle sight gags. We get plenty of melodrama and the characters go through typical arcs, but the screenplay is so well written and the direction and acting that it makes The Apartment a rewarding experience, even during its darkest moments.

    The Apartment starts off in a very catchy way by an original, dynamic, finely directed plot that arouses curiosity and impatience as to the following developments. Unfortunately, the movie turns, after an hour, into a behind closed doors love story, where the rhythm drops significantly simultaneously with the interest for this conventional and schmaltzy romance. The film then struggles to find a second wind and this second part turns out to be very long, so much so that the viewer is almost relieved when it comes to an end. It's a bit of a shame because, besides the cast and direction both accurate, the script suggests a cynical critic of the unmerciful world of business, the race for profit and individual success, foreshadowing, relatively speaking, other works on the dehumanization of work such as Brazil  think of the shot of the lined up desks.

    "The Apartment" is perhaps the greatest achievement in Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder's highlight-filled careers. Many critics find its story gentler than some of Wilder's other films such as "Ace in the Hole" and "Double Indemnity," but I don't detect any artistic compromise. Wilder creates a believable, full-fledged love story that exists alongside the familiar dark humor, snappy dialogue, and depictions of immoral behavior that characterize most of his movies. Rather than diluting these essential Wilderian elements, the addition of a likable everyman--whom Jack Lemmon plays with perfection--throws them into sharper relief through contrast.

    This absolute delight from 1960 is one of Billy Wilder's best works. His Direction of the always wonderful Jack Lemmon and stunning beauty Shirley MacLaine is up there with the best of his generation. The audience can't help but be sympathetic to Lemmon's character, and root for requited love of MacLaines character. Lemmon should have won the Best Actor nod. The mixture of comedy and drama is very appealing to mass audiences, and I feel this picture will be a new favorite for fans of Lemmon or Wilder who may not be familiar with their always genius collaborations. Take some time to check it out!

    The Apartment is a story that sparkles with a scintillating script, humour, and interesting characters as employees of a large insurance company come into conflict with each other. The story set in mid-20th century Manhattan is considered a "classic". The acting, the mix of characters and script are outstanding. New York City, 1959 is written all over it. The bar scenes, the office Christmas party, the walk-up apartment on the Upper West Side, the White Plains home of one of the executives all evoke the era. Jack Lemmon is C.C. Baxter a young employee trying to climb the greasy pole of success in a huge Manhattan insurance company. Shirley MacLaine is Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the company's office skyscraper, who falls in love with one of the higher-ups, and Fred McMurray is Jeff Sheldrake, director of personnel. All deliver great performances with a strong supporting cast. The movie presents the characters, particularly Kubelik and Baxter,in ethical dilemmas and as the movie goes along, we see these two come to grips with how they are living out their lives. A great movie by director Billy Wilder, who created some heavyweight movies like Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Some Like It Hot, and Sunset Boulevard. The movie held my interest from scene to scene. It is superbly acted, and very funny.

    The simplicity of storytelling is what's missing in most romantic comedies these days, especially the x dozens of repetitively formulaic over-commercialized New York centered films. Even though it touches on themes like labour exploitation, sex and infidelity there's a certain innocence and purity in 'The Apartment' which is evident in most Billy Wilder films. This is a key ingredient missing in most of the recent Hollywood films of that genre. Like most of Wilder's classics, the dialogues are smooth, witty, simplistic and funny. There's hardly any overly melodramatic moment here. Plus, who better than Lemmon to play the common man and Maclaine to play the smart, classy yet vulnerable lass. Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine were a very successful pair on screen. 'The Apartment' is one of theirs and Billy Wilder's finest films. Romance at its best.

    Billy Wilder is a really swell guy. He takes serious matter and makes it entertaining: Sunset Blvd. blew me away, and now The Apartment has put a big smile on my face. Wilder injects this uppity- atmosphere into almost every scene and it makes the film a pleasure to watch, no matter how serious the plot gets. And behind the charm of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, there is a serious plot. The Apartment is about Baxter, a New York business cog, trying to move up in his company not through hard work, or extra socializing, or self- pitching, but by lending his apartment to his coworkers' extra-martial affairs. Being a 60's film, this cannot be said directly, but the hinting is so strong you pick up instantly. The film is quite liberal, content-wise. The film shows that blackmail goes both ways: Baxter may believe he has the upper hand, with his clients on a string... but he does not, and he sinks deeper into his lie. Of course it comes across humorously, with his neighbours scolding him for his 'sexpot' antics, though the good doctor would also like if his body could be donated to science. Baxter is quite a character, an innocent everyman with his own set of faults and quirks. Lemmon is magnetic: we always root for Lemmon, even as he tells pitiful lies to his landlady and can't stand up to his clients. Even his borderline creepy knowledge of Ms. Kubelik comes off as just charm. An immensely likable character. The object of his affection, Fran Kubelik, is also quite a charmer. Her problem is men, but she knows it. She doesn't fake innocence. We have all known that flirty girl who ends up on your nerves... but Fran isn't that girl. Wilder knows just how to handle his characters. Now, more than 50 years after its release, trying to look at The Apartment academically is strange, because its era has passed. Things like that don't happen any more. Right? Perhaps not as specifically, but the cost of power is a universal theme. What do you sacrifice to try and get ahead? Property, dignity, even your love? C.C. Baxter knows how much he'll give, but also what he won't. The film ends positively, which is nice, and deserving, especially after seeing Sunset Blvd. The Apartment is wonderful, sharply written and performed, and makes a great evening. 8.9/10

    I'm not one of those people who demands that all movies adhere to some sort of realism, especially comedies, or that all characters behave as people do in the real world. But I do expect a movie to give me at least one character who isn't a complete jerk, or a complete moron, or both. Alas, "The Apartment" offers plenty of morons, many of whom are also jerks. Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, may be the biggest moron in the film. He is a bit of a jerk as well, in that his motives consist primarily of career advancement. His doctor neighbor tells him as much (even if his impression of Baxter is distorted, which Baxter does nothing to correct). Baxter's superiors at the company are likewise flawed; they are using him to gain access to his apartment, as if there aren't other arrangements they could make in the entire borough of Manhattan. Of course the humble elevator girl, Fran, is the smartest of the bunch. But she isn't the brightest bulb on the circuit either. The weakest section of the film concerns her suicide attempt, enabled by a bottle of Seconal which is inexplicably left lying around the bathroom. Suddenly a light romantic comedy is thrust into noirish bathos, from which it never really emerges until the final scene. I've never been a fan of Lemmon's, and this film is a great example why. His acting style is so broad, so cloying, that it's impossible to take him seriously later on when he finally stands up to his boss over rights to the apartment. Shirley MacLaine, on the other hand, is outstanding. Just 25 when shooting started, she is acting rings around the rest of the cast. Too bad the Beattys didn't have more children -- acting clearly runs in the family. "The Apartment" tries to be two movies -- rom com and noir -- and in the end succeeds at neither. Billy Wilder, a very fine director, would've done better sticking to one genre and developing the characters (maybe dumping a few extraneous ones in the process).

The weakest section of the film concerns her suicide attempt, enabled by a bottle of Seconal which is inexplicably left lying around the bathroom. Suddenly a light romantic comedy is thrust into noirish bathos, from which it never really emerges until the final scene. I've never been a fan of Lemmon's, and this film is a great example why. His acting style is so broad, so cloying, that it's impossible to take him seriously later on when he finally stands up to his boss over rights to the apartment. Shirley MacLaine, on the other hand, is outstanding. Just 25 when shooting started, she is acting rings around the rest of the cast. Too bad the Beattys didn't have more children -- acting clearly runs in the family. "The Apartment" tries to be two movies -- rom com and noir -- and in the end succeeds at neither. Billy Wilder, a very fine director, would've done better sticking to one genre and developing the characters (maybe dumping a few extraneous ones in the process).

    A timeless classic in director Billy Wilder's typical anti-establishment satirical style, this is one of Jack Lemmon's best imho. He plays the protagonist CC Baxter, working in a large insurance firm in New York City, just one of many faces in a sea of desks and office machines on a floor of the building. Though he is surrounded by a multitude of people in and out of the office, he is alone socially, having no visible family nor close friends. The main diversion (if it can be called that) he has is lending out his bachelor style apartment to the middle-ranking executives of the insurance firm for their extra-marital trysts, in return they promise him that they will put in a good word with the higher management for him to get promoted to a better position. This he complies with, even if it puts him at such as a disadvantage as having to stand outdoors in freezing weather while waiting for the current occupant to vacate the apartment. In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right. The supposedly funny scenes are not the sort that you would want to guffaw at, maybe just a snicker or two, but on the whole it does have its light moments, mostly based on misunderstanding and misinterpretation of situations, like Baxter's doctor neighbor assuming that he (Baxter) is a womanizing playboy causing a lot of ruckus most nights in his apartment when actually it's the doing of others. The fact that he leaves a wastebasket full of empty alcohol bottles (courtesy of the executive's liaisons) outside his door doesn't help improve his standing in the doc's eyes either. If by definition of romance, one would expect hot steamy kissing and bed scenes, then prepare for disappointment, as this movie contains none of that. Baxter does eventually fall for pretty elevator operator Fran Kubelik (played so expertly by Shirley McLaine), but does so in a modulated, hesitant way, and only because circumstances begin to arise such that she ends up in his apartment (after being left behind by her lover Sheldrake), and he's left to pick up the pieces of her failed romance literally, just like he's left to collect the litter left behind in his apartment by his higher up bosses after their dalliances. Fred McMurray is memorable as the sleazy despicable Personnel Director Jeff Sheldrake, a role as far from what we expect from McMurray, who usually plays nice guy in previous movies. He is deliciously detestable in playing on the emotions of Kubelik, making her think that he truly loves her and will divorce his present wife to marry her. The other characters - the middle ranking managers, the office workers, etc serve merely as cogs to fill in the completeness of the wheel to get the story going. All in all this is a very watchable film, and one deserving to rank as one of the classics in film history.

    ... as for films by Wilder, I like e.g. Some Like It Hot much more. Lemmon and McLaine are brilliant, of course, but there is not so much comedy within, you feel often sadness and compassion. Black-and-white background does not provide something extra, on the contrary - and it is still 1960 when several color films had already been made. Generally the idea of the script is nice, providing an opportunity to create a lot of crazy confusions and puttering around. Wilder has grabbed this opportunity in full, being undoubtedly a great director and producer. But somehow I feel that The Apartment would not have received so many Academy Awards decades later, it has become timeworn.
