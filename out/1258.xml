    Put Jeff Daniels, Michael Richards, Rip Torn and Austin Pendleton in a courtroom together and you have a riotous comedy. I've watched this film several times (on TV--not in the theater) and it always entertains. In a backwoods Nevada town, Jeff Daniels and friend Michael Richards come to celebrate his upcoming marriage. After too much liquor, the roles are reversed as Jeff Daniels can't continue as lawyer for defendant Rip Torn, so out-of-work actor Michael Richards steps in as Torn's lawyer The repartee in the courtroom is classic, with a frustrated Austin Pendleton as judge trying to keep order in the court, and the shyster Rip Torn clueless as to what's going on, adds up to one funny film. And Charlize Theron as the love interest isn't hard to take either. This is a laugh-out-loud film with some great slapstick and wild antics. I loved it.

    Funny, and committed to a fun time with actors blazing their talents without a care in the world other than entertainment for entertainments' sake. Sometimes that is all that is needed when you are down, I have been down and this has lifted me up again (& again)... this movie has been a mainstay in my collection of movies to look to for a good time and has never let me down. Good Job! Look for an early play by Charlize Theron and don't forget to look for who is now George Stephanopolous' wife as the bitter Fianc&eacute;e. And Thanks for many a night of joy and happiness ( since I watch it over and over again!) So, thanks!

    If this film is inspired by my cousin Vinny they did a good job.The only reason to watch this film is if you like Jeff and Mike. They both give you the characters they have built their carers on. Mike stumbles around Jeff makes his funny faces. The plot is very simple. Lawyer caught in a lie and good girl helps him find himself. That said Charlize may be one of the most beautiful woman in the world. Oh and Jenny Coolidge is so fun. If you are reading this Jenny, you are way more than Stiffler's mom. I think you have a suspense comedy drama in you. You should talk to the Coen Bros. Especially Ethan could write you a Oscar winner. Back to Trial and error, its worth a rainy night watch. Just don't expect too much. I wouldn't watch it twice.

    Jonathan Lynn's 'Trial and Error' is Strictly Time-Pass Entertainment! Its a fairly engaging comedy, that comes in-tact with earnest performances from its cast. 'Trial and Error' Synopsis: An actor poses as a lawyer to help his sick friend, and problems develop. 'Trial and Error' stands perfect as a lazy Sunday afternoon watch. A light entertainer, that offers some good jokes & performances. Sara Bernstein & Gregory Bernstein's Screenplay is fairly engaging. Jonathan Lynn's Direction is fine. Performance-Wise: Jeff Daniels is a joy to watch, as always. The under-rated actor puts up another excellent performance. Michael Richards does very well. Charlize Theron looks stunning as ever & is perfect. Rip Torn is as usual. On the whole, 'Trial and Error' is time-pass.

    Charlie Tuttle is a workaholic lawyer who just made partner at his law firm and is also engaged to his boss's daughter; his best friend Richard Rietti is an out of work actor who throws him a wild bachelor party the night before Charlie has to defend his boss's relative. When Charlie is too incapacitated to appear in court the next morning, Richard assumes his identity but gets in over his head when the case is ordered to proceed. Director Lynn, who employed a similar formula in My Cousin Vinny, avoids turning this into a strained redo thanks to the pairing of Richards and Daniels who play exceptionally well off one another, aided by a script that offers plenty of clever and very funny moments, and a surprisingly effective romantic subplot. Good casting, writing, and laughs make this more fun than it should be. ***

    Well, I loved it. But I felt it could have had more laughs. Take for instance the improvisations of the substitute lawyer, they were all disappointed. The matter of missing the session by mixed horns, it wasn't exploited well. Or the character of the judge; all out of use. In brief; every time this movie has the opportunity to make fun, it retracts. Is it laziness ? Average sense of comedy ? Whatever the reason is, while having the irony (Trial and Error) doesn't use it well, or doesn't use it. On the contrary, it has so wonderful meaning about stopping the lying, in a way most of the similar movies didn't have. The moment of the concluding pleading is heartwarming and overwhelming. It sums up the movie's core perfectly. Sad that with stronger comedy, this could have been evenly perfect movie itself. I loved the scene of (Jeff Daniels) talking about the early-brilliant's tragedy, the one who lives a chain reaction of being superior then less and less as time goes by. It's the scary opposite relationship between intelligence and freedom. More intelligence equals less freedom, hence less happiness. This movie shows it in impressive simplicity, running as a play on the main theme as well, whereas the character used to lie, yet on himself, as if he's happy while he isn't. Slight bugging matters : the strange biker had been pictured first as (Daniels)'s attention line and fascinating fantasy (with one important zoon-in); that was confusing a bit, especially when we discover lately that she'd be his friend's girl. Then, how come (Charlize Theron) forgave (Daniels) that simple, I still can't explain the big hug near the end knowing the hurting slap she got hours ago by his arrogant fianc&eacute;e ?! And lastly, the movie leaves us, incredibly happy, while its 2 leading men could, or would, meet many years in jail for what they already have done. They both are going to be exposed easily. Not to mention what job exactly (Daniels) will have ? I mean when a movie like this doesn't answer questions like these, even by swift answers, then whether it prepares for a sequel or something was hasty about its ending. (Jeff Daniels) is a fair actor, but not a great comedian, besides he lacks the charismatic persona. (Michael Richards) is a nice talent. Look at his super slapstick comedy in his audition scene (I don't know what these examiners were uneasy about ?!). Or to the way he performed his serious scenes. Accordingly I don't know why he couldn't make a cinematic career away from his trademark Cosmo Kramer of "Seinfeld" ?! What I do know is that he didn't have a proper chance to blossom and flourish. (Rip Torn) and (Charlize Theron), with more capturing presence and talent, surpassed (Daniels) and (Richards). (Theron) in specific looked like fresh dream, and despite her short experience back then, she acted so naturally. It's smooth and meaningful afternoon movie. I began to feel that this term, afternoon movie, got a lot to do with the light movies. As if the more complicated or satisfied ones are more fit for the night. As a comedy it could have been better if only it wasn't full of too many anti-climaxes, where you're about to laugh, then you're not. It's where I desired a remake for the very movie I was watching !

    I think it was about five years ago when I first discovered that this 1997 lawyer comedy existed. It took me this long to finally get around to seeing it, even though I've been familiar with the two stars for quite some time now. I've seen Jeff Daniels as Jim Carrey's co-star in "Dumb & Dumber", and knew the now infamous Michael Richards obviously for his role as Kramer in the popular sitcom, "Seinfeld", plus his roles in comedy films such as "UHF" and "So I Married an Axe Murderer". Since I had seen both of these actors in funny movies/TV shows, I figured I might find "Trial and Error" mildly amusing, nothing more, judging by its general reception. Expecting a mixed blessing, I didn't get any big surprises, pleasant or unpleasant. Charles Tuttle (Daniels) is a lawyer who will soon be married. His best friend, and best man for the wedding, is an out-of-work actor named Richard Rietti (Richards). Tuttle has been called over to Paradise Bluff, Nevada to defend his fianc&eacute;e's relative, Benny Gibbs, in a class action fraud suit. When he arrives in the town, Richard (or "Ricky") is there, and is ready to throw a bachelor party for his friend. After drinking and getting attacked in the bar, Charlie is not well enough to work the next day, so Ricky decides to go to the courtroom and claim to be a lawyer named Charles Tuttle! Charlie is not happy when he hears what Ricky has done, and soon finds that he now has to pose as an actor named Richard Rietti! Since the real Rietti is not trained to be a lawyer, the real Charlie pretends to be his assistant, using cue cards to tell him what to do on the job while he defends Benny. Obviously, this leads to a horrible mess! There weren't too many times when I laughed really hard while watching this 1997 comedy, but there were many parts I found at least mildly amusing. I can't forget Ricky discovering that his sick friend in bed has emptied out his pill bottle, Ricky trying to prepare Charlie for the trial while he is ill, Charlie's reaction when he learns what Ricky has done, and many things the main characters go through while they pose as each other. Michael Richards and Jeff Daniels are a good pair in the lead roles, which might be the main reason why this film is funny. Richards, with his over-the-top antics, playing a character with good intentions who keeps lousing up, and Daniels, with some of the faces he makes and his character's reactions to Ricky's doings. Unfortunately, the plot isn't too interesting, and if the film were hilarious, that wouldn't matter, but it's not funny enough to prevent the movie from being a little dull. Also, the romance wasn't done so well, eventually getting a little sappy, and the ending leaves much to be desired. This movie came out the same year as "Liar Liar", another lawyer comedy. That film is definitely the more popular of the two, but I have to be honest, I prefer this one, as crazy as many people might think I am for that. While Jim Carrey has made me laugh in other films, I found that his antics went too far in that one. Richards and Daniels, while not usually hilarious in the film, are still pretty funny. I'm sure we all know about Richards' racist tirade in November 2006, which obviously permanently damaged his reputation and started a never ending debate over whether he really meant what he said and whether his apology was honest or not. It clearly had more impact than Mel Gibson's tirade earlier that year, and the main reason for that was probably because Richards was caught on video. I remember feeling like I could never watch anything with Richards in it again after I first heard about the incident and saw the footage, but now, regardless of his reputation and what may go on in his head, I have to admit, he can still make me laugh in the comedies I see him in. If you like the two co-stars in "Trial and Error" as comedians, then this flick could easily make you laugh, or at least some parts could.

    This is an interesting and hilariously funny movie! A lawyer about to get married is incapacitated after a bachelor party just prior to a court appearance on a routine case where he represents the defendant. His buddy, an unemployed actor, takes his place at the trial for what is supposed to be a 5 minute appearance. The attractive female prosecutor wants to move on with the case, and the substitute lawyer is committed to participate in the trial. The recovering real lawyer meets a cute waitress and enjoys her company on his day off, only later to find that his friend's errors in court force a continued role as his doppelganger. The courtroom scenes are are absolutely hilarious, as are the off-courtroom romantic entanglements of both friends. Don't miss this movie! It's the kind you will enjoy seeing over and over again.

    Lots of A-list actors, simple story to follow with light hearted humor. Another movie showing how beautiful Charlize Theron is, fans of her will appreciate that. Michael Richards is funny as always. Jeff Daniels is very good, none of that stupid humor like in Dumb and Dumber. Austin Pendleton plays his typical character, goofy yet professional. The whole movie is very predictable but the actors that are cast keep it interesting. Recommend watching it without great expectations. So for a relaxing afternoon stick a bag of popcorn in the microwave and rent this movie for an hour and a half of a good story with entertaining acting.

    Taped this film which was shown in the wee wee hours of the night and decided I had nothing to lose. The plot starts out with a guy who is a young lawyer recently out of Yale who is in the process of marrying a gal who has a dad who is very rich. This lawyer is bossed around by his intended bride and even gets a fancy corner office given by this girls father. The father sends his son-in-law to be to a remote small town in Boonville, USA and he meets up with Charlize Theron, (Billie Tyler) and plenty of things start to happen to his life. Jessica Stein,(Elizabeth Gardner) gives a great supporting role. If it were not for these two women in the picture, it would simply Stand on Its Head.

A lawyer about to get married is incapacitated after a bachelor party just prior to a court appearance on a routine case where he represents the defendant. His buddy, an unemployed actor, takes his place at the trial for what is supposed to be a 5 minute appearance. The attractive female prosecutor wants to move on with the case, and the substitute lawyer is committed to participate in the trial. The recovering real lawyer meets a cute waitress and enjoys her company on his day off, only later to find that his friend's errors in court force a continued role as his doppelganger. The courtroom scenes are are absolutely hilarious, as are the off-courtroom romantic entanglements of both friends. Don't miss this movie! It's the kind you will enjoy seeing over and over again.

    Lots of A-list actors, simple story to follow with light hearted humor. Another movie showing how beautiful Charlize Theron is, fans of her will appreciate that. Michael Richards is funny as always. Jeff Daniels is very good, none of that stupid humor like in Dumb and Dumber. Austin Pendleton plays his typical character, goofy yet professional. The whole movie is very predictable but the actors that are cast keep it interesting. Recommend watching it without great expectations. So for a relaxing afternoon stick a bag of popcorn in the microwave and rent this movie for an hour and a half of a good story with entertaining acting.

    Taped this film which was shown in the wee wee hours of the night and decided I had nothing to lose. The plot starts out with a guy who is a young lawyer recently out of Yale who is in the process of marrying a gal who has a dad who is very rich. This lawyer is bossed around by his intended bride and even gets a fancy corner office given by this girls father. The father sends his son-in-law to be to a remote small town in Boonville, USA and he meets up with Charlize Theron, (Billie Tyler) and plenty of things start to happen to his life. Jessica Stein,(Elizabeth Gardner) gives a great supporting role. If it were not for these two women in the picture, it would simply Stand on Its Head.

    Put Jeff Daniels, Michael Richards, Rip Torn and Austin Pendleton in a courtroom together and you have a riotous comedy. I've watched this film several times (on TV--not in the theater) and it always entertains. In a backwoods Nevada town, Jeff Daniels and friend Michael Richards come to celebrate his upcoming marriage. After too much liquor, the roles are reversed as Jeff Daniels can't continue as lawyer for defendant Rip Torn, so out-of-work actor Michael Richards steps in as Torn's lawyer The repartee in the courtroom is classic, with a frustrated Austin Pendleton as judge trying to keep order in the court, and the shyster Rip Torn clueless as to what's going on, adds up to one funny film. And Charlize Theron as the love interest isn't hard to take either. This is a laugh-out-loud film with some great slapstick and wild antics. I loved it.

    Funny, and committed to a fun time with actors blazing their talents without a care in the world other than entertainment for entertainments' sake. Sometimes that is all that is needed when you are down, I have been down and this has lifted me up again (& again)... this movie has been a mainstay in my collection of movies to look to for a good time and has never let me down. Good Job! Look for an early play by Charlize Theron and don't forget to look for who is now George Stephanopolous' wife as the bitter Fianc&eacute;e. And Thanks for many a night of joy and happiness ( since I watch it over and over again!) So, thanks!

    If this film is inspired by my cousin Vinny they did a good job.The only reason to watch this film is if you like Jeff and Mike. They both give you the characters they have built their carers on. Mike stumbles around Jeff makes his funny faces. The plot is very simple. Lawyer caught in a lie and good girl helps him find himself. That said Charlize may be one of the most beautiful woman in the world. Oh and Jenny Coolidge is so fun. If you are reading this Jenny, you are way more than Stiffler's mom. I think you have a suspense comedy drama in you. You should talk to the Coen Bros. Especially Ethan could write you a Oscar winner. Back to Trial and error, its worth a rainy night watch. Just don't expect too much. I wouldn't watch it twice.

    Jonathan Lynn's 'Trial and Error' is Strictly Time-Pass Entertainment! Its a fairly engaging comedy, that comes in-tact with earnest performances from its cast. 'Trial and Error' Synopsis: An actor poses as a lawyer to help his sick friend, and problems develop. 'Trial and Error' stands perfect as a lazy Sunday afternoon watch. A light entertainer, that offers some good jokes & performances. Sara Bernstein & Gregory Bernstein's Screenplay is fairly engaging. Jonathan Lynn's Direction is fine. Performance-Wise: Jeff Daniels is a joy to watch, as always. The under-rated actor puts up another excellent performance. Michael Richards does very well. Charlize Theron looks stunning as ever & is perfect. Rip Torn is as usual. On the whole, 'Trial and Error' is time-pass.

    Charlie Tuttle is a workaholic lawyer who just made partner at his law firm and is also engaged to his boss's daughter; his best friend Richard Rietti is an out of work actor who throws him a wild bachelor party the night before Charlie has to defend his boss's relative. When Charlie is too incapacitated to appear in court the next morning, Richard assumes his identity but gets in over his head when the case is ordered to proceed. Director Lynn, who employed a similar formula in My Cousin Vinny, avoids turning this into a strained redo thanks to the pairing of Richards and Daniels who play exceptionally well off one another, aided by a script that offers plenty of clever and very funny moments, and a surprisingly effective romantic subplot. Good casting, writing, and laughs make this more fun than it should be. ***

    Well, I loved it. But I felt it could have had more laughs. Take for instance the improvisations of the substitute lawyer, they were all disappointed. The matter of missing the session by mixed horns, it wasn't exploited well. Or the character of the judge; all out of use. In brief; every time this movie has the opportunity to make fun, it retracts. Is it laziness ? Average sense of comedy ? Whatever the reason is, while having the irony (Trial and Error) doesn't use it well, or doesn't use it. On the contrary, it has so wonderful meaning about stopping the lying, in a way most of the similar movies didn't have. The moment of the concluding pleading is heartwarming and overwhelming. It sums up the movie's core perfectly. Sad that with stronger comedy, this could have been evenly perfect movie itself. I loved the scene of (Jeff Daniels) talking about the early-brilliant's tragedy, the one who lives a chain reaction of being superior then less and less as time goes by. It's the scary opposite relationship between intelligence and freedom. More intelligence equals less freedom, hence less happiness. This movie shows it in impressive simplicity, running as a play on the main theme as well, whereas the character used to lie, yet on himself, as if he's happy while he isn't. Slight bugging matters : the strange biker had been pictured first as (Daniels)'s attention line and fascinating fantasy (with one important zoon-in); that was confusing a bit, especially when we discover lately that she'd be his friend's girl. Then, how come (Charlize Theron) forgave (Daniels) that simple, I still can't explain the big hug near the end knowing the hurting slap she got hours ago by his arrogant fianc&eacute;e ?! And lastly, the movie leaves us, incredibly happy, while its 2 leading men could, or would, meet many years in jail for what they already have done. They both are going to be exposed easily. Not to mention what job exactly (Daniels) will have ? I mean when a movie like this doesn't answer questions like these, even by swift answers, then whether it prepares for a sequel or something was hasty about its ending. (Jeff Daniels) is a fair actor, but not a great comedian, besides he lacks the charismatic persona. (Michael Richards) is a nice talent. Look at his super slapstick comedy in his audition scene (I don't know what these examiners were uneasy about ?!). Or to the way he performed his serious scenes. Accordingly I don't know why he couldn't make a cinematic career away from his trademark Cosmo Kramer of "Seinfeld" ?! What I do know is that he didn't have a proper chance to blossom and flourish. (Rip Torn) and (Charlize Theron), with more capturing presence and talent, surpassed (Daniels) and (Richards). (Theron) in specific looked like fresh dream, and despite her short experience back then, she acted so naturally. It's smooth and meaningful afternoon movie. I began to feel that this term, afternoon movie, got a lot to do with the light movies. As if the more complicated or satisfied ones are more fit for the night. As a comedy it could have been better if only it wasn't full of too many anti-climaxes, where you're about to laugh, then you're not. It's where I desired a remake for the very movie I was watching !

    I think it was about five years ago when I first discovered that this 1997 lawyer comedy existed. It took me this long to finally get around to seeing it, even though I've been familiar with the two stars for quite some time now. I've seen Jeff Daniels as Jim Carrey's co-star in "Dumb & Dumber", and knew the now infamous Michael Richards obviously for his role as Kramer in the popular sitcom, "Seinfeld", plus his roles in comedy films such as "UHF" and "So I Married an Axe Murderer". Since I had seen both of these actors in funny movies/TV shows, I figured I might find "Trial and Error" mildly amusing, nothing more, judging by its general reception. Expecting a mixed blessing, I didn't get any big surprises, pleasant or unpleasant. Charles Tuttle (Daniels) is a lawyer who will soon be married. His best friend, and best man for the wedding, is an out-of-work actor named Richard Rietti (Richards). Tuttle has been called over to Paradise Bluff, Nevada to defend his fianc&eacute;e's relative, Benny Gibbs, in a class action fraud suit. When he arrives in the town, Richard (or "Ricky") is there, and is ready to throw a bachelor party for his friend. After drinking and getting attacked in the bar, Charlie is not well enough to work the next day, so Ricky decides to go to the courtroom and claim to be a lawyer named Charles Tuttle! Charlie is not happy when he hears what Ricky has done, and soon finds that he now has to pose as an actor named Richard Rietti! Since the real Rietti is not trained to be a lawyer, the real Charlie pretends to be his assistant, using cue cards to tell him what to do on the job while he defends Benny. Obviously, this leads to a horrible mess! There weren't too many times when I laughed really hard while watching this 1997 comedy, but there were many parts I found at least mildly amusing. I can't forget Ricky discovering that his sick friend in bed has emptied out his pill bottle, Ricky trying to prepare Charlie for the trial while he is ill, Charlie's reaction when he learns what Ricky has done, and many things the main characters go through while they pose as each other. Michael Richards and Jeff Daniels are a good pair in the lead roles, which might be the main reason why this film is funny. Richards, with his over-the-top antics, playing a character with good intentions who keeps lousing up, and Daniels, with some of the faces he makes and his character's reactions to Ricky's doings. Unfortunately, the plot isn't too interesting, and if the film were hilarious, that wouldn't matter, but it's not funny enough to prevent the movie from being a little dull. Also, the romance wasn't done so well, eventually getting a little sappy, and the ending leaves much to be desired. This movie came out the same year as "Liar Liar", another lawyer comedy. That film is definitely the more popular of the two, but I have to be honest, I prefer this one, as crazy as many people might think I am for that. While Jim Carrey has made me laugh in other films, I found that his antics went too far in that one. Richards and Daniels, while not usually hilarious in the film, are still pretty funny. I'm sure we all know about Richards' racist tirade in November 2006, which obviously permanently damaged his reputation and started a never ending debate over whether he really meant what he said and whether his apology was honest or not. It clearly had more impact than Mel Gibson's tirade earlier that year, and the main reason for that was probably because Richards was caught on video. I remember feeling like I could never watch anything with Richards in it again after I first heard about the incident and saw the footage, but now, regardless of his reputation and what may go on in his head, I have to admit, he can still make me laugh in the comedies I see him in. If you like the two co-stars in "Trial and Error" as comedians, then this flick could easily make you laugh, or at least some parts could.

If you like the two co-stars in "Trial and Error" as comedians, then this flick could easily make you laugh, or at least some parts could.

    This is an interesting and hilariously funny movie! A lawyer about to get married is incapacitated after a bachelor party just prior to a court appearance on a routine case where he represents the defendant. His buddy, an unemployed actor, takes his place at the trial for what is supposed to be a 5 minute appearance. The attractive female prosecutor wants to move on with the case, and the substitute lawyer is committed to participate in the trial. The recovering real lawyer meets a cute waitress and enjoys her company on his day off, only later to find that his friend's errors in court force a continued role as his doppelganger. The courtroom scenes are are absolutely hilarious, as are the off-courtroom romantic entanglements of both friends. Don't miss this movie! It's the kind you will enjoy seeing over and over again.

    Lots of A-list actors, simple story to follow with light hearted humor. Another movie showing how beautiful Charlize Theron is, fans of her will appreciate that. Michael Richards is funny as always. Jeff Daniels is very good, none of that stupid humor like in Dumb and Dumber. Austin Pendleton plays his typical character, goofy yet professional. The whole movie is very predictable but the actors that are cast keep it interesting. Recommend watching it without great expectations. So for a relaxing afternoon stick a bag of popcorn in the microwave and rent this movie for an hour and a half of a good story with entertaining acting.

    Taped this film which was shown in the wee wee hours of the night and decided I had nothing to lose. The plot starts out with a guy who is a young lawyer recently out of Yale who is in the process of marrying a gal who has a dad who is very rich. This lawyer is bossed around by his intended bride and even gets a fancy corner office given by this girls father. The father sends his son-in-law to be to a remote small town in Boonville, USA and he meets up with Charlize Theron, (Billie Tyler) and plenty of things start to happen to his life. Jessica Stein,(Elizabeth Gardner) gives a great supporting role. If it were not for these two women in the picture, it would simply Stand on Its Head.
