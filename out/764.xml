    I can't believe some of the reviews I'm reading - so negative! I love this movie. I realize that to watch it now may leave the audience disappointed - but when it came out back in the 90's, this movie was fantastic. The script gave you just enough about the characters that you were able to draw more from their actions to see their vulnerability and insecurities. There are quite funny moments, sweet, sad and interesting. For me it was great to see these characters learn about themselves and what they wanted. I enjoyed this movie very much - and while it may not be Oscar-worthy or ground breaking, it remains one of my favorites.

    Implausible betting, especially the way the script brings it and the performers and the play make it. A few twists of the plot may attract some interest, but overall, the film is perfectly stupid, "eau de rose", despite his unrealistic disguise behind NY American artists. Some gags are trying to make us believe that nothing is serious there, but the insistence of the scenario, the traditional Disney-type music of U.S. cinema, relentlessly trying to highlight ten times with bold lines all the time any love emotion when it is supposed to be present. We feel that it addresses an audience which it does not think too much good about its ability to feel and judge for itself, or is it because if fear of misinterpretation or direction that would betray the intentions of the writer, the author. Why such a thick layer of musical peanut butter (brain?). Sarah Jessica is doing its best, obviously, but has not yet be seen out of the cart of the series B Scenario is rather confused, message stinks the scent of rosewater usual easy clich&eacute;s. Not much to be grabbed out of this, in my opinion.

    A recommendation from Portland, Maine's movie oasis, Videoport! Videoport's Matthew and I may be the only two people in Portland who genuinely a). know who writer/director/star Eric Scheffer is and b). don't think he's weird and annoying. Well, you guys just haven't gotten to know him like we have. This 1996 romantic comedy was Schaeffer's shot at mainstream success and, while that didn't work out, it's remains a refreshingly-odd and affecting antidote to bland 'romantic comedies' like The Wedding Planner, The Wedding Date, My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding or anything with Kate Hudson in it. It's weird that this didn't do better, really, as Schaeffer was savvy (or lucky) enough to have brought in Sarah Jessica Parker and Ben Stiller (right before they really took off) as support; (it's also a bummer that neither of them have reciprocated now that they pull down ten million or so a picture). In this one, Schaeffer plays Joe, Scheffer's usual snaggly, slightly spazzy goof with a soulful side who lives with his best friend Lucy (Parker, getting to act softer and goofier than usual, herself), and who pines helplessly for his unbelievably-gorgeous neighbor, the leggy Jane (played by at-the-peak-of-her-strapping-loveliness Elle MacPherson). He's a painter, she's a therapist, they're both in 29 and sadly single and Jane reminds them of a long-ago promise to kill themselves in a 'death pact' if neither of them is in a real relationship by the time they're 30. Premise! So they both agree to throw caution to the wind for the last month before jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge: Joe will finally court Jane, while Lucy will go out with anyone who asks, leading her to reluctantly accept the off-the-wall advances of famous, fatuous art phenom Bwick Elias (a funny turn by a dreadlocked Stiller). Like I said, I like Schaeffer- he's a unique comic voice and a funny guy with a serious romantic streak, and Parker and Stiller were showing more colors back then before their public personas hardened into commercial product and, if the whole 'death pact' thing doesn't quite pay off, well, it's still an unique way to get things rolling towards the predictable, yet satisfying, conclusion. Great songs by the band Marry Me Jane. Look for a young Scarlett Johansen in a small role. Also, check out Schaeffer's other films Fall, Mind the Gap, Never Again, and Wirey Spindell (sadly, his excellent first comedy My Life's In Turnaround remains out of print), and see if you'll join Matt and me in the Portland chapter of the Eric Schaeffer fan club.

    There was a brief moment in the history of cinema in the 90's when coffe shop hippies made movies. They usually consisted of a stupid idea played out over 90 minutes with a terrible deluded and quiet boring conversations. This movie is one of them. Let me start with the main 2 characters. Both are meant to be finding love and along the way find watch other. But wait you guessed it with a stupid twist along the way to keep the dopple headed crowd cheering along the way. This movies insults its viewer by making a movie around a premise which is so retarded that quiet frankly the director should have been shot. Anyway i digress. (I apolgize to the viewer not director). This movie is filled with that 90's cheese that ozzes from every frame. SJP is just awful and her chemistry with her supposed love interest is as noticeable as a fly on doo doo. Let me save you from this rant/review just do not watch this garbage. It is from an era that spawned some great movies but this was not even close to a rental!

    I am giving this movie 10 stars to compensate for the negative reviews. I am amazed at peoples reactions to this movie as it was really good. But its not surprising that the masses never know whats funny thats why they have audience laughter on TV shows to tell you when to laugh. If you don't have a brain you won't like this movie. I would rate it about an 8 or a 9. It seems Eric Schaeffer is either loved or hated. Ben Stiller is hilarious and Schaeffer's character is a bit of fresh air of seeing an American male who is not a brainwashed insensitive moron. All in all great movie I would recommend to anyone. This requires me to write 10 lines of review so I am continuing to write. Good movie.

    I saw this in the movies. I think it was the one and only time in my entire life I've fallen asleep in public. But that might have been my date. Either way, this movie was terrible. Now, I've seen it again. It wasn't just age or what was going on with my life - or who I was with. This is a terrible movie. The two lead characters who are supposed to be best friends are mean to each other and do not communicate clearly. Joe, the lead "male" and writer of the movie, dresses like a girl - complete with headband and dresses and leggings. In fact, he dresses like a little girl in the 1980's. The lead woman, played by SJP, who I can never hate, is just not likable. Nor does she make sense. One second she likes Ben Stiller's pointless character, the next she's rolling her eyes at him like the rest of us. The base story is interesting and one of my favorites, I won't spoil what that is, but suffice it to say there was plenty of potential. This movie doesn't carry it off. The editing is bad - but perhaps that's mostly the fault of a shallow script and unlikeable characters. The actors can't be faulted. They do their best with virtually no material.

    No mistake, I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did, and I gave it one star. But it's a gold star! A big bright shiny-no wait, that's a finger. Definitely one finger. A middle finger, belonging to me. A long time ago two friends of mine told me they'd just gone to see it, and I made fun of them. Mind you at the time I knew little about the movie other than it had an incredibly stupid name and that Sarah Jessica Parker still looked human. They both told me to shut up because at least I hadn't suffered the movie. Well I never felt really good about my initial response to being told they'd seen it (I literally laughed at them) so when it came on a movie channel last might I decided to check it out. I'll say that I was impressed. Not with Sarah Jessica Parker, who was moving away from pretty (Honeymoon in Vegas pretty) toward the thing from Family Stone. Nor was I impressed with Eric Shaffer (don't know if I spelled that right, don't care-he doesn't' deserve the consideration), who first wrote this horrible movie, then made it, and worst of all cast his own ugly stupid ass in the part that gets Elle Macpherson (I think I spelled that right, checked on her IMDb page and it looks good). And I wasn't impressed by Ben Stiller's moron because, while he did a fine job of playing an idiot, the character lacked any redeeming quality and came across as a prick who tried to act like an artist but who didn't understand art (like the writer/director). What impressed me was that Scarlett Johansson was pretty good at a very young age, that Elle Macpherson acted attracted to an idiot and managed to pull it off a bit and that there was someone in the movie (the old guy) who felt the same way I do about the clown who made the movie. This movie sucked about as badly as a movie can, right up until the clich&eacute; 'realize what they're looking for has been staring them in the face' ending. At that point it fell into that brown, stinky, steaming pile of filth, one of which actually IS the worst ever, the rest being serious contenders. What this movie is missing is something vital to a good date movie. The two leads make a pact to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. A good date movie develops characters that you could potentially like in real life and so you'd rather see them end up happy. Both leads in this suck. They're zeroes, completely lacking in value. I wanted them to jump. One other thing-when I was in college a friend of mine was an art major. Every art major had to exhibit their work openly for anyone who wanted to see. I went to my friend's show and was really surprised. Not because of how good his stuff was (it was and he's made a career of it for almost 15 years now). No, what surprised me was that his wasn't the only exhibit, and that the subject of the other exhibit was---a kid that lived in my dorm. Every picture this chick made (and I think they were all chalk) was this kid in my dorm. Just like in the movie! And when I went to make fun of him for it I couldn't because he thought it so weird and frightening he was afraid to leave his room! Just like in the movie...oh wait, she liked it. I forget that in movies obsession is an appealing quality, peeping is admired and stalking is cool. Having thought about it I think if I ever see Eric Schafer I'll have to give him a good slap.

    This movie is for those of us who are jaded and have fallen for a best friend. If you only fit one of these criteria, you probably will not enjoy the film. The film is set in New York City (and incidentally, only took five weeks to shoot...independent film and whatnot), and centers around two best friends/roommates Joe and Lucy. After Lucy dumps her boyfriend of two years due to lack of spark, Lucy reminds Joe of the "death pact" they made in college--if they both "don't have relationships with serious familial possibility" by the time Lucy turns 30, in 28 days, they would kill themselves. The rest of the film is a picture of the twenty-something dating scene and the quest for The One. Understated moments of humor speckled throughout make the plot line that could potentially be depressing make this film one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I've ever seen. I own it, I watch it often. What I don't get is the mass loathing of Eric Schaeffer. In my opinion, he is one of the most talented guys in Hollywood, and this film is more true to life than most of the other rose-colored-glasses romantic comedy trash out there, where the duologue and storyline are unrealistic and the characters are all way too good looking and self-absorbed to be believable. The only other film I have seen that comes close to this one as far as believability and realism is "The Mirror Has Two Faces". (did I just call Babs non-self-absorbed and believable? lol I think I did!) I read one comment that's bashing Mr. Schaeffer for his looks...have we all so fully bought into the media's perception of what is beautiful that we have to bash someone for not being the stereotypical romantic hero? Do we read too many romance novels that if a man doesn't look like Fabio on the cover, we automatically dismiss him as not worth our time? Ridiculous. I, for one, think Schaeffer is attractive, but it's more his personality...which in this film is quirky, yes, but also endearing and real. Fabulous performances by Schaeffer, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ben Stiller, Elle MacPherson, Dominic Chianese as the old guy in the wheelchair outside the store (can't remember his character name at the moment)...even the kids in Joe's school...and wonderful writing and direction by Schaeffer make this film a must see. Bravo!

    Platonic best friends and roommates Sarah Jessica Parker (a therapist who's bored with her clients) and Eric Schaeffer (a struggling artist who also teaches art to kids) are frustrated over their lackluster love lives and recall a pact they made years before: if they're both without partners at the age of 30, they will jump off the Brooklyn Bridge together. Romantic comedy alternates between being jaded and sentimental; it has flashes of satirical wit--but only flashes. Sarah Jessica Parker doesn't have much of a character here, and she compensates for this by doing silly bits of business (stretching, giggling, making faces). The most natural performance in the film is turned in by Elle Macpherson as Schaeffer's dream girl; the role is an enigma, but Macpherson's offhand appeal and easy manner gives this fantasy figure some personality, whereas Parker is stuck in a vacuum. Ben Stiller overdoes his small part as a celebrity artist and a young Scarlett Johansson turns up as one of Schaeffer's students (looking like a pint-sized Lolita), but Schaeffer himself runs hot and cold. Wearing funny hats and talking in different rhythms, Schaeffer doesn't really overplay or underplay--he's a goofy mensch, but not a dynamic one like Albert Brooks or Woody Allen. He's careful to give his character some shading, yet the quirks--like much of the serious dialogue--are superficial. *1/2 from ****

    Eric Schaffer is excellent and so funny. I look for really big things from him. Sarah Jessica Parker is a hoot and an early Scarlett Johanson is beautiful. I'm not a big romantic comedy fan. But I love this movie. I hope it goes down as a cult classic. Ben Stiller is also a hoot as only he can be. I recommend this movie to anyone of the age to watch it. It is a great viewing pleasure for all ages old enough to see an R rated movie. Although some may call it a quirky movie, and it is, it is worth all the quirkiness it holds. It is also an independent movie and I usually don't care for those either. Even my husband enjoys this movie. It is one we watch at least once a year. It is definitely on my top ten list of favorites.

A good date movie develops characters that you could potentially like in real life and so you'd rather see them end up happy. Both leads in this suck. They're zeroes, completely lacking in value. I wanted them to jump. One other thing-when I was in college a friend of mine was an art major. Every art major had to exhibit their work openly for anyone who wanted to see. I went to my friend's show and was really surprised. Not because of how good his stuff was (it was and he's made a career of it for almost 15 years now). No, what surprised me was that his wasn't the only exhibit, and that the subject of the other exhibit was---a kid that lived in my dorm. Every picture this chick made (and I think they were all chalk) was this kid in my dorm. Just like in the movie! And when I went to make fun of him for it I couldn't because he thought it so weird and frightening he was afraid to leave his room! Just like in the movie...oh wait, she liked it. I forget that in movies obsession is an appealing quality, peeping is admired and stalking is cool. Having thought about it I think if I ever see Eric Schafer I'll have to give him a good slap.

    This movie is for those of us who are jaded and have fallen for a best friend. If you only fit one of these criteria, you probably will not enjoy the film. The film is set in New York City (and incidentally, only took five weeks to shoot...independent film and whatnot), and centers around two best friends/roommates Joe and Lucy. After Lucy dumps her boyfriend of two years due to lack of spark, Lucy reminds Joe of the "death pact" they made in college--if they both "don't have relationships with serious familial possibility" by the time Lucy turns 30, in 28 days, they would kill themselves. The rest of the film is a picture of the twenty-something dating scene and the quest for The One. Understated moments of humor speckled throughout make the plot line that could potentially be depressing make this film one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I've ever seen. I own it, I watch it often. What I don't get is the mass loathing of Eric Schaeffer. In my opinion, he is one of the most talented guys in Hollywood, and this film is more true to life than most of the other rose-colored-glasses romantic comedy trash out there, where the duologue and storyline are unrealistic and the characters are all way too good looking and self-absorbed to be believable. The only other film I have seen that comes close to this one as far as believability and realism is "The Mirror Has Two Faces". (did I just call Babs non-self-absorbed and believable? lol I think I did!) I read one comment that's bashing Mr. Schaeffer for his looks...have we all so fully bought into the media's perception of what is beautiful that we have to bash someone for not being the stereotypical romantic hero? Do we read too many romance novels that if a man doesn't look like Fabio on the cover, we automatically dismiss him as not worth our time? Ridiculous. I, for one, think Schaeffer is attractive, but it's more his personality...which in this film is quirky, yes, but also endearing and real. Fabulous performances by Schaeffer, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ben Stiller, Elle MacPherson, Dominic Chianese as the old guy in the wheelchair outside the store (can't remember his character name at the moment)...even the kids in Joe's school...and wonderful writing and direction by Schaeffer make this film a must see. Bravo!

    Platonic best friends and roommates Sarah Jessica Parker (a therapist who's bored with her clients) and Eric Schaeffer (a struggling artist who also teaches art to kids) are frustrated over their lackluster love lives and recall a pact they made years before: if they're both without partners at the age of 30, they will jump off the Brooklyn Bridge together. Romantic comedy alternates between being jaded and sentimental; it has flashes of satirical wit--but only flashes. Sarah Jessica Parker doesn't have much of a character here, and she compensates for this by doing silly bits of business (stretching, giggling, making faces). The most natural performance in the film is turned in by Elle Macpherson as Schaeffer's dream girl; the role is an enigma, but Macpherson's offhand appeal and easy manner gives this fantasy figure some personality, whereas Parker is stuck in a vacuum. Ben Stiller overdoes his small part as a celebrity artist and a young Scarlett Johansson turns up as one of Schaeffer's students (looking like a pint-sized Lolita), but Schaeffer himself runs hot and cold. Wearing funny hats and talking in different rhythms, Schaeffer doesn't really overplay or underplay--he's a goofy mensch, but not a dynamic one like Albert Brooks or Woody Allen. He's careful to give his character some shading, yet the quirks--like much of the serious dialogue--are superficial. *1/2 from ****

    Eric Schaffer is excellent and so funny. I look for really big things from him. Sarah Jessica Parker is a hoot and an early Scarlett Johanson is beautiful. I'm not a big romantic comedy fan. But I love this movie. I hope it goes down as a cult classic. Ben Stiller is also a hoot as only he can be. I recommend this movie to anyone of the age to watch it. It is a great viewing pleasure for all ages old enough to see an R rated movie. Although some may call it a quirky movie, and it is, it is worth all the quirkiness it holds. It is also an independent movie and I usually don't care for those either. Even my husband enjoys this movie. It is one we watch at least once a year. It is definitely on my top ten list of favorites.

    I can't believe some of the reviews I'm reading - so negative! I love this movie. I realize that to watch it now may leave the audience disappointed - but when it came out back in the 90's, this movie was fantastic. The script gave you just enough about the characters that you were able to draw more from their actions to see their vulnerability and insecurities. There are quite funny moments, sweet, sad and interesting. For me it was great to see these characters learn about themselves and what they wanted. I enjoyed this movie very much - and while it may not be Oscar-worthy or ground breaking, it remains one of my favorites.

    Implausible betting, especially the way the script brings it and the performers and the play make it. A few twists of the plot may attract some interest, but overall, the film is perfectly stupid, "eau de rose", despite his unrealistic disguise behind NY American artists. Some gags are trying to make us believe that nothing is serious there, but the insistence of the scenario, the traditional Disney-type music of U.S. cinema, relentlessly trying to highlight ten times with bold lines all the time any love emotion when it is supposed to be present. We feel that it addresses an audience which it does not think too much good about its ability to feel and judge for itself, or is it because if fear of misinterpretation or direction that would betray the intentions of the writer, the author. Why such a thick layer of musical peanut butter (brain?). Sarah Jessica is doing its best, obviously, but has not yet be seen out of the cart of the series B Scenario is rather confused, message stinks the scent of rosewater usual easy clich&eacute;s. Not much to be grabbed out of this, in my opinion.

    A recommendation from Portland, Maine's movie oasis, Videoport! Videoport's Matthew and I may be the only two people in Portland who genuinely a). know who writer/director/star Eric Scheffer is and b). don't think he's weird and annoying. Well, you guys just haven't gotten to know him like we have. This 1996 romantic comedy was Schaeffer's shot at mainstream success and, while that didn't work out, it's remains a refreshingly-odd and affecting antidote to bland 'romantic comedies' like The Wedding Planner, The Wedding Date, My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding or anything with Kate Hudson in it. It's weird that this didn't do better, really, as Schaeffer was savvy (or lucky) enough to have brought in Sarah Jessica Parker and Ben Stiller (right before they really took off) as support; (it's also a bummer that neither of them have reciprocated now that they pull down ten million or so a picture). In this one, Schaeffer plays Joe, Scheffer's usual snaggly, slightly spazzy goof with a soulful side who lives with his best friend Lucy (Parker, getting to act softer and goofier than usual, herself), and who pines helplessly for his unbelievably-gorgeous neighbor, the leggy Jane (played by at-the-peak-of-her-strapping-loveliness Elle MacPherson). He's a painter, she's a therapist, they're both in 29 and sadly single and Jane reminds them of a long-ago promise to kill themselves in a 'death pact' if neither of them is in a real relationship by the time they're 30. Premise! So they both agree to throw caution to the wind for the last month before jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge: Joe will finally court Jane, while Lucy will go out with anyone who asks, leading her to reluctantly accept the off-the-wall advances of famous, fatuous art phenom Bwick Elias (a funny turn by a dreadlocked Stiller). Like I said, I like Schaeffer- he's a unique comic voice and a funny guy with a serious romantic streak, and Parker and Stiller were showing more colors back then before their public personas hardened into commercial product and, if the whole 'death pact' thing doesn't quite pay off, well, it's still an unique way to get things rolling towards the predictable, yet satisfying, conclusion. Great songs by the band Marry Me Jane. Look for a young Scarlett Johansen in a small role. Also, check out Schaeffer's other films Fall, Mind the Gap, Never Again, and Wirey Spindell (sadly, his excellent first comedy My Life's In Turnaround remains out of print), and see if you'll join Matt and me in the Portland chapter of the Eric Schaeffer fan club.

    There was a brief moment in the history of cinema in the 90's when coffe shop hippies made movies. They usually consisted of a stupid idea played out over 90 minutes with a terrible deluded and quiet boring conversations. This movie is one of them. Let me start with the main 2 characters. Both are meant to be finding love and along the way find watch other. But wait you guessed it with a stupid twist along the way to keep the dopple headed crowd cheering along the way. This movies insults its viewer by making a movie around a premise which is so retarded that quiet frankly the director should have been shot. Anyway i digress. (I apolgize to the viewer not director). This movie is filled with that 90's cheese that ozzes from every frame. SJP is just awful and her chemistry with her supposed love interest is as noticeable as a fly on doo doo. Let me save you from this rant/review just do not watch this garbage. It is from an era that spawned some great movies but this was not even close to a rental!

    I am giving this movie 10 stars to compensate for the negative reviews. I am amazed at peoples reactions to this movie as it was really good. But its not surprising that the masses never know whats funny thats why they have audience laughter on TV shows to tell you when to laugh. If you don't have a brain you won't like this movie. I would rate it about an 8 or a 9. It seems Eric Schaeffer is either loved or hated. Ben Stiller is hilarious and Schaeffer's character is a bit of fresh air of seeing an American male who is not a brainwashed insensitive moron. All in all great movie I would recommend to anyone. This requires me to write 10 lines of review so I am continuing to write. Good movie.

    I saw this in the movies. I think it was the one and only time in my entire life I've fallen asleep in public. But that might have been my date. Either way, this movie was terrible. Now, I've seen it again. It wasn't just age or what was going on with my life - or who I was with. This is a terrible movie. The two lead characters who are supposed to be best friends are mean to each other and do not communicate clearly. Joe, the lead "male" and writer of the movie, dresses like a girl - complete with headband and dresses and leggings. In fact, he dresses like a little girl in the 1980's. The lead woman, played by SJP, who I can never hate, is just not likable. Nor does she make sense. One second she likes Ben Stiller's pointless character, the next she's rolling her eyes at him like the rest of us. The base story is interesting and one of my favorites, I won't spoil what that is, but suffice it to say there was plenty of potential. This movie doesn't carry it off. The editing is bad - but perhaps that's mostly the fault of a shallow script and unlikeable characters. The actors can't be faulted. They do their best with virtually no material.

    No mistake, I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did, and I gave it one star. But it's a gold star! A big bright shiny-no wait, that's a finger. Definitely one finger. A middle finger, belonging to me. A long time ago two friends of mine told me they'd just gone to see it, and I made fun of them. Mind you at the time I knew little about the movie other than it had an incredibly stupid name and that Sarah Jessica Parker still looked human. They both told me to shut up because at least I hadn't suffered the movie. Well I never felt really good about my initial response to being told they'd seen it (I literally laughed at them) so when it came on a movie channel last might I decided to check it out. I'll say that I was impressed. Not with Sarah Jessica Parker, who was moving away from pretty (Honeymoon in Vegas pretty) toward the thing from Family Stone. Nor was I impressed with Eric Shaffer (don't know if I spelled that right, don't care-he doesn't' deserve the consideration), who first wrote this horrible movie, then made it, and worst of all cast his own ugly stupid ass in the part that gets Elle Macpherson (I think I spelled that right, checked on her IMDb page and it looks good). And I wasn't impressed by Ben Stiller's moron because, while he did a fine job of playing an idiot, the character lacked any redeeming quality and came across as a prick who tried to act like an artist but who didn't understand art (like the writer/director). What impressed me was that Scarlett Johansson was pretty good at a very young age, that Elle Macpherson acted attracted to an idiot and managed to pull it off a bit and that there was someone in the movie (the old guy) who felt the same way I do about the clown who made the movie. This movie sucked about as badly as a movie can, right up until the clich&eacute; 'realize what they're looking for has been staring them in the face' ending. At that point it fell into that brown, stinky, steaming pile of filth, one of which actually IS the worst ever, the rest being serious contenders. What this movie is missing is something vital to a good date movie. The two leads make a pact to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. A good date movie develops characters that you could potentially like in real life and so you'd rather see them end up happy. Both leads in this suck. They're zeroes, completely lacking in value.

But its not surprising that the masses never know whats funny thats why they have audience laughter on TV shows to tell you when to laugh. If you don't have a brain you won't like this movie. I would rate it about an 8 or a 9. It seems Eric Schaeffer is either loved or hated. Ben Stiller is hilarious and Schaeffer's character is a bit of fresh air of seeing an American male who is not a brainwashed insensitive moron. All in all great movie I would recommend to anyone. This requires me to write 10 lines of review so I am continuing to write. Good movie.

    I saw this in the movies. I think it was the one and only time in my entire life I've fallen asleep in public. But that might have been my date. Either way, this movie was terrible. Now, I've seen it again. It wasn't just age or what was going on with my life - or who I was with. This is a terrible movie. The two lead characters who are supposed to be best friends are mean to each other and do not communicate clearly. Joe, the lead "male" and writer of the movie, dresses like a girl - complete with headband and dresses and leggings. In fact, he dresses like a little girl in the 1980's. The lead woman, played by SJP, who I can never hate, is just not likable. Nor does she make sense. One second she likes Ben Stiller's pointless character, the next she's rolling her eyes at him like the rest of us. The base story is interesting and one of my favorites, I won't spoil what that is, but suffice it to say there was plenty of potential. This movie doesn't carry it off. The editing is bad - but perhaps that's mostly the fault of a shallow script and unlikeable characters. The actors can't be faulted. They do their best with virtually no material.

    No mistake, I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did, and I gave it one star. But it's a gold star! A big bright shiny-no wait, that's a finger. Definitely one finger. A middle finger, belonging to me. A long time ago two friends of mine told me they'd just gone to see it, and I made fun of them. Mind you at the time I knew little about the movie other than it had an incredibly stupid name and that Sarah Jessica Parker still looked human. They both told me to shut up because at least I hadn't suffered the movie. Well I never felt really good about my initial response to being told they'd seen it (I literally laughed at them) so when it came on a movie channel last might I decided to check it out. I'll say that I was impressed. Not with Sarah Jessica Parker, who was moving away from pretty (Honeymoon in Vegas pretty) toward the thing from Family Stone. Nor was I impressed with Eric Shaffer (don't know if I spelled that right, don't care-he doesn't' deserve the consideration), who first wrote this horrible movie, then made it, and worst of all cast his own ugly stupid ass in the part that gets Elle Macpherson (I think I spelled that right, checked on her IMDb page and it looks good). And I wasn't impressed by Ben Stiller's moron because, while he did a fine job of playing an idiot, the character lacked any redeeming quality and came across as a prick who tried to act like an artist but who didn't understand art (like the writer/director). What impressed me was that Scarlett Johansson was pretty good at a very young age, that Elle Macpherson acted attracted to an idiot and managed to pull it off a bit and that there was someone in the movie (the old guy) who felt the same way I do about the clown who made the movie. This movie sucked about as badly as a movie can, right up until the clich&eacute; 'realize what they're looking for has been staring them in the face' ending. At that point it fell into that brown, stinky, steaming pile of filth, one of which actually IS the worst ever, the rest being serious contenders. What this movie is missing is something vital to a good date movie. The two leads make a pact to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. A good date movie develops characters that you could potentially like in real life and so you'd rather see them end up happy. Both leads in this suck. They're zeroes, completely lacking in value. I wanted them to jump. One other thing-when I was in college a friend of mine was an art major. Every art major had to exhibit their work openly for anyone who wanted to see. I went to my friend's show and was really surprised. Not because of how good his stuff was (it was and he's made a career of it for almost 15 years now). No, what surprised me was that his wasn't the only exhibit, and that the subject of the other exhibit was---a kid that lived in my dorm. Every picture this chick made (and I think they were all chalk) was this kid in my dorm. Just like in the movie! And when I went to make fun of him for it I couldn't because he thought it so weird and frightening he was afraid to leave his room! Just like in the movie...oh wait, she liked it. I forget that in movies obsession is an appealing quality, peeping is admired and stalking is cool. Having thought about it I think if I ever see Eric Schafer I'll have to give him a good slap.

    This movie is for those of us who are jaded and have fallen for a best friend. If you only fit one of these criteria, you probably will not enjoy the film. The film is set in New York City (and incidentally, only took five weeks to shoot...independent film and whatnot), and centers around two best friends/roommates Joe and Lucy. After Lucy dumps her boyfriend of two years due to lack of spark, Lucy reminds Joe of the "death pact" they made in college--if they both "don't have relationships with serious familial possibility" by the time Lucy turns 30, in 28 days, they would kill themselves. The rest of the film is a picture of the twenty-something dating scene and the quest for The One. Understated moments of humor speckled throughout make the plot line that could potentially be depressing make this film one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I've ever seen. I own it, I watch it often. What I don't get is the mass loathing of Eric Schaeffer. In my opinion, he is one of the most talented guys in Hollywood, and this film is more true to life than most of the other rose-colored-glasses romantic comedy trash out there, where the duologue and storyline are unrealistic and the characters are all way too good looking and self-absorbed to be believable. The only other film I have seen that comes close to this one as far as believability and realism is "The Mirror Has Two Faces". (did I just call Babs non-self-absorbed and believable? lol I think I did!) I read one comment that's bashing Mr. Schaeffer for his looks...have we all so fully bought into the media's perception of what is beautiful that we have to bash someone for not being the stereotypical romantic hero? Do we read too many romance novels that if a man doesn't look like Fabio on the cover, we automatically dismiss him as not worth our time? Ridiculous. I, for one, think Schaeffer is attractive, but it's more his personality...which in this film is quirky, yes, but also endearing and real. Fabulous performances by Schaeffer, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ben Stiller, Elle MacPherson, Dominic Chianese as the old guy in the wheelchair outside the store (can't remember his character name at the moment)...even the kids in Joe's school...and wonderful writing and direction by Schaeffer make this film a must see. Bravo!

    Platonic best friends and roommates Sarah Jessica Parker (a therapist who's bored with her clients) and Eric Schaeffer (a struggling artist who also teaches art to kids) are frustrated over their lackluster love lives and recall a pact they made years before: if they're both without partners at the age of 30, they will jump off the Brooklyn Bridge together. Romantic comedy alternates between being jaded and sentimental; it has flashes of satirical wit--but only flashes. Sarah Jessica Parker doesn't have much of a character here, and she compensates for this by doing silly bits of business (stretching, giggling, making faces). The most natural performance in the film is turned in by Elle Macpherson as Schaeffer's dream girl; the role is an enigma, but Macpherson's offhand appeal and easy manner gives this fantasy figure some personality, whereas Parker is stuck in a vacuum. Ben Stiller overdoes his small part as a celebrity artist and a young Scarlett Johansson turns up as one of Schaeffer's students (looking like a pint-sized Lolita), but Schaeffer himself runs hot and cold. Wearing funny hats and talking in different rhythms, Schaeffer doesn't really overplay or underplay--he's a goofy mensch, but not a dynamic one like Albert Brooks or Woody Allen. He's careful to give his character some shading, yet the quirks--like much of the serious dialogue--are superficial. *1/2 from ****

    Eric Schaffer is excellent and so funny. I look for really big things from him. Sarah Jessica Parker is a hoot and an early Scarlett Johanson is beautiful. I'm not a big romantic comedy fan. But I love this movie. I hope it goes down as a cult classic. Ben Stiller is also a hoot as only he can be. I recommend this movie to anyone of the age to watch it. It is a great viewing pleasure for all ages old enough to see an R rated movie. Although some may call it a quirky movie, and it is, it is worth all the quirkiness it holds. It is also an independent movie and I usually don't care for those either. Even my husband enjoys this movie. It is one we watch at least once a year. It is definitely on my top ten list of favorites.

    I can't believe some of the reviews I'm reading - so negative! I love this movie. I realize that to watch it now may leave the audience disappointed - but when it came out back in the 90's, this movie was fantastic. The script gave you just enough about the characters that you were able to draw more from their actions to see their vulnerability and insecurities. There are quite funny moments, sweet, sad and interesting. For me it was great to see these characters learn about themselves and what they wanted. I enjoyed this movie very much - and while it may not be Oscar-worthy or ground breaking, it remains one of my favorites.

    Implausible betting, especially the way the script brings it and the performers and the play make it. A few twists of the plot may attract some interest, but overall, the film is perfectly stupid, "eau de rose", despite his unrealistic disguise behind NY American artists. Some gags are trying to make us believe that nothing is serious there, but the insistence of the scenario, the traditional Disney-type music of U.S. cinema, relentlessly trying to highlight ten times with bold lines all the time any love emotion when it is supposed to be present. We feel that it addresses an audience which it does not think too much good about its ability to feel and judge for itself, or is it because if fear of misinterpretation or direction that would betray the intentions of the writer, the author. Why such a thick layer of musical peanut butter (brain?). Sarah Jessica is doing its best, obviously, but has not yet be seen out of the cart of the series B Scenario is rather confused, message stinks the scent of rosewater usual easy clich&eacute;s. Not much to be grabbed out of this, in my opinion.

    A recommendation from Portland, Maine's movie oasis, Videoport! Videoport's Matthew and I may be the only two people in Portland who genuinely a). know who writer/director/star Eric Scheffer is and b). don't think he's weird and annoying. Well, you guys just haven't gotten to know him like we have. This 1996 romantic comedy was Schaeffer's shot at mainstream success and, while that didn't work out, it's remains a refreshingly-odd and affecting antidote to bland 'romantic comedies' like The Wedding Planner, The Wedding Date, My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding or anything with Kate Hudson in it. It's weird that this didn't do better, really, as Schaeffer was savvy (or lucky) enough to have brought in Sarah Jessica Parker and Ben Stiller (right before they really took off) as support; (it's also a bummer that neither of them have reciprocated now that they pull down ten million or so a picture). In this one, Schaeffer plays Joe, Scheffer's usual snaggly, slightly spazzy goof with a soulful side who lives with his best friend Lucy (Parker, getting to act softer and goofier than usual, herself), and who pines helplessly for his unbelievably-gorgeous neighbor, the leggy Jane (played by at-the-peak-of-her-strapping-loveliness Elle MacPherson). He's a painter, she's a therapist, they're both in 29 and sadly single and Jane reminds them of a long-ago promise to kill themselves in a 'death pact' if neither of them is in a real relationship by the time they're 30. Premise! So they both agree to throw caution to the wind for the last month before jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge: Joe will finally court Jane, while Lucy will go out with anyone who asks, leading her to reluctantly accept the off-the-wall advances of famous, fatuous art phenom Bwick Elias (a funny turn by a dreadlocked Stiller). Like I said, I like Schaeffer- he's a unique comic voice and a funny guy with a serious romantic streak, and Parker and Stiller were showing more colors back then before their public personas hardened into commercial product and, if the whole 'death pact' thing doesn't quite pay off, well, it's still an unique way to get things rolling towards the predictable, yet satisfying, conclusion. Great songs by the band Marry Me Jane. Look for a young Scarlett Johansen in a small role. Also, check out Schaeffer's other films Fall, Mind the Gap, Never Again, and Wirey Spindell (sadly, his excellent first comedy My Life's In Turnaround remains out of print), and see if you'll join Matt and me in the Portland chapter of the Eric Schaeffer fan club.

    There was a brief moment in the history of cinema in the 90's when coffe shop hippies made movies. They usually consisted of a stupid idea played out over 90 minutes with a terrible deluded and quiet boring conversations. This movie is one of them. Let me start with the main 2 characters. Both are meant to be finding love and along the way find watch other. But wait you guessed it with a stupid twist along the way to keep the dopple headed crowd cheering along the way. This movies insults its viewer by making a movie around a premise which is so retarded that quiet frankly the director should have been shot. Anyway i digress. (I apolgize to the viewer not director). This movie is filled with that 90's cheese that ozzes from every frame. SJP is just awful and her chemistry with her supposed love interest is as noticeable as a fly on doo doo. Let me save you from this rant/review just do not watch this garbage. It is from an era that spawned some great movies but this was not even close to a rental!
