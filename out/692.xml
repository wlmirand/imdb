 <sinopse>
  Comedy-drama about a widowed US president and a lobbyist who fall in love. It's all aboveboard, but "politics is perception" and sparks fly anyway.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Andrew Shepherd is approaching the end of his first term as President of the United States. He's a widower with a young daughter and has proved to be popular with the public. His election seems assured. That is until he meets Sydney Ellen Wade, a paid political activist working for an environmental lobby group. He's immediately smitten with her and after several amusing attempts, they finally manage to go on a date (which happens to be a State dinner for the visiting President of France). His relationship with Wade opens the door for his prime political opponent, Senator Bob Rumson, to launch an attack on the President's character, something he could not do in the previous election as Shepherd's wife had only recently died.

    The American President (1995) What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don't usually go together). What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn't a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It's funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It's acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth. It's almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via "West Wing") he later becomes the president. But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, "Love Actually," with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind. In fact, I'm going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn't really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it's easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He's confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah. And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness. Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it's not only about politics. In fact it's a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out. Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as "Meathead") in "All in the Family." It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don't stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one. But here we have "The American President," deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours. I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.

    Many people are viewed as cynical or snobs because they can't enjoy a nice little rom-com or a modern fairy-tale like "Maid in Manhattan" or "Love Actually", but that's only because there are far superior films. "The American President" is one of them. "This is my first time at the White House. I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality" says Annette Bening to a guard, with a childish and communicative enthusiasm. In no doubt, this is the screenwriter's recognition of the spirit that guided him when he wrote the delightful romantic comedy "The American President". Aaron Sorkin, last year's winner for "The Social Network" indeed insufflates a "Capra-esque quality" with a modern sauce to make the film an absolute delight. I can't believe the film got only one nomination for Best Original Score, and nothing for the Screenplay, for Rob Reiner's confident directing, or the art-design, considering its meticulous attention to recreate the Presidential environment. I'm not the greatest fan of romantic comedies, but when it reaches such a level of greatness, I think it should be dignified with a more Academic recognition. Take Annette Benign as Sydney, the environmentalist who conquers the President's heart, yes she's not playing a tormented character but within the range of emotions required for her role, she's perfect. She's cute, witty, with the mimics of a little girl, but also manages to be sensual and absolutely intimidating. She never even falls in the typical "hard-to-get clich&eacute;", because she obviously is also attracted to Shepherd. On the other side, Andrew Shepherd, the titular president is charismatic, ultra-popular, but his specificity relies on his marital status, or as a matter of fact, its absence since he's a widower. Yet he immediately falls in love with Sydney, amazed by her striking good looks and intrigued by her exuberant yet indubitably brilliant personality. We believe that both characters fall in love so quick because they're genuinely appealing. And Shepherd's struggles to seduce Sydney, from the flowers to his own daughter's advice, conveys the state of mind of a man who's totally in love and in the meanwhile provides some of the film's best gags. I could have seen George Clooney playing Shepherd's role if the film was made today, but I doubt he'd pull off as much vulnerability and innocent enthusiasm as Douglas did. Douglas literally plays three characters, there's the President within his own staff and entourage, there's Andy the private man, and there's the President as a 'character' for the Press, the public and the Opposition. And it's thrilling that we never really know when he stops being President and when he becomes Andrew Shepherd or Andy, because Douglas carries this presidential aura like both a prestige and a handicap. For instance, he can date Sidney because no one can't say 'no' to the President', but he's still got to seduce her. He's the most powerful man in the world, but one can be wrong to believe it applies to every situation, especially the most intimate ones. The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media. Crime control, environment, lobbyism, pre-election campaign, and the notion of 'character', this idea that the character count more than actions, says a lot about the vision of politics conveyed by the script, not so far from Capra's visions by the way. Andy even believed that "If there had been a TV in every living room sixty years ago, this country wouldn't have elected a man in a wheelchair." Flirting with a witty cynicism, the film insists on the importance of appearances and illusions in a media-centric society, but it's only legitimate as long as it's not used to twist the truth. Beyond the comedic aspect, there's more depth in Douglas' character as a man who wants to act according to his beliefs and emotions, and not because he wants to please the crowd, not when it involves his privacy anyway, yet he's still stuck in his position as a President who has to answer to the Americans. In one poignant key-scene with A.J. Mackeray, his Chief of Staff and best friend, remarkably played by Martin Sheen, Andrew questions his own popularity and wonders if in a way; the cancer that took his wife away didn't pave his road to the White House by cementing a public empathy and make him relatively untouchable by the Opposition. The script is clever enough to let us judge by ourselves, Mackeray 'doesn't know" but through the film, it's obvious that the romance with Sidney doesn't serve his political ambitions and plays the reverse role than his status as a widower. His own Press Secretary clumsily admits "We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower." But nonetheless, Shepherd is appealing because he doesn't want to be 'an image' and it's this very integrity that hit a sensitive chord in Sydney, she doesn't fall in love just because he is what he is. The chemistry between the lead cuts straight to our hearts because of the solid characterization solid and top-notch writing, this is an adult and intelligent film. One of the best comedies of the 90's, "The American President" is also served by an impeccable gallery of supporting performances, from Richard Dreyfus as the Republican opponent Bob Rumson to Michael J. Fox, who steals the scene as Lewis, the Domestic Policy adviser. Fox gives such an electrifying performance that I wish he had more screen-time, his performance could have been Oscar-material. (All that said "The American President" is a flawless film, with maybe one little unforgivable mistake: with all the attention paid to little details in order to create an authentic feeling, they could have afforded a Native French speaker to play the French President.)

    Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely "clued in", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.

    It should have been apparent when "Written by Aaron Sorkin" appeared on the screen, but government is only a tool in this film. Sorkin uses it with his usual degree of shrewdness, but political concerns are nothing more than an impetus - a joke. THE American PRESIDENT focuses on the most powerful man on the planet. To what is his power relegated? Jokes. Examining the film reveals that most references to political topics are implemented as gags. Shepherd's position of power is a running line, joined by federal disasters, Tel Aviv hostility, assassination, corruption, and dead Japanese leaders, only to name a few. These references are often planted into the script as irony, encouraging the audience to feel that the President deals with Middle Eastern militants like we do the dishes. The larger point of this is also tied to the remarkable success of the film. Sorkin knows every trick in the book and he is shamelessly employing them. Reiners directing is completely unremarkable, but it would be impossible to fail with this script. Why do the conservatives look bad? Because they care about family values. THE American PRESIDENT is the pinnacle of Hollywood Liberalism, or "safe" liberalism. Shepherd is: the same as most people and entirely different from most people. The jokes and the sweetness all bank on Shepherd appearing as one of us. But he's not. The worst things people can do in this film are prioritize something that conflicts with a man who seems not to conflict with anything. THE American PRESIDENT, while being a terribly successful Rom-Com, teaches us something interesting about how Hollywood operates. This movie could hardly anger anyone. And that is precisely because of the script's perpetuation of contradiction and fantasy. The less political, the better. Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen both deliver knockout performances that manage to become something more than Sorkin's mouth. 62.0000

    US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy. Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist. Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency. This is not exactly a political thriller. In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine. However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing. However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing. Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well. Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or "oil baron" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

    Extraordinary movie about an extraordinary president. I would vote for Andrew Shepherd right now if I had the chance. The writers did a fantastic job of portraying the game of politics, the intricacies of a blossoming new relationship, and the balance between the two. Douglas was phenomenal in this role, as was Annette Benning. I came away from it feeling energized in several ways. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I would even recommend that it be shown in civics courses in high school and college - not for the love story, which I really felt was secondary to the story about the workings of government. Although, make no mistakes about it, the love story was just as fantastic!

    The American President is the wildest wish-fulfilment: the presentation to Congress of a bill to cut C02 emissions by 20 per cent in the next 10 years. Unheard of then, and certainly unheard of now. It made the President's love affair in this movie, and it would have promised to change the direction of the USA in 1995. However, in 2008, after General Motors went bust, America bought the company and it went back into business with bigger cars, all of them gas-guzzlers. Far from resembling anything in The American President, it has been downhill all the way. Now the USA wants all of Canada's evil tar sands for itself and is fielding "environmentalists" to stop it being shipped to China. Rob Reiner made a very decent, upbeat movie, that showed great promise for the Republic in the right hands. Sadly, it has now become a relic of a former era. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the lift it gave me and I recommend it to others.

    A beautifully crafted film that works on every level. It gives you great insight into American politics, particularly re-election but politics is just one thread woven through this superb tapestry of a tale. The romance is beautifully crafted, with just the right amounts of humour, nervousness and sensuality. The supporting cast are well served by a sparkling script; Sheen, Fox and Waldren get some great one liners And just wait for the quality and majesty of Andrew Shepherd's press conference at towards the end of the film

    This movie appeared before the American president as a hero movies (ID4 and Airforce One) but it still a very pro-American president movie. At the time of this movie, there was no hint of disgrace within the Presidency. It was late 1997, 1998 that the whole Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones affairs hit the media. Nixon and the affairs of Watergate are far behind us so the president was somebody to look up to and admire. Somebody to follow and worship and a position to aspire to. What surprised me about this movie though is that it made the President a normal person. President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a single president, actually a widower. His wife died during his election campaign and this was used successfully to elect him to office. He did not use it because Andrew Shepherd is portrayed as an honest president who loved his wife dearly, but the events that transpired severely hindered the opposition. One day, while debating a bill, an environmental lobbyist decided to speak her mind to the president and this impressed him. He is surrounded by people calling him sir and Mr President: even his best friend refuses to treat him as an equal, and thus he is lonely. He is not a megalomaniac, but rather a president that wants the best for people. He is one that wants to serve the people and not be considered to be too important to talk to normal people. Unfortunately, as president, he cannot escape this. A normal walk down the White House brings marine soldiers saluting him, and he cannot go anywhere without the press following him. He cannot even have a private relationship without the press plastering it all over the papers and the opposition using it against him. The movie is not about the President trying to get this girl, he has her right from the beginning. Rather it deals with the pressures of public life and the problems that they put on the relationship. The real struggles come from the guilt that his girlfriend (Annette Bening) has in regards to the president's daughter, and the fact that people will accuse her of manipulating the president. The greater problem, the one the movie is focused around, it the president struggling with the nature of his private life. He refuses to bring his relationship into the open, nor to defend it, while his opponent is constantly attacking it by dragging up the past. One theme that came through this movie is the realisation of the problems of being president. The major one is the publicity of his private life. The press follows him everywhere and everybody knows what he did with his girlfriend. The first time she spent the night over there, everybody in America knew. Thus I think this movie is an attack against the publicity of some of these lives. It depends on the person  some like to have their lives publicised, while others just can't escape from the press. Generally people do not like the press questioning their activities, especially when they are illegal. In this movie, it is not illegal, but rather private. The American President is a comedy though, but most of the comedy is focused around reactions of normal people to the American President. He has a habit of going out to the people and meeting them face to face. In this movie we laugh at the thing people do when they are nervous, especially when the President rings up. We laugh even more at the way people grovel to him, and their disbelief in the fact that he is personally calling them. This movie forces us to accept the president as a normal person, somebody who loves, hates, and does everything else that we do.

    Out of the 42 individuals who have become presidents two of them, John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson, had wives who died while they were in the White House and who courted and married women who became the second first ladies in their respective administrations. Both Julia Gardiner Tyler and Edith Bolling Galt Wilson were each remarkable first ladies in their own ways and Mrs. Wilson did become a minor issue in her husband's bid for a second term. But none ever engendered the controversy shown here by President Michael Douglas's courtship of Annette Bening. The fictional Douglas is a widower like Tyler and Wilson and he meets and falls hard for an environmental lobbyist. When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition. The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film. I actually think that Aaron Sorkin might have gotten some inspiration for The American President from Nebraska where back a few years earlier Governor Robert Kerrey was involved with actress Debra Winger. I still remember a certain New York Post columnist named Ray Kerrison getting all kinds of hot and bothered when Winger spent a night in the Governor's mansion in Lincoln, Nebraska the same way Dreyfuss is doing here. What bothered him the most is that no one seemed to care about the horrible moral transgressions being committed in the Governor's mansion. Michael Sheen who would become an American President on a TV series created by Aaron Sorkin and Michael J. Fox are Douglas's two chief staff aides. Shawna Waldron has a nice performance as the President's daughter and she comes over like a real kid and a very unspoiled one at that considering where she's living. The American President is a class and classy drama and you only wish more presidents would act like Douglas and Sheen in their respective fictional presidencies.

Douglas literally plays three characters, there's the President within his own staff and entourage, there's Andy the private man, and there's the President as a 'character' for the Press, the public and the Opposition. And it's thrilling that we never really know when he stops being President and when he becomes Andrew Shepherd or Andy, because Douglas carries this presidential aura like both a prestige and a handicap. For instance, he can date Sidney because no one can't say 'no' to the President', but he's still got to seduce her. He's the most powerful man in the world, but one can be wrong to believe it applies to every situation, especially the most intimate ones. The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media. Crime control, environment, lobbyism, pre-election campaign, and the notion of 'character', this idea that the character count more than actions, says a lot about the vision of politics conveyed by the script, not so far from Capra's visions by the way. Andy even believed that "If there had been a TV in every living room sixty years ago, this country wouldn't have elected a man in a wheelchair." Flirting with a witty cynicism, the film insists on the importance of appearances and illusions in a media-centric society, but it's only legitimate as long as it's not used to twist the truth. Beyond the comedic aspect, there's more depth in Douglas' character as a man who wants to act according to his beliefs and emotions, and not because he wants to please the crowd, not when it involves his privacy anyway, yet he's still stuck in his position as a President who has to answer to the Americans. In one poignant key-scene with A.J. Mackeray, his Chief of Staff and best friend, remarkably played by Martin Sheen, Andrew questions his own popularity and wonders if in a way; the cancer that took his wife away didn't pave his road to the White House by cementing a public empathy and make him relatively untouchable by the Opposition. The script is clever enough to let us judge by ourselves, Mackeray 'doesn't know" but through the film, it's obvious that the romance with Sidney doesn't serve his political ambitions and plays the reverse role than his status as a widower. His own Press Secretary clumsily admits "We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower." But nonetheless, Shepherd is appealing because he doesn't want to be 'an image' and it's this very integrity that hit a sensitive chord in Sydney, she doesn't fall in love just because he is what he is. The chemistry between the lead cuts straight to our hearts because of the solid characterization solid and top-notch writing, this is an adult and intelligent film. One of the best comedies of the 90's, "The American President" is also served by an impeccable gallery of supporting performances, from Richard Dreyfus as the Republican opponent Bob Rumson to Michael J. Fox, who steals the scene as Lewis, the Domestic Policy adviser. Fox gives such an electrifying performance that I wish he had more screen-time, his performance could have been Oscar-material. (All that said "The American President" is a flawless film, with maybe one little unforgivable mistake: with all the attention paid to little details in order to create an authentic feeling, they could have afforded a Native French speaker to play the French President.)

    Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely "clued in", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.

    It should have been apparent when "Written by Aaron Sorkin" appeared on the screen, but government is only a tool in this film. Sorkin uses it with his usual degree of shrewdness, but political concerns are nothing more than an impetus - a joke. THE American PRESIDENT focuses on the most powerful man on the planet. To what is his power relegated? Jokes. Examining the film reveals that most references to political topics are implemented as gags. Shepherd's position of power is a running line, joined by federal disasters, Tel Aviv hostility, assassination, corruption, and dead Japanese leaders, only to name a few. These references are often planted into the script as irony, encouraging the audience to feel that the President deals with Middle Eastern militants like we do the dishes. The larger point of this is also tied to the remarkable success of the film. Sorkin knows every trick in the book and he is shamelessly employing them. Reiners directing is completely unremarkable, but it would be impossible to fail with this script. Why do the conservatives look bad? Because they care about family values. THE American PRESIDENT is the pinnacle of Hollywood Liberalism, or "safe" liberalism. Shepherd is: the same as most people and entirely different from most people. The jokes and the sweetness all bank on Shepherd appearing as one of us. But he's not. The worst things people can do in this film are prioritize something that conflicts with a man who seems not to conflict with anything. THE American PRESIDENT, while being a terribly successful Rom-Com, teaches us something interesting about how Hollywood operates. This movie could hardly anger anyone. And that is precisely because of the script's perpetuation of contradiction and fantasy. The less political, the better. Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen both deliver knockout performances that manage to become something more than Sorkin's mouth. 62.0000

    US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy. Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist. Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency. This is not exactly a political thriller. In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine. However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing. However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing. Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well. Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or "oil baron" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

    Extraordinary movie about an extraordinary president. I would vote for Andrew Shepherd right now if I had the chance. The writers did a fantastic job of portraying the game of politics, the intricacies of a blossoming new relationship, and the balance between the two. Douglas was phenomenal in this role, as was Annette Benning. I came away from it feeling energized in several ways. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I would even recommend that it be shown in civics courses in high school and college - not for the love story, which I really felt was secondary to the story about the workings of government. Although, make no mistakes about it, the love story was just as fantastic!

    The American President is the wildest wish-fulfilment: the presentation to Congress of a bill to cut C02 emissions by 20 per cent in the next 10 years. Unheard of then, and certainly unheard of now. It made the President's love affair in this movie, and it would have promised to change the direction of the USA in 1995. However, in 2008, after General Motors went bust, America bought the company and it went back into business with bigger cars, all of them gas-guzzlers. Far from resembling anything in The American President, it has been downhill all the way. Now the USA wants all of Canada's evil tar sands for itself and is fielding "environmentalists" to stop it being shipped to China. Rob Reiner made a very decent, upbeat movie, that showed great promise for the Republic in the right hands. Sadly, it has now become a relic of a former era. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the lift it gave me and I recommend it to others.

    A beautifully crafted film that works on every level. It gives you great insight into American politics, particularly re-election but politics is just one thread woven through this superb tapestry of a tale. The romance is beautifully crafted, with just the right amounts of humour, nervousness and sensuality. The supporting cast are well served by a sparkling script; Sheen, Fox and Waldren get some great one liners And just wait for the quality and majesty of Andrew Shepherd's press conference at towards the end of the film

    This movie appeared before the American president as a hero movies (ID4 and Airforce One) but it still a very pro-American president movie. At the time of this movie, there was no hint of disgrace within the Presidency. It was late 1997, 1998 that the whole Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones affairs hit the media. Nixon and the affairs of Watergate are far behind us so the president was somebody to look up to and admire. Somebody to follow and worship and a position to aspire to. What surprised me about this movie though is that it made the President a normal person. President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a single president, actually a widower. His wife died during his election campaign and this was used successfully to elect him to office. He did not use it because Andrew Shepherd is portrayed as an honest president who loved his wife dearly, but the events that transpired severely hindered the opposition. One day, while debating a bill, an environmental lobbyist decided to speak her mind to the president and this impressed him. He is surrounded by people calling him sir and Mr President: even his best friend refuses to treat him as an equal, and thus he is lonely. He is not a megalomaniac, but rather a president that wants the best for people. He is one that wants to serve the people and not be considered to be too important to talk to normal people. Unfortunately, as president, he cannot escape this. A normal walk down the White House brings marine soldiers saluting him, and he cannot go anywhere without the press following him. He cannot even have a private relationship without the press plastering it all over the papers and the opposition using it against him. The movie is not about the President trying to get this girl, he has her right from the beginning. Rather it deals with the pressures of public life and the problems that they put on the relationship. The real struggles come from the guilt that his girlfriend (Annette Bening) has in regards to the president's daughter, and the fact that people will accuse her of manipulating the president. The greater problem, the one the movie is focused around, it the president struggling with the nature of his private life. He refuses to bring his relationship into the open, nor to defend it, while his opponent is constantly attacking it by dragging up the past. One theme that came through this movie is the realisation of the problems of being president. The major one is the publicity of his private life. The press follows him everywhere and everybody knows what he did with his girlfriend. The first time she spent the night over there, everybody in America knew. Thus I think this movie is an attack against the publicity of some of these lives. It depends on the person  some like to have their lives publicised, while others just can't escape from the press. Generally people do not like the press questioning their activities, especially when they are illegal. In this movie, it is not illegal, but rather private. The American President is a comedy though, but most of the comedy is focused around reactions of normal people to the American President. He has a habit of going out to the people and meeting them face to face. In this movie we laugh at the thing people do when they are nervous, especially when the President rings up. We laugh even more at the way people grovel to him, and their disbelief in the fact that he is personally calling them. This movie forces us to accept the president as a normal person, somebody who loves, hates, and does everything else that we do.

    Out of the 42 individuals who have become presidents two of them, John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson, had wives who died while they were in the White House and who courted and married women who became the second first ladies in their respective administrations. Both Julia Gardiner Tyler and Edith Bolling Galt Wilson were each remarkable first ladies in their own ways and Mrs. Wilson did become a minor issue in her husband's bid for a second term. But none ever engendered the controversy shown here by President Michael Douglas's courtship of Annette Bening. The fictional Douglas is a widower like Tyler and Wilson and he meets and falls hard for an environmental lobbyist. When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition. The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film. I actually think that Aaron Sorkin might have gotten some inspiration for The American President from Nebraska where back a few years earlier Governor Robert Kerrey was involved with actress Debra Winger. I still remember a certain New York Post columnist named Ray Kerrison getting all kinds of hot and bothered when Winger spent a night in the Governor's mansion in Lincoln, Nebraska the same way Dreyfuss is doing here. What bothered him the most is that no one seemed to care about the horrible moral transgressions being committed in the Governor's mansion. Michael Sheen who would become an American President on a TV series created by Aaron Sorkin and Michael J. Fox are Douglas's two chief staff aides. Shawna Waldron has a nice performance as the President's daughter and she comes over like a real kid and a very unspoiled one at that considering where she's living. The American President is a class and classy drama and you only wish more presidents would act like Douglas and Sheen in their respective fictional presidencies.

    The American President (1995) What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don't usually go together). What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn't a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It's funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It's acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth. It's almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via "West Wing") he later becomes the president. But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, "Love Actually," with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind. In fact, I'm going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn't really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it's easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He's confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah. And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness. Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it's not only about politics. In fact it's a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out. Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as "Meathead") in "All in the Family." It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don't stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one. But here we have "The American President," deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours. I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.

    Many people are viewed as cynical or snobs because they can't enjoy a nice little rom-com or a modern fairy-tale like "Maid in Manhattan" or "Love Actually", but that's only because there are far superior films. "The American President" is one of them. "This is my first time at the White House. I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality" says Annette Bening to a guard, with a childish and communicative enthusiasm. In no doubt, this is the screenwriter's recognition of the spirit that guided him when he wrote the delightful romantic comedy "The American President". Aaron Sorkin, last year's winner for "The Social Network" indeed insufflates a "Capra-esque quality" with a modern sauce to make the film an absolute delight. I can't believe the film got only one nomination for Best Original Score, and nothing for the Screenplay, for Rob Reiner's confident directing, or the art-design, considering its meticulous attention to recreate the Presidential environment. I'm not the greatest fan of romantic comedies, but when it reaches such a level of greatness, I think it should be dignified with a more Academic recognition. Take Annette Benign as Sydney, the environmentalist who conquers the President's heart, yes she's not playing a tormented character but within the range of emotions required for her role, she's perfect. She's cute, witty, with the mimics of a little girl, but also manages to be sensual and absolutely intimidating. She never even falls in the typical "hard-to-get clich&eacute;", because she obviously is also attracted to Shepherd. On the other side, Andrew Shepherd, the titular president is charismatic, ultra-popular, but his specificity relies on his marital status, or as a matter of fact, its absence since he's a widower. Yet he immediately falls in love with Sydney, amazed by her striking good looks and intrigued by her exuberant yet indubitably brilliant personality. We believe that both characters fall in love so quick because they're genuinely appealing. And Shepherd's struggles to seduce Sydney, from the flowers to his own daughter's advice, conveys the state of mind of a man who's totally in love and in the meanwhile provides some of the film's best gags. I could have seen George Clooney playing Shepherd's role if the film was made today, but I doubt he'd pull off as much vulnerability and innocent enthusiasm as Douglas did. Douglas literally plays three characters, there's the President within his own staff and entourage, there's Andy the private man, and there's the President as a 'character' for the Press, the public and the Opposition. And it's thrilling that we never really know when he stops being President and when he becomes Andrew Shepherd or Andy, because Douglas carries this presidential aura like both a prestige and a handicap. For instance, he can date Sidney because no one can't say 'no' to the President', but he's still got to seduce her. He's the most powerful man in the world, but one can be wrong to believe it applies to every situation, especially the most intimate ones. The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media.

Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or "oil baron" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

    Extraordinary movie about an extraordinary president. I would vote for Andrew Shepherd right now if I had the chance. The writers did a fantastic job of portraying the game of politics, the intricacies of a blossoming new relationship, and the balance between the two. Douglas was phenomenal in this role, as was Annette Benning. I came away from it feeling energized in several ways. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I would even recommend that it be shown in civics courses in high school and college - not for the love story, which I really felt was secondary to the story about the workings of government. Although, make no mistakes about it, the love story was just as fantastic!

    The American President is the wildest wish-fulfilment: the presentation to Congress of a bill to cut C02 emissions by 20 per cent in the next 10 years. Unheard of then, and certainly unheard of now. It made the President's love affair in this movie, and it would have promised to change the direction of the USA in 1995. However, in 2008, after General Motors went bust, America bought the company and it went back into business with bigger cars, all of them gas-guzzlers. Far from resembling anything in The American President, it has been downhill all the way. Now the USA wants all of Canada's evil tar sands for itself and is fielding "environmentalists" to stop it being shipped to China. Rob Reiner made a very decent, upbeat movie, that showed great promise for the Republic in the right hands. Sadly, it has now become a relic of a former era. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the lift it gave me and I recommend it to others.

    This movie appeared before the American president as a hero movies (ID4 and Airforce One) but it still a very pro-American president movie. At the time of this movie, there was no hint of disgrace within the Presidency. It was late 1997, 1998 that the whole Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones affairs hit the media. Nixon and the affairs of Watergate are far behind us so the president was somebody to look up to and admire. Somebody to follow and worship and a position to aspire to. What surprised me about this movie though is that it made the President a normal person. President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a single president, actually a widower. His wife died during his election campaign and this was used successfully to elect him to office. He did not use it because Andrew Shepherd is portrayed as an honest president who loved his wife dearly, but the events that transpired severely hindered the opposition. One day, while debating a bill, an environmental lobbyist decided to speak her mind to the president and this impressed him. He is surrounded by people calling him sir and Mr President: even his best friend refuses to treat him as an equal, and thus he is lonely. He is not a megalomaniac, but rather a president that wants the best for people. He is one that wants to serve the people and not be considered to be too important to talk to normal people. Unfortunately, as president, he cannot escape this. A normal walk down the White House brings marine soldiers saluting him, and he cannot go anywhere without the press following him. He cannot even have a private relationship without the press plastering it all over the papers and the opposition using it against him. The movie is not about the President trying to get this girl, he has her right from the beginning. Rather it deals with the pressures of public life and the problems that they put on the relationship. The real struggles come from the guilt that his girlfriend (Annette Bening) has in regards to the president's daughter, and the fact that people will accuse her of manipulating the president. The greater problem, the one the movie is focused around, it the president struggling with the nature of his private life. He refuses to bring his relationship into the open, nor to defend it, while his opponent is constantly attacking it by dragging up the past. One theme that came through this movie is the realisation of the problems of being president. The major one is the publicity of his private life. The press follows him everywhere and everybody knows what he did with his girlfriend. The first time she spent the night over there, everybody in America knew. Thus I think this movie is an attack against the publicity of some of these lives. It depends on the person  some like to have their lives publicised, while others just can't escape from the press. Generally people do not like the press questioning their activities, especially when they are illegal. In this movie, it is not illegal, but rather private. The American President is a comedy though, but most of the comedy is focused around reactions of normal people to the American President. He has a habit of going out to the people and meeting them face to face. In this movie we laugh at the thing people do when they are nervous, especially when the President rings up. We laugh even more at the way people grovel to him, and their disbelief in the fact that he is personally calling them. This movie forces us to accept the president as a normal person, somebody who loves, hates, and does everything else that we do.

    Out of the 42 individuals who have become presidents two of them, John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson, had wives who died while they were in the White House and who courted and married women who became the second first ladies in their respective administrations. Both Julia Gardiner Tyler and Edith Bolling Galt Wilson were each remarkable first ladies in their own ways and Mrs. Wilson did become a minor issue in her husband's bid for a second term. But none ever engendered the controversy shown here by President Michael Douglas's courtship of Annette Bening. The fictional Douglas is a widower like Tyler and Wilson and he meets and falls hard for an environmental lobbyist. When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition. The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film. I actually think that Aaron Sorkin might have gotten some inspiration for The American President from Nebraska where back a few years earlier Governor Robert Kerrey was involved with actress Debra Winger. I still remember a certain New York Post columnist named Ray Kerrison getting all kinds of hot and bothered when Winger spent a night in the Governor's mansion in Lincoln, Nebraska the same way Dreyfuss is doing here. What bothered him the most is that no one seemed to care about the horrible moral transgressions being committed in the Governor's mansion. Michael Sheen who would become an American President on a TV series created by Aaron Sorkin and Michael J. Fox are Douglas's two chief staff aides. Shawna Waldron has a nice performance as the President's daughter and she comes over like a real kid and a very unspoiled one at that considering where she's living. The American President is a class and classy drama and you only wish more presidents would act like Douglas and Sheen in their respective fictional presidencies.

    The American President (1995) What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don't usually go together). What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn't a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It's funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It's acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth. It's almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via "West Wing") he later becomes the president. But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, "Love Actually," with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind. In fact, I'm going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn't really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it's easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He's confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah. And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness. Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it's not only about politics. In fact it's a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out. Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as "Meathead") in "All in the Family." It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don't stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one. But here we have "The American President," deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours. I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.

    Many people are viewed as cynical or snobs because they can't enjoy a nice little rom-com or a modern fairy-tale like "Maid in Manhattan" or "Love Actually", but that's only because there are far superior films. "The American President" is one of them. "This is my first time at the White House. I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality" says Annette Bening to a guard, with a childish and communicative enthusiasm. In no doubt, this is the screenwriter's recognition of the spirit that guided him when he wrote the delightful romantic comedy "The American President". Aaron Sorkin, last year's winner for "The Social Network" indeed insufflates a "Capra-esque quality" with a modern sauce to make the film an absolute delight. I can't believe the film got only one nomination for Best Original Score, and nothing for the Screenplay, for Rob Reiner's confident directing, or the art-design, considering its meticulous attention to recreate the Presidential environment. I'm not the greatest fan of romantic comedies, but when it reaches such a level of greatness, I think it should be dignified with a more Academic recognition. Take Annette Benign as Sydney, the environmentalist who conquers the President's heart, yes she's not playing a tormented character but within the range of emotions required for her role, she's perfect. She's cute, witty, with the mimics of a little girl, but also manages to be sensual and absolutely intimidating. She never even falls in the typical "hard-to-get clich&eacute;", because she obviously is also attracted to Shepherd. On the other side, Andrew Shepherd, the titular president is charismatic, ultra-popular, but his specificity relies on his marital status, or as a matter of fact, its absence since he's a widower. Yet he immediately falls in love with Sydney, amazed by her striking good looks and intrigued by her exuberant yet indubitably brilliant personality. We believe that both characters fall in love so quick because they're genuinely appealing. And Shepherd's struggles to seduce Sydney, from the flowers to his own daughter's advice, conveys the state of mind of a man who's totally in love and in the meanwhile provides some of the film's best gags. I could have seen George Clooney playing Shepherd's role if the film was made today, but I doubt he'd pull off as much vulnerability and innocent enthusiasm as Douglas did. Douglas literally plays three characters, there's the President within his own staff and entourage, there's Andy the private man, and there's the President as a 'character' for the Press, the public and the Opposition. And it's thrilling that we never really know when he stops being President and when he becomes Andrew Shepherd or Andy, because Douglas carries this presidential aura like both a prestige and a handicap. For instance, he can date Sidney because no one can't say 'no' to the President', but he's still got to seduce her. He's the most powerful man in the world, but one can be wrong to believe it applies to every situation, especially the most intimate ones. The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media. Crime control, environment, lobbyism, pre-election campaign, and the notion of 'character', this idea that the character count more than actions, says a lot about the vision of politics conveyed by the script, not so far from Capra's visions by the way. Andy even believed that "If there had been a TV in every living room sixty years ago, this country wouldn't have elected a man in a wheelchair." Flirting with a witty cynicism, the film insists on the importance of appearances and illusions in a media-centric society, but it's only legitimate as long as it's not used to twist the truth. Beyond the comedic aspect, there's more depth in Douglas' character as a man who wants to act according to his beliefs and emotions, and not because he wants to please the crowd, not when it involves his privacy anyway, yet he's still stuck in his position as a President who has to answer to the Americans. In one poignant key-scene with A.J. Mackeray, his Chief of Staff and best friend, remarkably played by Martin Sheen, Andrew questions his own popularity and wonders if in a way; the cancer that took his wife away didn't pave his road to the White House by cementing a public empathy and make him relatively untouchable by the Opposition. The script is clever enough to let us judge by ourselves, Mackeray 'doesn't know" but through the film, it's obvious that the romance with Sidney doesn't serve his political ambitions and plays the reverse role than his status as a widower. His own Press Secretary clumsily admits "We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower." But nonetheless, Shepherd is appealing because he doesn't want to be 'an image' and it's this very integrity that hit a sensitive chord in Sydney, she doesn't fall in love just because he is what he is. The chemistry between the lead cuts straight to our hearts because of the solid characterization solid and top-notch writing, this is an adult and intelligent film. One of the best comedies of the 90's, "The American President" is also served by an impeccable gallery of supporting performances, from Richard Dreyfus as the Republican opponent Bob Rumson to Michael J. Fox, who steals the scene as Lewis, the Domestic Policy adviser. Fox gives such an electrifying performance that I wish he had more screen-time, his performance could have been Oscar-material. (All that said "The American President" is a flawless film, with maybe one little unforgivable mistake: with all the attention paid to little details in order to create an authentic feeling, they could have afforded a Native French speaker to play the French President.)

    Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely "clued in", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.

    It should have been apparent when "Written by Aaron Sorkin" appeared on the screen, but government is only a tool in this film. Sorkin uses it with his usual degree of shrewdness, but political concerns are nothing more than an impetus - a joke. THE American PRESIDENT focuses on the most powerful man on the planet. To what is his power relegated? Jokes. Examining the film reveals that most references to political topics are implemented as gags. Shepherd's position of power is a running line, joined by federal disasters, Tel Aviv hostility, assassination, corruption, and dead Japanese leaders, only to name a few. These references are often planted into the script as irony, encouraging the audience to feel that the President deals with Middle Eastern militants like we do the dishes. The larger point of this is also tied to the remarkable success of the film. Sorkin knows every trick in the book and he is shamelessly employing them. Reiners directing is completely unremarkable, but it would be impossible to fail with this script. Why do the conservatives look bad? Because they care about family values. THE American PRESIDENT is the pinnacle of Hollywood Liberalism, or "safe" liberalism. Shepherd is: the same as most people and entirely different from most people. The jokes and the sweetness all bank on Shepherd appearing as one of us. But he's not. The worst things people can do in this film are prioritize something that conflicts with a man who seems not to conflict with anything. THE American PRESIDENT, while being a terribly successful Rom-Com, teaches us something interesting about how Hollywood operates. This movie could hardly anger anyone. And that is precisely because of the script's perpetuation of contradiction and fantasy. The less political, the better. Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen both deliver knockout performances that manage to become something more than Sorkin's mouth. 62.0000

    US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy. Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist. Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency. This is not exactly a political thriller. In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine. However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing. However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing. Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well. Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or "oil baron" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

Both Julia Gardiner Tyler and Edith Bolling Galt Wilson were each remarkable first ladies in their own ways and Mrs. Wilson did become a minor issue in her husband's bid for a second term. But none ever engendered the controversy shown here by President Michael Douglas's courtship of Annette Bening. The fictional Douglas is a widower like Tyler and Wilson and he meets and falls hard for an environmental lobbyist. When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition. The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film. I actually think that Aaron Sorkin might have gotten some inspiration for The American President from Nebraska where back a few years earlier Governor Robert Kerrey was involved with actress Debra Winger. I still remember a certain New York Post columnist named Ray Kerrison getting all kinds of hot and bothered when Winger spent a night in the Governor's mansion in Lincoln, Nebraska the same way Dreyfuss is doing here. What bothered him the most is that no one seemed to care about the horrible moral transgressions being committed in the Governor's mansion. Michael Sheen who would become an American President on a TV series created by Aaron Sorkin and Michael J. Fox are Douglas's two chief staff aides. Shawna Waldron has a nice performance as the President's daughter and she comes over like a real kid and a very unspoiled one at that considering where she's living. The American President is a class and classy drama and you only wish more presidents would act like Douglas and Sheen in their respective fictional presidencies.

    The American President (1995) What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don't usually go together). What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn't a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It's funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It's acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth. It's almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via "West Wing") he later becomes the president. But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, "Love Actually," with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind. In fact, I'm going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn't really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it's easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He's confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah. And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness. Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it's not only about politics. In fact it's a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out. Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as "Meathead") in "All in the Family." It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don't stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one. But here we have "The American President," deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours. I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.

    Many people are viewed as cynical or snobs because they can't enjoy a nice little rom-com or a modern fairy-tale like "Maid in Manhattan" or "Love Actually", but that's only because there are far superior films. "The American President" is one of them. "This is my first time at the White House. I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality" says Annette Bening to a guard, with a childish and communicative enthusiasm. In no doubt, this is the screenwriter's recognition of the spirit that guided him when he wrote the delightful romantic comedy "The American President". Aaron Sorkin, last year's winner for "The Social Network" indeed insufflates a "Capra-esque quality" with a modern sauce to make the film an absolute delight. I can't believe the film got only one nomination for Best Original Score, and nothing for the Screenplay, for Rob Reiner's confident directing, or the art-design, considering its meticulous attention to recreate the Presidential environment. I'm not the greatest fan of romantic comedies, but when it reaches such a level of greatness, I think it should be dignified with a more Academic recognition. Take Annette Benign as Sydney, the environmentalist who conquers the President's heart, yes she's not playing a tormented character but within the range of emotions required for her role, she's perfect. She's cute, witty, with the mimics of a little girl, but also manages to be sensual and absolutely intimidating. She never even falls in the typical "hard-to-get clich&eacute;", because she obviously is also attracted to Shepherd. On the other side, Andrew Shepherd, the titular president is charismatic, ultra-popular, but his specificity relies on his marital status, or as a matter of fact, its absence since he's a widower. Yet he immediately falls in love with Sydney, amazed by her striking good looks and intrigued by her exuberant yet indubitably brilliant personality. We believe that both characters fall in love so quick because they're genuinely appealing. And Shepherd's struggles to seduce Sydney, from the flowers to his own daughter's advice, conveys the state of mind of a man who's totally in love and in the meanwhile provides some of the film's best gags. I could have seen George Clooney playing Shepherd's role if the film was made today, but I doubt he'd pull off as much vulnerability and innocent enthusiasm as Douglas did. Douglas literally plays three characters, there's the President within his own staff and entourage, there's Andy the private man, and there's the President as a 'character' for the Press, the public and the Opposition. And it's thrilling that we never really know when he stops being President and when he becomes Andrew Shepherd or Andy, because Douglas carries this presidential aura like both a prestige and a handicap. For instance, he can date Sidney because no one can't say 'no' to the President', but he's still got to seduce her. He's the most powerful man in the world, but one can be wrong to believe it applies to every situation, especially the most intimate ones. The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media. Crime control, environment, lobbyism, pre-election campaign, and the notion of 'character', this idea that the character count more than actions, says a lot about the vision of politics conveyed by the script, not so far from Capra's visions by the way. Andy even believed that "If there had been a TV in every living room sixty years ago, this country wouldn't have elected a man in a wheelchair." Flirting with a witty cynicism, the film insists on the importance of appearances and illusions in a media-centric society, but it's only legitimate as long as it's not used to twist the truth. Beyond the comedic aspect, there's more depth in Douglas' character as a man who wants to act according to his beliefs and emotions, and not because he wants to please the crowd, not when it involves his privacy anyway, yet he's still stuck in his position as a President who has to answer to the Americans. In one poignant key-scene with A.J. Mackeray, his Chief of Staff and best friend, remarkably played by Martin Sheen, Andrew questions his own popularity and wonders if in a way; the cancer that took his wife away didn't pave his road to the White House by cementing a public empathy and make him relatively untouchable by the Opposition. The script is clever enough to let us judge by ourselves, Mackeray 'doesn't know" but through the film, it's obvious that the romance with Sidney doesn't serve his political ambitions and plays the reverse role than his status as a widower. His own Press Secretary clumsily admits "We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower." But nonetheless, Shepherd is appealing because he doesn't want to be 'an image' and it's this very integrity that hit a sensitive chord in Sydney, she doesn't fall in love just because he is what he is. The chemistry between the lead cuts straight to our hearts because of the solid characterization solid and top-notch writing, this is an adult and intelligent film. One of the best comedies of the 90's, "The American President" is also served by an impeccable gallery of supporting performances, from Richard Dreyfus as the Republican opponent Bob Rumson to Michael J. Fox, who steals the scene as Lewis, the Domestic Policy adviser. Fox gives such an electrifying performance that I wish he had more screen-time, his performance could have been Oscar-material. (All that said "The American President" is a flawless film, with maybe one little unforgivable mistake: with all the attention paid to little details in order to create an authentic feeling, they could have afforded a Native French speaker to play the French President.)

    Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely "clued in", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.

    It should have been apparent when "Written by Aaron Sorkin" appeared on the screen, but government is only a tool in this film. Sorkin uses it with his usual degree of shrewdness, but political concerns are nothing more than an impetus - a joke. THE American PRESIDENT focuses on the most powerful man on the planet. To what is his power relegated? Jokes. Examining the film reveals that most references to political topics are implemented as gags. Shepherd's position of power is a running line, joined by federal disasters, Tel Aviv hostility, assassination, corruption, and dead Japanese leaders, only to name a few. These references are often planted into the script as irony, encouraging the audience to feel that the President deals with Middle Eastern militants like we do the dishes. The larger point of this is also tied to the remarkable success of the film. Sorkin knows every trick in the book and he is shamelessly employing them. Reiners directing is completely unremarkable, but it would be impossible to fail with this script. Why do the conservatives look bad? Because they care about family values. THE American PRESIDENT is the pinnacle of Hollywood Liberalism, or "safe" liberalism. Shepherd is: the same as most people and entirely different from most people. The jokes and the sweetness all bank on Shepherd appearing as one of us. But he's not. The worst things people can do in this film are prioritize something that conflicts with a man who seems not to conflict with anything. THE American PRESIDENT, while being a terribly successful Rom-Com, teaches us something interesting about how Hollywood operates. This movie could hardly anger anyone. And that is precisely because of the script's perpetuation of contradiction and fantasy. The less political, the better. Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen both deliver knockout performances that manage to become something more than Sorkin's mouth. 62.0000

    US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy. Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist. Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency. This is not exactly a political thriller. In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine. However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing. However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing. Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well. Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or "oil baron" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

    Extraordinary movie about an extraordinary president. I would vote for Andrew Shepherd right now if I had the chance. The writers did a fantastic job of portraying the game of politics, the intricacies of a blossoming new relationship, and the balance between the two. Douglas was phenomenal in this role, as was Annette Benning. I came away from it feeling energized in several ways. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I would even recommend that it be shown in civics courses in high school and college - not for the love story, which I really felt was secondary to the story about the workings of government. Although, make no mistakes about it, the love story was just as fantastic!

    The American President is the wildest wish-fulfilment: the presentation to Congress of a bill to cut C02 emissions by 20 per cent in the next 10 years. Unheard of then, and certainly unheard of now. It made the President's love affair in this movie, and it would have promised to change the direction of the USA in 1995. However, in 2008, after General Motors went bust, America bought the company and it went back into business with bigger cars, all of them gas-guzzlers. Far from resembling anything in The American President, it has been downhill all the way. Now the USA wants all of Canada's evil tar sands for itself and is fielding "environmentalists" to stop it being shipped to China. Rob Reiner made a very decent, upbeat movie, that showed great promise for the Republic in the right hands. Sadly, it has now become a relic of a former era. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the lift it gave me and I recommend it to others.

    A beautifully crafted film that works on every level. It gives you great insight into American politics, particularly re-election but politics is just one thread woven through this superb tapestry of a tale. The romance is beautifully crafted, with just the right amounts of humour, nervousness and sensuality. The supporting cast are well served by a sparkling script; Sheen, Fox and Waldren get some great one liners And just wait for the quality and majesty of Andrew Shepherd's press conference at towards the end of the film

    This movie appeared before the American president as a hero movies (ID4 and Airforce One) but it still a very pro-American president movie. At the time of this movie, there was no hint of disgrace within the Presidency. It was late 1997, 1998 that the whole Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones affairs hit the media. Nixon and the affairs of Watergate are far behind us so the president was somebody to look up to and admire. Somebody to follow and worship and a position to aspire to. What surprised me about this movie though is that it made the President a normal person. President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a single president, actually a widower. His wife died during his election campaign and this was used successfully to elect him to office. He did not use it because Andrew Shepherd is portrayed as an honest president who loved his wife dearly, but the events that transpired severely hindered the opposition. One day, while debating a bill, an environmental lobbyist decided to speak her mind to the president and this impressed him. He is surrounded by people calling him sir and Mr President: even his best friend refuses to treat him as an equal, and thus he is lonely. He is not a megalomaniac, but rather a president that wants the best for people. He is one that wants to serve the people and not be considered to be too important to talk to normal people. Unfortunately, as president, he cannot escape this. A normal walk down the White House brings marine soldiers saluting him, and he cannot go anywhere without the press following him. He cannot even have a private relationship without the press plastering it all over the papers and the opposition using it against him. The movie is not about the President trying to get this girl, he has her right from the beginning. Rather it deals with the pressures of public life and the problems that they put on the relationship. The real struggles come from the guilt that his girlfriend (Annette Bening) has in regards to the president's daughter, and the fact that people will accuse her of manipulating the president. The greater problem, the one the movie is focused around, it the president struggling with the nature of his private life. He refuses to bring his relationship into the open, nor to defend it, while his opponent is constantly attacking it by dragging up the past. One theme that came through this movie is the realisation of the problems of being president. The major one is the publicity of his private life. The press follows him everywhere and everybody knows what he did with his girlfriend. The first time she spent the night over there, everybody in America knew. Thus I think this movie is an attack against the publicity of some of these lives. It depends on the person  some like to have their lives publicised, while others just can't escape from the press. Generally people do not like the press questioning their activities, especially when they are illegal. In this movie, it is not illegal, but rather private. The American President is a comedy though, but most of the comedy is focused around reactions of normal people to the American President. He has a habit of going out to the people and meeting them face to face. In this movie we laugh at the thing people do when they are nervous, especially when the President rings up. We laugh even more at the way people grovel to him, and their disbelief in the fact that he is personally calling them. This movie forces us to accept the president as a normal person, somebody who loves, hates, and does everything else that we do.

And it's thrilling that we never really know when he stops being President and when he becomes Andrew Shepherd or Andy, because Douglas carries this presidential aura like both a prestige and a handicap. For instance, he can date Sidney because no one can't say 'no' to the President', but he's still got to seduce her. He's the most powerful man in the world, but one can be wrong to believe it applies to every situation, especially the most intimate ones. The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media. Crime control, environment, lobbyism, pre-election campaign, and the notion of 'character', this idea that the character count more than actions, says a lot about the vision of politics conveyed by the script, not so far from Capra's visions by the way. Andy even believed that "If there had been a TV in every living room sixty years ago, this country wouldn't have elected a man in a wheelchair." Flirting with a witty cynicism, the film insists on the importance of appearances and illusions in a media-centric society, but it's only legitimate as long as it's not used to twist the truth. Beyond the comedic aspect, there's more depth in Douglas' character as a man who wants to act according to his beliefs and emotions, and not because he wants to please the crowd, not when it involves his privacy anyway, yet he's still stuck in his position as a President who has to answer to the Americans. In one poignant key-scene with A.J. Mackeray, his Chief of Staff and best friend, remarkably played by Martin Sheen, Andrew questions his own popularity and wonders if in a way; the cancer that took his wife away didn't pave his road to the White House by cementing a public empathy and make him relatively untouchable by the Opposition. The script is clever enough to let us judge by ourselves, Mackeray 'doesn't know" but through the film, it's obvious that the romance with Sidney doesn't serve his political ambitions and plays the reverse role than his status as a widower. His own Press Secretary clumsily admits "We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower." But nonetheless, Shepherd is appealing because he doesn't want to be 'an image' and it's this very integrity that hit a sensitive chord in Sydney, she doesn't fall in love just because he is what he is. The chemistry between the lead cuts straight to our hearts because of the solid characterization solid and top-notch writing, this is an adult and intelligent film. One of the best comedies of the 90's, "The American President" is also served by an impeccable gallery of supporting performances, from Richard Dreyfus as the Republican opponent Bob Rumson to Michael J. Fox, who steals the scene as Lewis, the Domestic Policy adviser. Fox gives such an electrifying performance that I wish he had more screen-time, his performance could have been Oscar-material. (All that said "The American President" is a flawless film, with maybe one little unforgivable mistake: with all the attention paid to little details in order to create an authentic feeling, they could have afforded a Native French speaker to play the French President.)

    Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely "clued in", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.

    It should have been apparent when "Written by Aaron Sorkin" appeared on the screen, but government is only a tool in this film. Sorkin uses it with his usual degree of shrewdness, but political concerns are nothing more than an impetus - a joke. THE American PRESIDENT focuses on the most powerful man on the planet. To what is his power relegated? Jokes. Examining the film reveals that most references to political topics are implemented as gags. Shepherd's position of power is a running line, joined by federal disasters, Tel Aviv hostility, assassination, corruption, and dead Japanese leaders, only to name a few. These references are often planted into the script as irony, encouraging the audience to feel that the President deals with Middle Eastern militants like we do the dishes. The larger point of this is also tied to the remarkable success of the film. Sorkin knows every trick in the book and he is shamelessly employing them. Reiners directing is completely unremarkable, but it would be impossible to fail with this script. Why do the conservatives look bad? Because they care about family values. THE American PRESIDENT is the pinnacle of Hollywood Liberalism, or "safe" liberalism. Shepherd is: the same as most people and entirely different from most people. The jokes and the sweetness all bank on Shepherd appearing as one of us. But he's not. The worst things people can do in this film are prioritize something that conflicts with a man who seems not to conflict with anything. THE American PRESIDENT, while being a terribly successful Rom-Com, teaches us something interesting about how Hollywood operates. This movie could hardly anger anyone. And that is precisely because of the script's perpetuation of contradiction and fantasy. The less political, the better. Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen both deliver knockout performances that manage to become something more than Sorkin's mouth. 62.0000

    US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy. Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist. Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency. This is not exactly a political thriller. In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine. However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing. However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing. Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well. Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or "oil baron" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

    Extraordinary movie about an extraordinary president. I would vote for Andrew Shepherd right now if I had the chance. The writers did a fantastic job of portraying the game of politics, the intricacies of a blossoming new relationship, and the balance between the two. Douglas was phenomenal in this role, as was Annette Benning. I came away from it feeling energized in several ways. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I would even recommend that it be shown in civics courses in high school and college - not for the love story, which I really felt was secondary to the story about the workings of government. Although, make no mistakes about it, the love story was just as fantastic!

    The American President is the wildest wish-fulfilment: the presentation to Congress of a bill to cut C02 emissions by 20 per cent in the next 10 years. Unheard of then, and certainly unheard of now. It made the President's love affair in this movie, and it would have promised to change the direction of the USA in 1995. However, in 2008, after General Motors went bust, America bought the company and it went back into business with bigger cars, all of them gas-guzzlers. Far from resembling anything in The American President, it has been downhill all the way. Now the USA wants all of Canada's evil tar sands for itself and is fielding "environmentalists" to stop it being shipped to China. Rob Reiner made a very decent, upbeat movie, that showed great promise for the Republic in the right hands. Sadly, it has now become a relic of a former era. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the lift it gave me and I recommend it to others.

    A beautifully crafted film that works on every level. It gives you great insight into American politics, particularly re-election but politics is just one thread woven through this superb tapestry of a tale. The romance is beautifully crafted, with just the right amounts of humour, nervousness and sensuality. The supporting cast are well served by a sparkling script; Sheen, Fox and Waldren get some great one liners And just wait for the quality and majesty of Andrew Shepherd's press conference at towards the end of the film

    This movie appeared before the American president as a hero movies (ID4 and Airforce One) but it still a very pro-American president movie. At the time of this movie, there was no hint of disgrace within the Presidency. It was late 1997, 1998 that the whole Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones affairs hit the media. Nixon and the affairs of Watergate are far behind us so the president was somebody to look up to and admire. Somebody to follow and worship and a position to aspire to. What surprised me about this movie though is that it made the President a normal person. President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a single president, actually a widower. His wife died during his election campaign and this was used successfully to elect him to office. He did not use it because Andrew Shepherd is portrayed as an honest president who loved his wife dearly, but the events that transpired severely hindered the opposition. One day, while debating a bill, an environmental lobbyist decided to speak her mind to the president and this impressed him. He is surrounded by people calling him sir and Mr President: even his best friend refuses to treat him as an equal, and thus he is lonely. He is not a megalomaniac, but rather a president that wants the best for people. He is one that wants to serve the people and not be considered to be too important to talk to normal people. Unfortunately, as president, he cannot escape this. A normal walk down the White House brings marine soldiers saluting him, and he cannot go anywhere without the press following him. He cannot even have a private relationship without the press plastering it all over the papers and the opposition using it against him. The movie is not about the President trying to get this girl, he has her right from the beginning. Rather it deals with the pressures of public life and the problems that they put on the relationship. The real struggles come from the guilt that his girlfriend (Annette Bening) has in regards to the president's daughter, and the fact that people will accuse her of manipulating the president. The greater problem, the one the movie is focused around, it the president struggling with the nature of his private life. He refuses to bring his relationship into the open, nor to defend it, while his opponent is constantly attacking it by dragging up the past. One theme that came through this movie is the realisation of the problems of being president. The major one is the publicity of his private life. The press follows him everywhere and everybody knows what he did with his girlfriend. The first time she spent the night over there, everybody in America knew. Thus I think this movie is an attack against the publicity of some of these lives. It depends on the person  some like to have their lives publicised, while others just can't escape from the press. Generally people do not like the press questioning their activities, especially when they are illegal. In this movie, it is not illegal, but rather private. The American President is a comedy though, but most of the comedy is focused around reactions of normal people to the American President. He has a habit of going out to the people and meeting them face to face. In this movie we laugh at the thing people do when they are nervous, especially when the President rings up. We laugh even more at the way people grovel to him, and their disbelief in the fact that he is personally calling them. This movie forces us to accept the president as a normal person, somebody who loves, hates, and does everything else that we do.

    Out of the 42 individuals who have become presidents two of them, John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson, had wives who died while they were in the White House and who courted and married women who became the second first ladies in their respective administrations. Both Julia Gardiner Tyler and Edith Bolling Galt Wilson were each remarkable first ladies in their own ways and Mrs. Wilson did become a minor issue in her husband's bid for a second term. But none ever engendered the controversy shown here by President Michael Douglas's courtship of Annette Bening. The fictional Douglas is a widower like Tyler and Wilson and he meets and falls hard for an environmental lobbyist. When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition. The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film. I actually think that Aaron Sorkin might have gotten some inspiration for The American President from Nebraska where back a few years earlier Governor Robert Kerrey was involved with actress Debra Winger. I still remember a certain New York Post columnist named Ray Kerrison getting all kinds of hot and bothered when Winger spent a night in the Governor's mansion in Lincoln, Nebraska the same way Dreyfuss is doing here. What bothered him the most is that no one seemed to care about the horrible moral transgressions being committed in the Governor's mansion. Michael Sheen who would become an American President on a TV series created by Aaron Sorkin and Michael J. Fox are Douglas's two chief staff aides. Shawna Waldron has a nice performance as the President's daughter and she comes over like a real kid and a very unspoiled one at that considering where she's living. The American President is a class and classy drama and you only wish more presidents would act like Douglas and Sheen in their respective fictional presidencies.

    The American President (1995) What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don't usually go together). What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn't a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It's funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It's acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth. It's almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via "West Wing") he later becomes the president. But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, "Love Actually," with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind. In fact, I'm going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn't really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it's easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He's confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah. And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness. Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it's not only about politics. In fact it's a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out. Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as "Meathead") in "All in the Family." It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don't stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one. But here we have "The American President," deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours. I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.

    Many people are viewed as cynical or snobs because they can't enjoy a nice little rom-com or a modern fairy-tale like "Maid in Manhattan" or "Love Actually", but that's only because there are far superior films. "The American President" is one of them. "This is my first time at the White House. I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality" says Annette Bening to a guard, with a childish and communicative enthusiasm. In no doubt, this is the screenwriter's recognition of the spirit that guided him when he wrote the delightful romantic comedy "The American President". Aaron Sorkin, last year's winner for "The Social Network" indeed insufflates a "Capra-esque quality" with a modern sauce to make the film an absolute delight. I can't believe the film got only one nomination for Best Original Score, and nothing for the Screenplay, for Rob Reiner's confident directing, or the art-design, considering its meticulous attention to recreate the Presidential environment. I'm not the greatest fan of romantic comedies, but when it reaches such a level of greatness, I think it should be dignified with a more Academic recognition. Take Annette Benign as Sydney, the environmentalist who conquers the President's heart, yes she's not playing a tormented character but within the range of emotions required for her role, she's perfect. She's cute, witty, with the mimics of a little girl, but also manages to be sensual and absolutely intimidating. She never even falls in the typical "hard-to-get clich&eacute;", because she obviously is also attracted to Shepherd. On the other side, Andrew Shepherd, the titular president is charismatic, ultra-popular, but his specificity relies on his marital status, or as a matter of fact, its absence since he's a widower. Yet he immediately falls in love with Sydney, amazed by her striking good looks and intrigued by her exuberant yet indubitably brilliant personality. We believe that both characters fall in love so quick because they're genuinely appealing. And Shepherd's struggles to seduce Sydney, from the flowers to his own daughter's advice, conveys the state of mind of a man who's totally in love and in the meanwhile provides some of the film's best gags. I could have seen George Clooney playing Shepherd's role if the film was made today, but I doubt he'd pull off as much vulnerability and innocent enthusiasm as Douglas did. Douglas literally plays three characters, there's the President within his own staff and entourage, there's Andy the private man, and there's the President as a 'character' for the Press, the public and the Opposition. And it's thrilling that we never really know when he stops being President and when he becomes Andrew Shepherd or Andy, because Douglas carries this presidential aura like both a prestige and a handicap. For instance, he can date Sidney because no one can't say 'no' to the President', but he's still got to seduce her. He's the most powerful man in the world, but one can be wrong to believe it applies to every situation, especially the most intimate ones. The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media.

Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

    Extraordinary movie about an extraordinary president. I would vote for Andrew Shepherd right now if I had the chance. The writers did a fantastic job of portraying the game of politics, the intricacies of a blossoming new relationship, and the balance between the two. Douglas was phenomenal in this role, as was Annette Benning. I came away from it feeling energized in several ways. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I would even recommend that it be shown in civics courses in high school and college - not for the love story, which I really felt was secondary to the story about the workings of government. Although, make no mistakes about it, the love story was just as fantastic!

    The American President is the wildest wish-fulfilment: the presentation to Congress of a bill to cut C02 emissions by 20 per cent in the next 10 years. Unheard of then, and certainly unheard of now. It made the President's love affair in this movie, and it would have promised to change the direction of the USA in 1995. However, in 2008, after General Motors went bust, America bought the company and it went back into business with bigger cars, all of them gas-guzzlers. Far from resembling anything in The American President, it has been downhill all the way. Now the USA wants all of Canada's evil tar sands for itself and is fielding "environmentalists" to stop it being shipped to China. Rob Reiner made a very decent, upbeat movie, that showed great promise for the Republic in the right hands. Sadly, it has now become a relic of a former era. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the lift it gave me and I recommend it to others.

    This movie appeared before the American president as a hero movies (ID4 and Airforce One) but it still a very pro-American president movie. At the time of this movie, there was no hint of disgrace within the Presidency. It was late 1997, 1998 that the whole Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones affairs hit the media. Nixon and the affairs of Watergate are far behind us so the president was somebody to look up to and admire. Somebody to follow and worship and a position to aspire to. What surprised me about this movie though is that it made the President a normal person. President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a single president, actually a widower. His wife died during his election campaign and this was used successfully to elect him to office. He did not use it because Andrew Shepherd is portrayed as an honest president who loved his wife dearly, but the events that transpired severely hindered the opposition. One day, while debating a bill, an environmental lobbyist decided to speak her mind to the president and this impressed him. He is surrounded by people calling him sir and Mr President: even his best friend refuses to treat him as an equal, and thus he is lonely. He is not a megalomaniac, but rather a president that wants the best for people. He is one that wants to serve the people and not be considered to be too important to talk to normal people. Unfortunately, as president, he cannot escape this. A normal walk down the White House brings marine soldiers saluting him, and he cannot go anywhere without the press following him. He cannot even have a private relationship without the press plastering it all over the papers and the opposition using it against him. The movie is not about the President trying to get this girl, he has her right from the beginning. Rather it deals with the pressures of public life and the problems that they put on the relationship. The real struggles come from the guilt that his girlfriend (Annette Bening) has in regards to the president's daughter, and the fact that people will accuse her of manipulating the president. The greater problem, the one the movie is focused around, it the president struggling with the nature of his private life. He refuses to bring his relationship into the open, nor to defend it, while his opponent is constantly attacking it by dragging up the past. One theme that came through this movie is the realisation of the problems of being president. The major one is the publicity of his private life. The press follows him everywhere and everybody knows what he did with his girlfriend. The first time she spent the night over there, everybody in America knew. Thus I think this movie is an attack against the publicity of some of these lives. It depends on the person  some like to have their lives publicised, while others just can't escape from the press. Generally people do not like the press questioning their activities, especially when they are illegal. In this movie, it is not illegal, but rather private. The American President is a comedy though, but most of the comedy is focused around reactions of normal people to the American President. He has a habit of going out to the people and meeting them face to face. In this movie we laugh at the thing people do when they are nervous, especially when the President rings up. We laugh even more at the way people grovel to him, and their disbelief in the fact that he is personally calling them. This movie forces us to accept the president as a normal person, somebody who loves, hates, and does everything else that we do.

    Out of the 42 individuals who have become presidents two of them, John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson, had wives who died while they were in the White House and who courted and married women who became the second first ladies in their respective administrations. Both Julia Gardiner Tyler and Edith Bolling Galt Wilson were each remarkable first ladies in their own ways and Mrs. Wilson did become a minor issue in her husband's bid for a second term. But none ever engendered the controversy shown here by President Michael Douglas's courtship of Annette Bening. The fictional Douglas is a widower like Tyler and Wilson and he meets and falls hard for an environmental lobbyist. When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition. The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film. I actually think that Aaron Sorkin might have gotten some inspiration for The American President from Nebraska where back a few years earlier Governor Robert Kerrey was involved with actress Debra Winger. I still remember a certain New York Post columnist named Ray Kerrison getting all kinds of hot and bothered when Winger spent a night in the Governor's mansion in Lincoln, Nebraska the same way Dreyfuss is doing here. What bothered him the most is that no one seemed to care about the horrible moral transgressions being committed in the Governor's mansion. Michael Sheen who would become an American President on a TV series created by Aaron Sorkin and Michael J. Fox are Douglas's two chief staff aides. Shawna Waldron has a nice performance as the President's daughter and she comes over like a real kid and a very unspoiled one at that considering where she's living. The American President is a class and classy drama and you only wish more presidents would act like Douglas and Sheen in their respective fictional presidencies.

    The American President (1995) What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don't usually go together). What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn't a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It's funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It's acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth. It's almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via "West Wing") he later becomes the president. But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, "Love Actually," with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind. In fact, I'm going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn't really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it's easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He's confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah. And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness. Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it's not only about politics. In fact it's a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out. Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as "Meathead") in "All in the Family." It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don't stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one. But here we have "The American President," deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours. I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.

    Many people are viewed as cynical or snobs because they can't enjoy a nice little rom-com or a modern fairy-tale like "Maid in Manhattan" or "Love Actually", but that's only because there are far superior films. "The American President" is one of them. "This is my first time at the White House. I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality" says Annette Bening to a guard, with a childish and communicative enthusiasm. In no doubt, this is the screenwriter's recognition of the spirit that guided him when he wrote the delightful romantic comedy "The American President". Aaron Sorkin, last year's winner for "The Social Network" indeed insufflates a "Capra-esque quality" with a modern sauce to make the film an absolute delight. I can't believe the film got only one nomination for Best Original Score, and nothing for the Screenplay, for Rob Reiner's confident directing, or the art-design, considering its meticulous attention to recreate the Presidential environment. I'm not the greatest fan of romantic comedies, but when it reaches such a level of greatness, I think it should be dignified with a more Academic recognition. Take Annette Benign as Sydney, the environmentalist who conquers the President's heart, yes she's not playing a tormented character but within the range of emotions required for her role, she's perfect. She's cute, witty, with the mimics of a little girl, but also manages to be sensual and absolutely intimidating. She never even falls in the typical "hard-to-get clich&eacute;", because she obviously is also attracted to Shepherd. On the other side, Andrew Shepherd, the titular president is charismatic, ultra-popular, but his specificity relies on his marital status, or as a matter of fact, its absence since he's a widower. Yet he immediately falls in love with Sydney, amazed by her striking good looks and intrigued by her exuberant yet indubitably brilliant personality. We believe that both characters fall in love so quick because they're genuinely appealing. And Shepherd's struggles to seduce Sydney, from the flowers to his own daughter's advice, conveys the state of mind of a man who's totally in love and in the meanwhile provides some of the film's best gags. I could have seen George Clooney playing Shepherd's role if the film was made today, but I doubt he'd pull off as much vulnerability and innocent enthusiasm as Douglas did. Douglas literally plays three characters, there's the President within his own staff and entourage, there's Andy the private man, and there's the President as a 'character' for the Press, the public and the Opposition. And it's thrilling that we never really know when he stops being President and when he becomes Andrew Shepherd or Andy, because Douglas carries this presidential aura like both a prestige and a handicap. For instance, he can date Sidney because no one can't say 'no' to the President', but he's still got to seduce her. He's the most powerful man in the world, but one can be wrong to believe it applies to every situation, especially the most intimate ones. The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media. Crime control, environment, lobbyism, pre-election campaign, and the notion of 'character', this idea that the character count more than actions, says a lot about the vision of politics conveyed by the script, not so far from Capra's visions by the way. Andy even believed that "If there had been a TV in every living room sixty years ago, this country wouldn't have elected a man in a wheelchair." Flirting with a witty cynicism, the film insists on the importance of appearances and illusions in a media-centric society, but it's only legitimate as long as it's not used to twist the truth. Beyond the comedic aspect, there's more depth in Douglas' character as a man who wants to act according to his beliefs and emotions, and not because he wants to please the crowd, not when it involves his privacy anyway, yet he's still stuck in his position as a President who has to answer to the Americans. In one poignant key-scene with A.J. Mackeray, his Chief of Staff and best friend, remarkably played by Martin Sheen, Andrew questions his own popularity and wonders if in a way; the cancer that took his wife away didn't pave his road to the White House by cementing a public empathy and make him relatively untouchable by the Opposition. The script is clever enough to let us judge by ourselves, Mackeray 'doesn't know" but through the film, it's obvious that the romance with Sidney doesn't serve his political ambitions and plays the reverse role than his status as a widower. His own Press Secretary clumsily admits "We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower." But nonetheless, Shepherd is appealing because he doesn't want to be 'an image' and it's this very integrity that hit a sensitive chord in Sydney, she doesn't fall in love just because he is what he is. The chemistry between the lead cuts straight to our hearts because of the solid characterization solid and top-notch writing, this is an adult and intelligent film. One of the best comedies of the 90's, "The American President" is also served by an impeccable gallery of supporting performances, from Richard Dreyfus as the Republican opponent Bob Rumson to Michael J. Fox, who steals the scene as Lewis, the Domestic Policy adviser. Fox gives such an electrifying performance that I wish he had more screen-time, his performance could have been Oscar-material. (All that said "The American President" is a flawless film, with maybe one little unforgivable mistake: with all the attention paid to little details in order to create an authentic feeling, they could have afforded a Native French speaker to play the French President.)

    Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely "clued in", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.

    It should have been apparent when "Written by Aaron Sorkin" appeared on the screen, but government is only a tool in this film. Sorkin uses it with his usual degree of shrewdness, but political concerns are nothing more than an impetus - a joke. THE American PRESIDENT focuses on the most powerful man on the planet. To what is his power relegated? Jokes. Examining the film reveals that most references to political topics are implemented as gags. Shepherd's position of power is a running line, joined by federal disasters, Tel Aviv hostility, assassination, corruption, and dead Japanese leaders, only to name a few. These references are often planted into the script as irony, encouraging the audience to feel that the President deals with Middle Eastern militants like we do the dishes. The larger point of this is also tied to the remarkable success of the film. Sorkin knows every trick in the book and he is shamelessly employing them. Reiners directing is completely unremarkable, but it would be impossible to fail with this script. Why do the conservatives look bad? Because they care about family values. THE American PRESIDENT is the pinnacle of Hollywood Liberalism, or "safe" liberalism. Shepherd is: the same as most people and entirely different from most people. The jokes and the sweetness all bank on Shepherd appearing as one of us. But he's not. The worst things people can do in this film are prioritize something that conflicts with a man who seems not to conflict with anything. THE American PRESIDENT, while being a terribly successful Rom-Com, teaches us something interesting about how Hollywood operates. This movie could hardly anger anyone. And that is precisely because of the script's perpetuation of contradiction and fantasy. The less political, the better. Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen both deliver knockout performances that manage to become something more than Sorkin's mouth. 62.0000

    US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy. Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist. Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency. This is not exactly a political thriller. In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine. However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing. However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing. Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well. Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or "oil baron" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition. The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film. I actually think that Aaron Sorkin might have gotten some inspiration for The American President from Nebraska where back a few years earlier Governor Robert Kerrey was involved with actress Debra Winger. I still remember a certain New York Post columnist named Ray Kerrison getting all kinds of hot and bothered when Winger spent a night in the Governor's mansion in Lincoln, Nebraska the same way Dreyfuss is doing here. What bothered him the most is that no one seemed to care about the horrible moral transgressions being committed in the Governor's mansion. Michael Sheen who would become an American President on a TV series created by Aaron Sorkin and Michael J. Fox are Douglas's two chief staff aides. Shawna Waldron has a nice performance as the President's daughter and she comes over like a real kid and a very unspoiled one at that considering where she's living. The American President is a class and classy drama and you only wish more presidents would act like Douglas and Sheen in their respective fictional presidencies.

    The American President (1995) What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don't usually go together). What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn't a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It's funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It's acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth. It's almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via "West Wing") he later becomes the president. But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, "Love Actually," with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind. In fact, I'm going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn't really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it's easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He's confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah. And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness. Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it's not only about politics. In fact it's a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out. Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as "Meathead") in "All in the Family." It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don't stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one. But here we have "The American President," deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours. I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.

    Many people are viewed as cynical or snobs because they can't enjoy a nice little rom-com or a modern fairy-tale like "Maid in Manhattan" or "Love Actually", but that's only because there are far superior films. "The American President" is one of them. "This is my first time at the White House. I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality" says Annette Bening to a guard, with a childish and communicative enthusiasm. In no doubt, this is the screenwriter's recognition of the spirit that guided him when he wrote the delightful romantic comedy "The American President". Aaron Sorkin, last year's winner for "The Social Network" indeed insufflates a "Capra-esque quality" with a modern sauce to make the film an absolute delight. I can't believe the film got only one nomination for Best Original Score, and nothing for the Screenplay, for Rob Reiner's confident directing, or the art-design, considering its meticulous attention to recreate the Presidential environment. I'm not the greatest fan of romantic comedies, but when it reaches such a level of greatness, I think it should be dignified with a more Academic recognition. Take Annette Benign as Sydney, the environmentalist who conquers the President's heart, yes she's not playing a tormented character but within the range of emotions required for her role, she's perfect. She's cute, witty, with the mimics of a little girl, but also manages to be sensual and absolutely intimidating. She never even falls in the typical "hard-to-get clich&eacute;", because she obviously is also attracted to Shepherd. On the other side, Andrew Shepherd, the titular president is charismatic, ultra-popular, but his specificity relies on his marital status, or as a matter of fact, its absence since he's a widower. Yet he immediately falls in love with Sydney, amazed by her striking good looks and intrigued by her exuberant yet indubitably brilliant personality. We believe that both characters fall in love so quick because they're genuinely appealing. And Shepherd's struggles to seduce Sydney, from the flowers to his own daughter's advice, conveys the state of mind of a man who's totally in love and in the meanwhile provides some of the film's best gags. I could have seen George Clooney playing Shepherd's role if the film was made today, but I doubt he'd pull off as much vulnerability and innocent enthusiasm as Douglas did. Douglas literally plays three characters, there's the President within his own staff and entourage, there's Andy the private man, and there's the President as a 'character' for the Press, the public and the Opposition. And it's thrilling that we never really know when he stops being President and when he becomes Andrew Shepherd or Andy, because Douglas carries this presidential aura like both a prestige and a handicap. For instance, he can date Sidney because no one can't say 'no' to the President', but he's still got to seduce her. He's the most powerful man in the world, but one can be wrong to believe it applies to every situation, especially the most intimate ones. The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media. Crime control, environment, lobbyism, pre-election campaign, and the notion of 'character', this idea that the character count more than actions, says a lot about the vision of politics conveyed by the script, not so far from Capra's visions by the way. Andy even believed that "If there had been a TV in every living room sixty years ago, this country wouldn't have elected a man in a wheelchair." Flirting with a witty cynicism, the film insists on the importance of appearances and illusions in a media-centric society, but it's only legitimate as long as it's not used to twist the truth. Beyond the comedic aspect, there's more depth in Douglas' character as a man who wants to act according to his beliefs and emotions, and not because he wants to please the crowd, not when it involves his privacy anyway, yet he's still stuck in his position as a President who has to answer to the Americans. In one poignant key-scene with A.J. Mackeray, his Chief of Staff and best friend, remarkably played by Martin Sheen, Andrew questions his own popularity and wonders if in a way; the cancer that took his wife away didn't pave his road to the White House by cementing a public empathy and make him relatively untouchable by the Opposition. The script is clever enough to let us judge by ourselves, Mackeray 'doesn't know" but through the film, it's obvious that the romance with Sidney doesn't serve his political ambitions and plays the reverse role than his status as a widower. His own Press Secretary clumsily admits "We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower." But nonetheless, Shepherd is appealing because he doesn't want to be 'an image' and it's this very integrity that hit a sensitive chord in Sydney, she doesn't fall in love just because he is what he is. The chemistry between the lead cuts straight to our hearts because of the solid characterization solid and top-notch writing, this is an adult and intelligent film. One of the best comedies of the 90's, "The American President" is also served by an impeccable gallery of supporting performances, from Richard Dreyfus as the Republican opponent Bob Rumson to Michael J. Fox, who steals the scene as Lewis, the Domestic Policy adviser. Fox gives such an electrifying performance that I wish he had more screen-time, his performance could have been Oscar-material. (All that said "The American President" is a flawless film, with maybe one little unforgivable mistake: with all the attention paid to little details in order to create an authentic feeling, they could have afforded a Native French speaker to play the French President.)

    Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely "clued in", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.

    It should have been apparent when "Written by Aaron Sorkin" appeared on the screen, but government is only a tool in this film. Sorkin uses it with his usual degree of shrewdness, but political concerns are nothing more than an impetus - a joke. THE American PRESIDENT focuses on the most powerful man on the planet. To what is his power relegated? Jokes. Examining the film reveals that most references to political topics are implemented as gags. Shepherd's position of power is a running line, joined by federal disasters, Tel Aviv hostility, assassination, corruption, and dead Japanese leaders, only to name a few. These references are often planted into the script as irony, encouraging the audience to feel that the President deals with Middle Eastern militants like we do the dishes. The larger point of this is also tied to the remarkable success of the film. Sorkin knows every trick in the book and he is shamelessly employing them. Reiners directing is completely unremarkable, but it would be impossible to fail with this script. Why do the conservatives look bad? Because they care about family values. THE American PRESIDENT is the pinnacle of Hollywood Liberalism, or "safe" liberalism. Shepherd is: the same as most people and entirely different from most people. The jokes and the sweetness all bank on Shepherd appearing as one of us. But he's not. The worst things people can do in this film are prioritize something that conflicts with a man who seems not to conflict with anything. THE American PRESIDENT, while being a terribly successful Rom-Com, teaches us something interesting about how Hollywood operates. This movie could hardly anger anyone. And that is precisely because of the script's perpetuation of contradiction and fantasy. The less political, the better. Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen both deliver knockout performances that manage to become something more than Sorkin's mouth. 62.0000

    US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy. Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist. Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency. This is not exactly a political thriller. In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine. However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing. However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing. Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well. Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or "oil baron" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

    Extraordinary movie about an extraordinary president. I would vote for Andrew Shepherd right now if I had the chance. The writers did a fantastic job of portraying the game of politics, the intricacies of a blossoming new relationship, and the balance between the two. Douglas was phenomenal in this role, as was Annette Benning. I came away from it feeling energized in several ways. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I would even recommend that it be shown in civics courses in high school and college - not for the love story, which I really felt was secondary to the story about the workings of government. Although, make no mistakes about it, the love story was just as fantastic!

    The American President is the wildest wish-fulfilment: the presentation to Congress of a bill to cut C02 emissions by 20 per cent in the next 10 years. Unheard of then, and certainly unheard of now. It made the President's love affair in this movie, and it would have promised to change the direction of the USA in 1995. However, in 2008, after General Motors went bust, America bought the company and it went back into business with bigger cars, all of them gas-guzzlers. Far from resembling anything in The American President, it has been downhill all the way. Now the USA wants all of Canada's evil tar sands for itself and is fielding "environmentalists" to stop it being shipped to China. Rob Reiner made a very decent, upbeat movie, that showed great promise for the Republic in the right hands. Sadly, it has now become a relic of a former era. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the lift it gave me and I recommend it to others.

    A beautifully crafted film that works on every level. It gives you great insight into American politics, particularly re-election but politics is just one thread woven through this superb tapestry of a tale. The romance is beautifully crafted, with just the right amounts of humour, nervousness and sensuality. The supporting cast are well served by a sparkling script; Sheen, Fox and Waldren get some great one liners And just wait for the quality and majesty of Andrew Shepherd's press conference at towards the end of the film

    This movie appeared before the American president as a hero movies (ID4 and Airforce One) but it still a very pro-American president movie. At the time of this movie, there was no hint of disgrace within the Presidency. It was late 1997, 1998 that the whole Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones affairs hit the media. Nixon and the affairs of Watergate are far behind us so the president was somebody to look up to and admire. Somebody to follow and worship and a position to aspire to. What surprised me about this movie though is that it made the President a normal person. President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a single president, actually a widower. His wife died during his election campaign and this was used successfully to elect him to office. He did not use it because Andrew Shepherd is portrayed as an honest president who loved his wife dearly, but the events that transpired severely hindered the opposition. One day, while debating a bill, an environmental lobbyist decided to speak her mind to the president and this impressed him. He is surrounded by people calling him sir and Mr President: even his best friend refuses to treat him as an equal, and thus he is lonely. He is not a megalomaniac, but rather a president that wants the best for people. He is one that wants to serve the people and not be considered to be too important to talk to normal people. Unfortunately, as president, he cannot escape this. A normal walk down the White House brings marine soldiers saluting him, and he cannot go anywhere without the press following him. He cannot even have a private relationship without the press plastering it all over the papers and the opposition using it against him. The movie is not about the President trying to get this girl, he has her right from the beginning. Rather it deals with the pressures of public life and the problems that they put on the relationship. The real struggles come from the guilt that his girlfriend (Annette Bening) has in regards to the president's daughter, and the fact that people will accuse her of manipulating the president. The greater problem, the one the movie is focused around, it the president struggling with the nature of his private life. He refuses to bring his relationship into the open, nor to defend it, while his opponent is constantly attacking it by dragging up the past. One theme that came through this movie is the realisation of the problems of being president. The major one is the publicity of his private life. The press follows him everywhere and everybody knows what he did with his girlfriend. The first time she spent the night over there, everybody in America knew. Thus I think this movie is an attack against the publicity of some of these lives. It depends on the person  some like to have their lives publicised, while others just can't escape from the press. Generally people do not like the press questioning their activities, especially when they are illegal. In this movie, it is not illegal, but rather private. The American President is a comedy though, but most of the comedy is focused around reactions of normal people to the American President. He has a habit of going out to the people and meeting them face to face. In this movie we laugh at the thing people do when they are nervous, especially when the President rings up. We laugh even more at the way people grovel to him, and their disbelief in the fact that he is personally calling them. This movie forces us to accept the president as a normal person, somebody who loves, hates, and does everything else that we do.

    Out of the 42 individuals who have become presidents two of them, John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson, had wives who died while they were in the White House and who courted and married women who became the second first ladies in their respective administrations. Both Julia Gardiner Tyler and Edith Bolling Galt Wilson were each remarkable first ladies in their own ways and Mrs. Wilson did become a minor issue in her husband's bid for a second term. But none ever engendered the controversy shown here by President Michael Douglas's courtship of Annette Bening. The fictional Douglas is a widower like Tyler and Wilson and he meets and falls hard for an environmental lobbyist. When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition. The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film.

The multi-layered personality serves the film's most comedic moments, but it also works as a powerful social commentary. Indeed, "The American President" is not just a feel-good romance or a witty comedy; it also affords to be a powerful political drama revealing the intricacies between politics and media. Crime control, environment, lobbyism, pre-election campaign, and the notion of 'character', this idea that the character count more than actions, says a lot about the vision of politics conveyed by the script, not so far from Capra's visions by the way. Andy even believed that "If there had been a TV in every living room sixty years ago, this country wouldn't have elected a man in a wheelchair." Flirting with a witty cynicism, the film insists on the importance of appearances and illusions in a media-centric society, but it's only legitimate as long as it's not used to twist the truth. Beyond the comedic aspect, there's more depth in Douglas' character as a man who wants to act according to his beliefs and emotions, and not because he wants to please the crowd, not when it involves his privacy anyway, yet he's still stuck in his position as a President who has to answer to the Americans. In one poignant key-scene with A.J. Mackeray, his Chief of Staff and best friend, remarkably played by Martin Sheen, Andrew questions his own popularity and wonders if in a way; the cancer that took his wife away didn't pave his road to the White House by cementing a public empathy and make him relatively untouchable by the Opposition. The script is clever enough to let us judge by ourselves, Mackeray 'doesn't know" but through the film, it's obvious that the romance with Sidney doesn't serve his political ambitions and plays the reverse role than his status as a widower. His own Press Secretary clumsily admits "We've never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower." But nonetheless, Shepherd is appealing because he doesn't want to be 'an image' and it's this very integrity that hit a sensitive chord in Sydney, she doesn't fall in love just because he is what he is. The chemistry between the lead cuts straight to our hearts because of the solid characterization solid and top-notch writing, this is an adult and intelligent film. One of the best comedies of the 90's, "The American President" is also served by an impeccable gallery of supporting performances, from Richard Dreyfus as the Republican opponent Bob Rumson to Michael J. Fox, who steals the scene as Lewis, the Domestic Policy adviser. Fox gives such an electrifying performance that I wish he had more screen-time, his performance could have been Oscar-material. (All that said "The American President" is a flawless film, with maybe one little unforgivable mistake: with all the attention paid to little details in order to create an authentic feeling, they could have afforded a Native French speaker to play the French President.)

    Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of 'normal' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely "clued in", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.

    It should have been apparent when "Written by Aaron Sorkin" appeared on the screen, but government is only a tool in this film. Sorkin uses it with his usual degree of shrewdness, but political concerns are nothing more than an impetus - a joke. THE American PRESIDENT focuses on the most powerful man on the planet. To what is his power relegated? Jokes. Examining the film reveals that most references to political topics are implemented as gags. Shepherd's position of power is a running line, joined by federal disasters, Tel Aviv hostility, assassination, corruption, and dead Japanese leaders, only to name a few. These references are often planted into the script as irony, encouraging the audience to feel that the President deals with Middle Eastern militants like we do the dishes. The larger point of this is also tied to the remarkable success of the film. Sorkin knows every trick in the book and he is shamelessly employing them. Reiners directing is completely unremarkable, but it would be impossible to fail with this script. Why do the conservatives look bad? Because they care about family values. THE American PRESIDENT is the pinnacle of Hollywood Liberalism, or "safe" liberalism. Shepherd is: the same as most people and entirely different from most people. The jokes and the sweetness all bank on Shepherd appearing as one of us. But he's not. The worst things people can do in this film are prioritize something that conflicts with a man who seems not to conflict with anything. THE American PRESIDENT, while being a terribly successful Rom-Com, teaches us something interesting about how Hollywood operates. This movie could hardly anger anyone. And that is precisely because of the script's perpetuation of contradiction and fantasy. The less political, the better. Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen both deliver knockout performances that manage to become something more than Sorkin's mouth. 62.0000

    US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy. Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist. Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency. This is not exactly a political thriller. In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine. However that's the point, this film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen's President in TV's The West Wing. However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing. Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well. Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or "oil baron" Bush who would you pick? Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do. The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances. Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it's done with so much class that it's hard not to like it. Not brilliant, but very enjoyable all the same.

    Extraordinary movie about an extraordinary president. I would vote for Andrew Shepherd right now if I had the chance. The writers did a fantastic job of portraying the game of politics, the intricacies of a blossoming new relationship, and the balance between the two. Douglas was phenomenal in this role, as was Annette Benning. I came away from it feeling energized in several ways. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I would even recommend that it be shown in civics courses in high school and college - not for the love story, which I really felt was secondary to the story about the workings of government. Although, make no mistakes about it, the love story was just as fantastic!

    The American President is the wildest wish-fulfilment: the presentation to Congress of a bill to cut C02 emissions by 20 per cent in the next 10 years. Unheard of then, and certainly unheard of now. It made the President's love affair in this movie, and it would have promised to change the direction of the USA in 1995. However, in 2008, after General Motors went bust, America bought the company and it went back into business with bigger cars, all of them gas-guzzlers. Far from resembling anything in The American President, it has been downhill all the way. Now the USA wants all of Canada's evil tar sands for itself and is fielding "environmentalists" to stop it being shipped to China. Rob Reiner made a very decent, upbeat movie, that showed great promise for the Republic in the right hands. Sadly, it has now become a relic of a former era. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the lift it gave me and I recommend it to others.

    A beautifully crafted film that works on every level. It gives you great insight into American politics, particularly re-election but politics is just one thread woven through this superb tapestry of a tale. The romance is beautifully crafted, with just the right amounts of humour, nervousness and sensuality. The supporting cast are well served by a sparkling script; Sheen, Fox and Waldren get some great one liners And just wait for the quality and majesty of Andrew Shepherd's press conference at towards the end of the film

    This movie appeared before the American president as a hero movies (ID4 and Airforce One) but it still a very pro-American president movie. At the time of this movie, there was no hint of disgrace within the Presidency. It was late 1997, 1998 that the whole Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones affairs hit the media. Nixon and the affairs of Watergate are far behind us so the president was somebody to look up to and admire. Somebody to follow and worship and a position to aspire to. What surprised me about this movie though is that it made the President a normal person. President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a single president, actually a widower. His wife died during his election campaign and this was used successfully to elect him to office. He did not use it because Andrew Shepherd is portrayed as an honest president who loved his wife dearly, but the events that transpired severely hindered the opposition. One day, while debating a bill, an environmental lobbyist decided to speak her mind to the president and this impressed him. He is surrounded by people calling him sir and Mr President: even his best friend refuses to treat him as an equal, and thus he is lonely. He is not a megalomaniac, but rather a president that wants the best for people. He is one that wants to serve the people and not be considered to be too important to talk to normal people. Unfortunately, as president, he cannot escape this. A normal walk down the White House brings marine soldiers saluting him, and he cannot go anywhere without the press following him. He cannot even have a private relationship without the press plastering it all over the papers and the opposition using it against him. The movie is not about the President trying to get this girl, he has her right from the beginning. Rather it deals with the pressures of public life and the problems that they put on the relationship. The real struggles come from the guilt that his girlfriend (Annette Bening) has in regards to the president's daughter, and the fact that people will accuse her of manipulating the president. The greater problem, the one the movie is focused around, it the president struggling with the nature of his private life. He refuses to bring his relationship into the open, nor to defend it, while his opponent is constantly attacking it by dragging up the past. One theme that came through this movie is the realisation of the problems of being president. The major one is the publicity of his private life. The press follows him everywhere and everybody knows what he did with his girlfriend. The first time she spent the night over there, everybody in America knew. Thus I think this movie is an attack against the publicity of some of these lives. It depends on the person  some like to have their lives publicised, while others just can't escape from the press. Generally people do not like the press questioning their activities, especially when they are illegal. In this movie, it is not illegal, but rather private. The American President is a comedy though, but most of the comedy is focused around reactions of normal people to the American President. He has a habit of going out to the people and meeting them face to face. In this movie we laugh at the thing people do when they are nervous, especially when the President rings up. We laugh even more at the way people grovel to him, and their disbelief in the fact that he is personally calling them. This movie forces us to accept the president as a normal person, somebody who loves, hates, and does everything else that we do.

    Out of the 42 individuals who have become presidents two of them, John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson, had wives who died while they were in the White House and who courted and married women who became the second first ladies in their respective administrations. Both Julia Gardiner Tyler and Edith Bolling Galt Wilson were each remarkable first ladies in their own ways and Mrs. Wilson did become a minor issue in her husband's bid for a second term. But none ever engendered the controversy shown here by President Michael Douglas's courtship of Annette Bening. The fictional Douglas is a widower like Tyler and Wilson and he meets and falls hard for an environmental lobbyist. When Bening spends the night in the White House and they do the deed there, their sex lives become campaign fodder for the opposition party in the person of Senate Minority Leader Richard Dreyfuss who is the likely candidate of the opposition. The scenes between Douglas and Bening are quite tastefully done and they show that romance is not beyond the reach of the mature. Of course when you've got smarmy politicians like Dreyfuss ready to make it all sound dirty, sad to say that's all been done before. But when Tyler and Wilson were courting their women you didn't have the mass media and instant communication of today reporting everything down to the latest pelvic thrust. One wonders how things might have turned out for Tyler and Wilson had they had the media attention that President Douglas has in this film. I actually think that Aaron Sorkin might have gotten some inspiration for The American President from Nebraska where back a few years earlier Governor Robert Kerrey was involved with actress Debra Winger. I still remember a certain New York Post columnist named Ray Kerrison getting all kinds of hot and bothered when Winger spent a night in the Governor's mansion in Lincoln, Nebraska the same way Dreyfuss is doing here. What bothered him the most is that no one seemed to care about the horrible moral transgressions being committed in the Governor's mansion. Michael Sheen who would become an American President on a TV series created by Aaron Sorkin and Michael J. Fox are Douglas's two chief staff aides. Shawna Waldron has a nice performance as the President's daughter and she comes over like a real kid and a very unspoiled one at that considering where she's living. The American President is a class and classy drama and you only wish more presidents would act like Douglas and Sheen in their respective fictional presidencies.
