  Wealthy Mary Haines is unaware her husband is having an affair with shopgirl Crystal Allen. Sylvia Fowler and Edith Potter discover this from a manicurist and arrange for Mary to hear the gossip.

While they are at Lucy's dude ranch, Fowler arrives for her own divorce and the Countess meets fifth husband-to-be Buck. Back in New York, Mary's ex is now unhappily married to Crystal who is already in an affair with Buck.

    The groundbreaking gimmick of this vintage George Cukor film is its female-inclusive cast, a bitch-fest orbits around the admiration of their off-screen male counterparts, it is a cornucopia of malicious gossips, cloying feminine bonds, fierce squabbles with vicious innuendos, and culminates with a tit-for-tat machination to win back a man's heart. My tone sounds disparaging, but the film is a hoot to watch, gathering 3 divas, several starlets and many old stagers (all main characters have their respective animal analogs indicate their dispositions before the film starts), Shearer is a worthy leading actress here, notwithstanding the fact that her character is a morally upright woman who may be too perfect to exemplify as a true-to-life impersonation, Shearer's sincerity and grace alone can effortlessly win over audiences' heart and against the grain the magnificence of her id outshines the alter ego on screen and retains the limelight. Crawford is the anti-heroine, a manipulative home-wrecker owns every second during her presence, could be her stock-of-trade by hindsight, but how can one not relish the sparkling confrontations between her and Shearer when words are still able to kill. The last but not the least of the trinity is Russell, a snooty socialite falls into utter caricature, a loudmouth and busybody, oscillates between her chameleon-like affinities (either to Shearer or to Crawford), she might be the most dangerous creature among all the distaff. Then among secondary tier, a drop-dead gorgeous Fontaine is the romantic dreamer, a reverential Boland is the undying love-pursuer, an elegant and witty Goddard is the tactful helper, then a worldly and sensible Watson is the mother who gives appropriate advice when it is needed, and a lovable and juvenile Weidler pulls through an empathetic daughter-mother rapport between her and Shearer. A vivid dissection of vicissitudes on Park Avenue, the film may not be able to be connected to the huddled mass, and its thematic POV "pride is a luxury a woman in love cannot afford" might not be align with today's viewpoint, THE WOMEN still has its unique value in spearheading a paradigm shifting experiment (although ironically women are without exception subordinate to their men in the film) to break the shackles which 74 years later unfortunately is still hedging the film business ubiquitously, not to mention the astonishing fashion-show during the midstream (the only color part in this otherwise monochrome artifact), with a retrospective gaze, everything else is a puff, only haute couture relentlessly lasts!

    There have been plenty of films with an all-male, or almost all-male, cast, but films with an all-female cast are much rarer; in the thirties they were virtually unheard-of. There were, of course, plenty of what were called "women's pictures", aimed at a predominantly female audience and generally with a strong female character in the leading role, but as the theme of such films was normally heterosexual love and relationships there generally had to be men in the cast, if only as secondary characters. "The Women", however, is a "woman's picture" in which man are much discussed but never make an appearance; every single member of the cast is female. Today we tend to think of the Production Code era as being a time when the film industry was dominated by a crippling and oppressive Puritanism, but films like this one remind us that, in America at least, the censors were not as puritanical as we sometimes imagine. I cannot imagine this arch, knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties, but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. &nbsp; The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines, wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one, but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop-girl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know, and so it proves here, but the time-lag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one, largely because she has the sort of "friends" who (in the words of the song) can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldly-wise old mother, who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life, Mary travels to Reno, Nevada, to obtain a divorce. (In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which, despite being liberal in many other matters, has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law; it was the last state to legalise no-fault divorce, as recently as 2010). Stephen marries Crystal, but the marriage is not a happy one and Mary sees her chance to turn the tables on her rival. The role of Mary- the noble, idealistic, long-suffering wronged wife, not unattractive but a bit sexless- seemed ready-made for Norma Shearer, who seemed to specialise in&nbsp;such parts. Joan Crawford tries to make the most of the mercenary, conniving Crystal, but she was really a bit too old for the part. Crawford tended to guard her age as though it were an official secret, but she seems to have been born around 1904, making her about 35 in 1939, only two years or so younger than Shearer. The age-gap between Mary and&nbsp;Crystal needs to be much greater; a dedicated gold- digger like Crystal would doubtless have got her man long before she reached her mid-thirties. When the film was remade in 1956 as "The Opposite Sex" Crystal was played by another "Joan C", Collins, sixteen years younger than June Allyson who played the Mary-figure. "The Women"&nbsp;is often regarded as a great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age, but it is not a film I care for very much. It has some good points; there is occasionally some witty dialogue, Shearer is reasonably good as Mary and the child star Virginia Weidler is enchanting as her young daughter Little Mary. It also, however, has a number of faults. The first is that the decision not to have any male characters was a mistaken gimmick; the makers of "The Opposite Sex" clearly realised this because they altered the plot in order to show Stephen and some of the other men referred to. The mainspring of the plot is, after all, the marriage of Mary and Stephen, and to show only one side of their relationship is to tell only half the story. The second flaw is that the action does not always flow easily. The film is in&nbsp;black-and-white but includes a ten-minute fashion parade filmed in&nbsp;Technicolor, which does not advance the plot at all but slows the action right down. Apparently director George Cukor disliked the sequence and wanted to remove it but was overruled by&nbsp;the studio who evidently felt that female audiences would want to see what the well- dressed woman was wearing that year. Today it has little interest except for the few who care about what the well-dressed woman was wearing more than seventy years ago. At other times, however, it seems that Cukor, perhaps realising that the script contained too much dialogue to be accommodated within the film's running time, had instructed his cast to speak their lines as quickly as possible. The worst, although by no means the only, offender in this regard is the motormouth Rosalind Russell as Mary's bitchy cousin Sylvia. (Russell was to be better in another comedy, "His Girl Friday", the following year). The film's third, and worst, fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a "woman's picture" it is surprisingly misogynistic, embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in "The Women"&nbsp;inhabit the sort of world where nearly all women (Mary being one of the few exceptions) are spiteful, scheming, bitchy, gossipy and&nbsp;backstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman, often her so-called "best friend", who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a "war of the sexes" the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 5/10

    Famed "women's director" George Cukor sure gets his fill in The Woman, a smartly written screwball by Claire Luce and adapted for the screen by Anita Loos that is totally void of men in any role. With a powerhouse cast firing on all cylinders Cukor and the girls do such a fine job you never even miss them, though along with money and high fashion they remain one of the major topics of conversation throughout. Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) is living an enviable existence of a well to do married woman without a care in thee world. A wonderful daughter, perfect husband days filled with shopping and leisure activities until one pampered afternoon a manicurist lets it slip hubby is seeing a perfume counter girl / gold digger Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). While it shakes Mary to her core, the lurid gossip inspires "friend" Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell)to amp things up and rather than attempt reconciliation Mary divorces. At a ranch in Reno the women now joined by Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard to wait out divorces to marry others, in Goddard's case, Fowler's husband and the claws come out. By then Allen has hers completely in Mr. Haines with a wedding ring around one of them. Marriage however has not curtailed Crystals fortune hunter ways. One can only wonder how Cukor handled his temperamental movie queens to show he wasn't favoring the other. Luce's script crackles with sardonic wit and catty commentary that the ladies (especially Crawford and Russell)deliver with almost hisses while noble Shearer soldiers on through degrading gossip. Shearer at the center of the story is fine as the linchpin character in the film allowing the showier characters played with aplomb by Russell and Crawford to feast on her virtue and hurt, heightening their petty villainy. Midway through the already crowded field of fine female performances the film picks up three more from Marie Boland, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main all willing to dispense their take on life and men with acerbic resignation. There's a jarring Technicolor fashion show in this B&W that makes no sense at all and while it arguable that The Women sells out with a Hollywood ending there is no denying that this unique experiment with over a hundred female speaking roles and the complete absence of men is a resounding success. It's a chick flic but men could learn plenty from it.

    Another great film from the 1940's. Rosalind Russell is one of my favorites and is hilarious as the meddling Sylvia. The pace of the movie was rather mixed: seemed overly speedy at first and drawn out toward the end, such as in the fashion show, but each pace served the tone of the scene and held the audience in the right frame of mind. Not only was the movie entertaining, but it had themes relevant to the era that are just as important today. The generational gap is obvious between Mrs. Haines and her mother, and they have opposite views on how to handle infidelity, a frequent subject tackled on the screen. Some of the things about marriage said by the mother remind me of how my grandmother has talked about divorcecertain things simply weren't done, yet are commonplace today, and this movie focuses on a turning point. Touching and funny all in one

    It's a fascinating look into the world of women in all their beauty and loveliness, malevolence and ugliness, wretchedness and wickedness, jealousy and joy, goodness and grace and smarts and sexiness. The acting is great, the dialogue is sharp and the story flows and moves along quite nicely. There's a lot going on, it's a dense and complex film with many facets. It's a canvas in which comments and criticisms on social status, beauty, divorce, jealousy, adultery, fashion and more are shaped. The film accomplishes this in such a way that it sparks a lot of thought and debate, the films story lasts long after the film is over which is why I enjoyed it. It wasn't just a comedy it was socially meaningful and I think it resonates in many ways today. The things portrayed in this film are not ancient nor are they outdated, these values and behaviors are still found in our society and I think this film is a valuable portrait of that.

    I thought this movie was pretty interesting and it showed women in certain point of view from the society that the movie was filmed in. I thought that there was a variety of characters both flat and round. I think the wide number of characters wasn't a problem, it actually made the movie better and stronger. They seemed to be comparing men and women, but yet there was not a single male in the movie. They did show women in a certain way, but they were just showing what women were like in the 1940's. The fashion show was the best scene in the movie if I could say so, it was shown in color. You knew that there was an audience for it because of the clapping,but you could not see them. You could sense tension, love and sadness in all the scenes, especially sadness when Mary told little Mary about the divorce. There was great emotion and love in this scene between the two of them, the camera seemed to focus on their faces and eyes, in that they were crying or very upset.

    This film was very comical, with quick and witty dialog. It was interesting to see a film from this time period that focused mainly on women as the main characters. I found it interesting how Sylvia went about trying to inform Mary about her husband's affair. Rather than telling her herself, she sets Mary up with an appointment with the same manicurist who told her about the affair. The character, Crystal came as a bit of a shock that she was completely unapologetic about the affair she was having with Mary's husband. I've noticed quite a few of the films I've viewed from this era displayed situations of infidelity quite frequently. It was a lot like the Stagecoach in that a group of characters were all different but yet tied in together when Mary met the women on the train to Reno. The ending was a bit of a surprise and brought justice to the women who were all in unfortunate situations due to one girl.

    Some of Hollywood's classic films age better than others. One would have expected THE WOMEN, with its depiction of upper-class wives as basically parasites who live off their husbands (and the alimony checks after the divorce), to have faded into oblivion years ago. That it has not is a tribute to director George Cukor, writers Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos (and some sources say an uncredited F Scott Fitzgerald, among others), and a stellar cast of the biggest female stars in MGM's galaxy. Somehow, getting past the basic premise, which should have dated badly but somehow has not, is fairly easy, mainly because this movie is just so much fun. From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing: Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily. Crawford only won one Oscar in her career, as the noble, self-sacrificing mother in MILDRED PIERCE, and her biographers have suggested that the Mildred role was how she saw herself, but I always liked her the best when she played a broad on the make, as in GRAND HOTEL and in this, possibly her best film role, and one which gave her one of the best exit lines ever written (see above). A lot has been said and written about the "sexist" nature of this film and the play upon which it was based, but Luce was writing of people she knew, and in those days a man who made or had serious money took care of his wife during their marriage and even after, so the film works, even today, I think, as a great comedy of manners that brilliantly spoofs upper class women with too much time on their hands and not enough scruples or ambition to actually DO anything themselves. I love this movie. Yes, it is sexist, and no, it could never work today (I know they remade it but I refuse to see it; the very idea is preposterous), but thanks to Cukor's skill in handling a cast that had not one man in the mix, THE WOMEN remains a classic comedy of manners with dialogue that will never go out of style.

    Now here's a movie that surprised me. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.

    The Women was a very interesting film, I wasn't very sold with it at first it was hard to focus on because so many things were going on, women were busy everywhere doing strange things, and they were talking a mile a minute. When things settled down I began to realize that it was doing a fantastic job of portraying the lives of well women. I think it's funny that you don't see a man in the ENTIRE film, not even the infamous "Stephen" Mary's husband. That actually made me laugh. All the women characters were quite good, none of them compare to Mary Haines of course. I loved Mary, she was fantastic, she was a sweetheart like everyone said throughout the movie, at first she seemed like someone to feel sorry for, but then you saw how strong she was and clever, that your sympathy turned to cheery as you waited to see Mary win in the end. I think the thing about her that impressed me the most, was how good of a mother she was at all times! Over all a good film.

(Russell was to be better in another comedy, "His Girl Friday", the following year). The film's third, and worst, fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a "woman's picture" it is surprisingly misogynistic, embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in "The Women"&nbsp;inhabit the sort of world where nearly all women (Mary being one of the few exceptions) are spiteful, scheming, bitchy, gossipy and&nbsp;backstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman, often her so-called "best friend", who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a "war of the sexes" the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 5/10

    Famed "women's director" George Cukor sure gets his fill in The Woman, a smartly written screwball by Claire Luce and adapted for the screen by Anita Loos that is totally void of men in any role. With a powerhouse cast firing on all cylinders Cukor and the girls do such a fine job you never even miss them, though along with money and high fashion they remain one of the major topics of conversation throughout. Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) is living an enviable existence of a well to do married woman without a care in thee world. A wonderful daughter, perfect husband days filled with shopping and leisure activities until one pampered afternoon a manicurist lets it slip hubby is seeing a perfume counter girl / gold digger Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). While it shakes Mary to her core, the lurid gossip inspires "friend" Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell)to amp things up and rather than attempt reconciliation Mary divorces. At a ranch in Reno the women now joined by Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard to wait out divorces to marry others, in Goddard's case, Fowler's husband and the claws come out. By then Allen has hers completely in Mr. Haines with a wedding ring around one of them. Marriage however has not curtailed Crystals fortune hunter ways. One can only wonder how Cukor handled his temperamental movie queens to show he wasn't favoring the other. Luce's script crackles with sardonic wit and catty commentary that the ladies (especially Crawford and Russell)deliver with almost hisses while noble Shearer soldiers on through degrading gossip. Shearer at the center of the story is fine as the linchpin character in the film allowing the showier characters played with aplomb by Russell and Crawford to feast on her virtue and hurt, heightening their petty villainy. Midway through the already crowded field of fine female performances the film picks up three more from Marie Boland, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main all willing to dispense their take on life and men with acerbic resignation. There's a jarring Technicolor fashion show in this B&W that makes no sense at all and while it arguable that The Women sells out with a Hollywood ending there is no denying that this unique experiment with over a hundred female speaking roles and the complete absence of men is a resounding success. It's a chick flic but men could learn plenty from it.

    Another great film from the 1940's. Rosalind Russell is one of my favorites and is hilarious as the meddling Sylvia. The pace of the movie was rather mixed: seemed overly speedy at first and drawn out toward the end, such as in the fashion show, but each pace served the tone of the scene and held the audience in the right frame of mind. Not only was the movie entertaining, but it had themes relevant to the era that are just as important today. The generational gap is obvious between Mrs. Haines and her mother, and they have opposite views on how to handle infidelity, a frequent subject tackled on the screen. Some of the things about marriage said by the mother remind me of how my grandmother has talked about divorcecertain things simply weren't done, yet are commonplace today, and this movie focuses on a turning point. Touching and funny all in one

    It's a fascinating look into the world of women in all their beauty and loveliness, malevolence and ugliness, wretchedness and wickedness, jealousy and joy, goodness and grace and smarts and sexiness. The acting is great, the dialogue is sharp and the story flows and moves along quite nicely. There's a lot going on, it's a dense and complex film with many facets. It's a canvas in which comments and criticisms on social status, beauty, divorce, jealousy, adultery, fashion and more are shaped. The film accomplishes this in such a way that it sparks a lot of thought and debate, the films story lasts long after the film is over which is why I enjoyed it. It wasn't just a comedy it was socially meaningful and I think it resonates in many ways today. The things portrayed in this film are not ancient nor are they outdated, these values and behaviors are still found in our society and I think this film is a valuable portrait of that.

    I thought this movie was pretty interesting and it showed women in certain point of view from the society that the movie was filmed in. I thought that there was a variety of characters both flat and round. I think the wide number of characters wasn't a problem, it actually made the movie better and stronger. They seemed to be comparing men and women, but yet there was not a single male in the movie. They did show women in a certain way, but they were just showing what women were like in the 1940's. The fashion show was the best scene in the movie if I could say so, it was shown in color. You knew that there was an audience for it because of the clapping,but you could not see them. You could sense tension, love and sadness in all the scenes, especially sadness when Mary told little Mary about the divorce. There was great emotion and love in this scene between the two of them, the camera seemed to focus on their faces and eyes, in that they were crying or very upset.

    This film was very comical, with quick and witty dialog. It was interesting to see a film from this time period that focused mainly on women as the main characters. I found it interesting how Sylvia went about trying to inform Mary about her husband's affair. Rather than telling her herself, she sets Mary up with an appointment with the same manicurist who told her about the affair. The character, Crystal came as a bit of a shock that she was completely unapologetic about the affair she was having with Mary's husband. I've noticed quite a few of the films I've viewed from this era displayed situations of infidelity quite frequently. It was a lot like the Stagecoach in that a group of characters were all different but yet tied in together when Mary met the women on the train to Reno. The ending was a bit of a surprise and brought justice to the women who were all in unfortunate situations due to one girl.

    Some of Hollywood's classic films age better than others. One would have expected THE WOMEN, with its depiction of upper-class wives as basically parasites who live off their husbands (and the alimony checks after the divorce), to have faded into oblivion years ago. That it has not is a tribute to director George Cukor, writers Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos (and some sources say an uncredited F Scott Fitzgerald, among others), and a stellar cast of the biggest female stars in MGM's galaxy. Somehow, getting past the basic premise, which should have dated badly but somehow has not, is fairly easy, mainly because this movie is just so much fun. From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing: Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily. Crawford only won one Oscar in her career, as the noble, self-sacrificing mother in MILDRED PIERCE, and her biographers have suggested that the Mildred role was how she saw herself, but I always liked her the best when she played a broad on the make, as in GRAND HOTEL and in this, possibly her best film role, and one which gave her one of the best exit lines ever written (see above). A lot has been said and written about the "sexist" nature of this film and the play upon which it was based, but Luce was writing of people she knew, and in those days a man who made or had serious money took care of his wife during their marriage and even after, so the film works, even today, I think, as a great comedy of manners that brilliantly spoofs upper class women with too much time on their hands and not enough scruples or ambition to actually DO anything themselves. I love this movie. Yes, it is sexist, and no, it could never work today (I know they remade it but I refuse to see it; the very idea is preposterous), but thanks to Cukor's skill in handling a cast that had not one man in the mix, THE WOMEN remains a classic comedy of manners with dialogue that will never go out of style.

    Now here's a movie that surprised me. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.

    The Women was a very interesting film, I wasn't very sold with it at first it was hard to focus on because so many things were going on, women were busy everywhere doing strange things, and they were talking a mile a minute. When things settled down I began to realize that it was doing a fantastic job of portraying the lives of well women. I think it's funny that you don't see a man in the ENTIRE film, not even the infamous "Stephen" Mary's husband. That actually made me laugh. All the women characters were quite good, none of them compare to Mary Haines of course. I loved Mary, she was fantastic, she was a sweetheart like everyone said throughout the movie, at first she seemed like someone to feel sorry for, but then you saw how strong she was and clever, that your sympathy turned to cheery as you waited to see Mary win in the end. I think the thing about her that impressed me the most, was how good of a mother she was at all times! Over all a good film.

    The groundbreaking gimmick of this vintage George Cukor film is its female-inclusive cast, a bitch-fest orbits around the admiration of their off-screen male counterparts, it is a cornucopia of malicious gossips, cloying feminine bonds, fierce squabbles with vicious innuendos, and culminates with a tit-for-tat machination to win back a man's heart. My tone sounds disparaging, but the film is a hoot to watch, gathering 3 divas, several starlets and many old stagers (all main characters have their respective animal analogs indicate their dispositions before the film starts), Shearer is a worthy leading actress here, notwithstanding the fact that her character is a morally upright woman who may be too perfect to exemplify as a true-to-life impersonation, Shearer's sincerity and grace alone can effortlessly win over audiences' heart and against the grain the magnificence of her id outshines the alter ego on screen and retains the limelight. Crawford is the anti-heroine, a manipulative home-wrecker owns every second during her presence, could be her stock-of-trade by hindsight, but how can one not relish the sparkling confrontations between her and Shearer when words are still able to kill. The last but not the least of the trinity is Russell, a snooty socialite falls into utter caricature, a loudmouth and busybody, oscillates between her chameleon-like affinities (either to Shearer or to Crawford), she might be the most dangerous creature among all the distaff. Then among secondary tier, a drop-dead gorgeous Fontaine is the romantic dreamer, a reverential Boland is the undying love-pursuer, an elegant and witty Goddard is the tactful helper, then a worldly and sensible Watson is the mother who gives appropriate advice when it is needed, and a lovable and juvenile Weidler pulls through an empathetic daughter-mother rapport between her and Shearer. A vivid dissection of vicissitudes on Park Avenue, the film may not be able to be connected to the huddled mass, and its thematic POV "pride is a luxury a woman in love cannot afford" might not be align with today's viewpoint, THE WOMEN still has its unique value in spearheading a paradigm shifting experiment (although ironically women are without exception subordinate to their men in the film) to break the shackles which 74 years later unfortunately is still hedging the film business ubiquitously, not to mention the astonishing fashion-show during the midstream (the only color part in this otherwise monochrome artifact), with a retrospective gaze, everything else is a puff, only haute couture relentlessly lasts!

    There have been plenty of films with an all-male, or almost all-male, cast, but films with an all-female cast are much rarer; in the thirties they were virtually unheard-of. There were, of course, plenty of what were called "women's pictures", aimed at a predominantly female audience and generally with a strong female character in the leading role, but as the theme of such films was normally heterosexual love and relationships there generally had to be men in the cast, if only as secondary characters. "The Women", however, is a "woman's picture" in which man are much discussed but never make an appearance; every single member of the cast is female. Today we tend to think of the Production Code era as being a time when the film industry was dominated by a crippling and oppressive Puritanism, but films like this one remind us that, in America at least, the censors were not as puritanical as we sometimes imagine. I cannot imagine this arch, knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties, but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. &nbsp; The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines, wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one, but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop-girl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know, and so it proves here, but the time-lag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one, largely because she has the sort of "friends" who (in the words of the song) can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldly-wise old mother, who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life, Mary travels to Reno, Nevada, to obtain a divorce. (In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which, despite being liberal in many other matters, has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law; it was the last state to legalise no-fault divorce, as recently as 2010). Stephen marries Crystal, but the marriage is not a happy one and Mary sees her chance to turn the tables on her rival. The role of Mary- the noble, idealistic, long-suffering wronged wife, not unattractive but a bit sexless- seemed ready-made for Norma Shearer, who seemed to specialise in&nbsp;such parts. Joan Crawford tries to make the most of the mercenary, conniving Crystal, but she was really a bit too old for the part. Crawford tended to guard her age as though it were an official secret, but she seems to have been born around 1904, making her about 35 in 1939, only two years or so younger than Shearer. The age-gap between Mary and&nbsp;Crystal needs to be much greater; a dedicated gold- digger like Crystal would doubtless have got her man long before she reached her mid-thirties. When the film was remade in 1956 as "The Opposite Sex" Crystal was played by another "Joan C", Collins, sixteen years younger than June Allyson who played the Mary-figure. "The Women"&nbsp;is often regarded as a great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age, but it is not a film I care for very much. It has some good points; there is occasionally some witty dialogue, Shearer is reasonably good as Mary and the child star Virginia Weidler is enchanting as her young daughter Little Mary. It also, however, has a number of faults. The first is that the decision not to have any male characters was a mistaken gimmick; the makers of "The Opposite Sex" clearly realised this because they altered the plot in order to show Stephen and some of the other men referred to. The mainspring of the plot is, after all, the marriage of Mary and Stephen, and to show only one side of their relationship is to tell only half the story. The second flaw is that the action does not always flow easily. The film is in&nbsp;black-and-white but includes a ten-minute fashion parade filmed in&nbsp;Technicolor, which does not advance the plot at all but slows the action right down. Apparently director George Cukor disliked the sequence and wanted to remove it but was overruled by&nbsp;the studio who evidently felt that female audiences would want to see what the well- dressed woman was wearing that year. Today it has little interest except for the few who care about what the well-dressed woman was wearing more than seventy years ago. At other times, however, it seems that Cukor, perhaps realising that the script contained too much dialogue to be accommodated within the film's running time, had instructed his cast to speak their lines as quickly as possible. The worst, although by no means the only, offender in this regard is the motormouth Rosalind Russell as Mary's bitchy cousin Sylvia. (Russell was to be better in another comedy, "His Girl Friday", the following year). The film's third, and worst, fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a "woman's picture" it is surprisingly misogynistic, embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in "The Women"&nbsp;inhabit the sort of world where nearly all women (Mary being one of the few exceptions) are spiteful, scheming, bitchy, gossipy and&nbsp;backstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman, often her so-called "best friend", who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a "war of the sexes" the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 5/10

From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing: Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily. Crawford only won one Oscar in her career, as the noble, self-sacrificing mother in MILDRED PIERCE, and her biographers have suggested that the Mildred role was how she saw herself, but I always liked her the best when she played a broad on the make, as in GRAND HOTEL and in this, possibly her best film role, and one which gave her one of the best exit lines ever written (see above). A lot has been said and written about the "sexist" nature of this film and the play upon which it was based, but Luce was writing of people she knew, and in those days a man who made or had serious money took care of his wife during their marriage and even after, so the film works, even today, I think, as a great comedy of manners that brilliantly spoofs upper class women with too much time on their hands and not enough scruples or ambition to actually DO anything themselves. I love this movie. Yes, it is sexist, and no, it could never work today (I know they remade it but I refuse to see it; the very idea is preposterous), but thanks to Cukor's skill in handling a cast that had not one man in the mix, THE WOMEN remains a classic comedy of manners with dialogue that will never go out of style.

    Now here's a movie that surprised me. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.

    The Women was a very interesting film, I wasn't very sold with it at first it was hard to focus on because so many things were going on, women were busy everywhere doing strange things, and they were talking a mile a minute. When things settled down I began to realize that it was doing a fantastic job of portraying the lives of well women. I think it's funny that you don't see a man in the ENTIRE film, not even the infamous "Stephen" Mary's husband. That actually made me laugh. All the women characters were quite good, none of them compare to Mary Haines of course. I loved Mary, she was fantastic, she was a sweetheart like everyone said throughout the movie, at first she seemed like someone to feel sorry for, but then you saw how strong she was and clever, that your sympathy turned to cheery as you waited to see Mary win in the end. I think the thing about her that impressed me the most, was how good of a mother she was at all times! Over all a good film.

    The groundbreaking gimmick of this vintage George Cukor film is its female-inclusive cast, a bitch-fest orbits around the admiration of their off-screen male counterparts, it is a cornucopia of malicious gossips, cloying feminine bonds, fierce squabbles with vicious innuendos, and culminates with a tit-for-tat machination to win back a man's heart. My tone sounds disparaging, but the film is a hoot to watch, gathering 3 divas, several starlets and many old stagers (all main characters have their respective animal analogs indicate their dispositions before the film starts), Shearer is a worthy leading actress here, notwithstanding the fact that her character is a morally upright woman who may be too perfect to exemplify as a true-to-life impersonation, Shearer's sincerity and grace alone can effortlessly win over audiences' heart and against the grain the magnificence of her id outshines the alter ego on screen and retains the limelight. Crawford is the anti-heroine, a manipulative home-wrecker owns every second during her presence, could be her stock-of-trade by hindsight, but how can one not relish the sparkling confrontations between her and Shearer when words are still able to kill. The last but not the least of the trinity is Russell, a snooty socialite falls into utter caricature, a loudmouth and busybody, oscillates between her chameleon-like affinities (either to Shearer or to Crawford), she might be the most dangerous creature among all the distaff. Then among secondary tier, a drop-dead gorgeous Fontaine is the romantic dreamer, a reverential Boland is the undying love-pursuer, an elegant and witty Goddard is the tactful helper, then a worldly and sensible Watson is the mother who gives appropriate advice when it is needed, and a lovable and juvenile Weidler pulls through an empathetic daughter-mother rapport between her and Shearer. A vivid dissection of vicissitudes on Park Avenue, the film may not be able to be connected to the huddled mass, and its thematic POV "pride is a luxury a woman in love cannot afford" might not be align with today's viewpoint, THE WOMEN still has its unique value in spearheading a paradigm shifting experiment (although ironically women are without exception subordinate to their men in the film) to break the shackles which 74 years later unfortunately is still hedging the film business ubiquitously, not to mention the astonishing fashion-show during the midstream (the only color part in this otherwise monochrome artifact), with a retrospective gaze, everything else is a puff, only haute couture relentlessly lasts!

    There have been plenty of films with an all-male, or almost all-male, cast, but films with an all-female cast are much rarer; in the thirties they were virtually unheard-of. There were, of course, plenty of what were called "women's pictures", aimed at a predominantly female audience and generally with a strong female character in the leading role, but as the theme of such films was normally heterosexual love and relationships there generally had to be men in the cast, if only as secondary characters. "The Women", however, is a "woman's picture" in which man are much discussed but never make an appearance; every single member of the cast is female. Today we tend to think of the Production Code era as being a time when the film industry was dominated by a crippling and oppressive Puritanism, but films like this one remind us that, in America at least, the censors were not as puritanical as we sometimes imagine. I cannot imagine this arch, knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties, but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. &nbsp; The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines, wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one, but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop-girl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know, and so it proves here, but the time-lag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one, largely because she has the sort of "friends" who (in the words of the song) can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldly-wise old mother, who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life, Mary travels to Reno, Nevada, to obtain a divorce. (In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which, despite being liberal in many other matters, has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law; it was the last state to legalise no-fault divorce, as recently as 2010). Stephen marries Crystal, but the marriage is not a happy one and Mary sees her chance to turn the tables on her rival. The role of Mary- the noble, idealistic, long-suffering wronged wife, not unattractive but a bit sexless- seemed ready-made for Norma Shearer, who seemed to specialise in&nbsp;such parts. Joan Crawford tries to make the most of the mercenary, conniving Crystal, but she was really a bit too old for the part. Crawford tended to guard her age as though it were an official secret, but she seems to have been born around 1904, making her about 35 in 1939, only two years or so younger than Shearer. The age-gap between Mary and&nbsp;Crystal needs to be much greater; a dedicated gold- digger like Crystal would doubtless have got her man long before she reached her mid-thirties. When the film was remade in 1956 as "The Opposite Sex" Crystal was played by another "Joan C", Collins, sixteen years younger than June Allyson who played the Mary-figure. "The Women"&nbsp;is often regarded as a great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age, but it is not a film I care for very much. It has some good points; there is occasionally some witty dialogue, Shearer is reasonably good as Mary and the child star Virginia Weidler is enchanting as her young daughter Little Mary. It also, however, has a number of faults. The first is that the decision not to have any male characters was a mistaken gimmick; the makers of "The Opposite Sex" clearly realised this because they altered the plot in order to show Stephen and some of the other men referred to. The mainspring of the plot is, after all, the marriage of Mary and Stephen, and to show only one side of their relationship is to tell only half the story. The second flaw is that the action does not always flow easily. The film is in&nbsp;black-and-white but includes a ten-minute fashion parade filmed in&nbsp;Technicolor, which does not advance the plot at all but slows the action right down. Apparently director George Cukor disliked the sequence and wanted to remove it but was overruled by&nbsp;the studio who evidently felt that female audiences would want to see what the well- dressed woman was wearing that year. Today it has little interest except for the few who care about what the well-dressed woman was wearing more than seventy years ago. At other times, however, it seems that Cukor, perhaps realising that the script contained too much dialogue to be accommodated within the film's running time, had instructed his cast to speak their lines as quickly as possible. The worst, although by no means the only, offender in this regard is the motormouth Rosalind Russell as Mary's bitchy cousin Sylvia. (Russell was to be better in another comedy, "His Girl Friday", the following year). The film's third, and worst, fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a "woman's picture" it is surprisingly misogynistic, embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in "The Women"&nbsp;inhabit the sort of world where nearly all women (Mary being one of the few exceptions) are spiteful, scheming, bitchy, gossipy and&nbsp;backstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman, often her so-called "best friend", who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a "war of the sexes" the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 5/10

    Famed "women's director" George Cukor sure gets his fill in The Woman, a smartly written screwball by Claire Luce and adapted for the screen by Anita Loos that is totally void of men in any role. With a powerhouse cast firing on all cylinders Cukor and the girls do such a fine job you never even miss them, though along with money and high fashion they remain one of the major topics of conversation throughout. Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) is living an enviable existence of a well to do married woman without a care in thee world. A wonderful daughter, perfect husband days filled with shopping and leisure activities until one pampered afternoon a manicurist lets it slip hubby is seeing a perfume counter girl / gold digger Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). While it shakes Mary to her core, the lurid gossip inspires "friend" Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell)to amp things up and rather than attempt reconciliation Mary divorces. At a ranch in Reno the women now joined by Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard to wait out divorces to marry others, in Goddard's case, Fowler's husband and the claws come out. By then Allen has hers completely in Mr. Haines with a wedding ring around one of them. Marriage however has not curtailed Crystals fortune hunter ways. One can only wonder how Cukor handled his temperamental movie queens to show he wasn't favoring the other. Luce's script crackles with sardonic wit and catty commentary that the ladies (especially Crawford and Russell)deliver with almost hisses while noble Shearer soldiers on through degrading gossip. Shearer at the center of the story is fine as the linchpin character in the film allowing the showier characters played with aplomb by Russell and Crawford to feast on her virtue and hurt, heightening their petty villainy. Midway through the already crowded field of fine female performances the film picks up three more from Marie Boland, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main all willing to dispense their take on life and men with acerbic resignation. There's a jarring Technicolor fashion show in this B&W that makes no sense at all and while it arguable that The Women sells out with a Hollywood ending there is no denying that this unique experiment with over a hundred female speaking roles and the complete absence of men is a resounding success. It's a chick flic but men could learn plenty from it.

    Another great film from the 1940's. Rosalind Russell is one of my favorites and is hilarious as the meddling Sylvia. The pace of the movie was rather mixed: seemed overly speedy at first and drawn out toward the end, such as in the fashion show, but each pace served the tone of the scene and held the audience in the right frame of mind. Not only was the movie entertaining, but it had themes relevant to the era that are just as important today. The generational gap is obvious between Mrs. Haines and her mother, and they have opposite views on how to handle infidelity, a frequent subject tackled on the screen. Some of the things about marriage said by the mother remind me of how my grandmother has talked about divorcecertain things simply weren't done, yet are commonplace today, and this movie focuses on a turning point. Touching and funny all in one

    It's a fascinating look into the world of women in all their beauty and loveliness, malevolence and ugliness, wretchedness and wickedness, jealousy and joy, goodness and grace and smarts and sexiness. The acting is great, the dialogue is sharp and the story flows and moves along quite nicely. There's a lot going on, it's a dense and complex film with many facets. It's a canvas in which comments and criticisms on social status, beauty, divorce, jealousy, adultery, fashion and more are shaped. The film accomplishes this in such a way that it sparks a lot of thought and debate, the films story lasts long after the film is over which is why I enjoyed it. It wasn't just a comedy it was socially meaningful and I think it resonates in many ways today. The things portrayed in this film are not ancient nor are they outdated, these values and behaviors are still found in our society and I think this film is a valuable portrait of that.

    I thought this movie was pretty interesting and it showed women in certain point of view from the society that the movie was filmed in. I thought that there was a variety of characters both flat and round. I think the wide number of characters wasn't a problem, it actually made the movie better and stronger. They seemed to be comparing men and women, but yet there was not a single male in the movie. They did show women in a certain way, but they were just showing what women were like in the 1940's. The fashion show was the best scene in the movie if I could say so, it was shown in color. You knew that there was an audience for it because of the clapping,but you could not see them. You could sense tension, love and sadness in all the scenes, especially sadness when Mary told little Mary about the divorce. There was great emotion and love in this scene between the two of them, the camera seemed to focus on their faces and eyes, in that they were crying or very upset.

    This film was very comical, with quick and witty dialog. It was interesting to see a film from this time period that focused mainly on women as the main characters. I found it interesting how Sylvia went about trying to inform Mary about her husband's affair. Rather than telling her herself, she sets Mary up with an appointment with the same manicurist who told her about the affair. The character, Crystal came as a bit of a shock that she was completely unapologetic about the affair she was having with Mary's husband. I've noticed quite a few of the films I've viewed from this era displayed situations of infidelity quite frequently. It was a lot like the Stagecoach in that a group of characters were all different but yet tied in together when Mary met the women on the train to Reno. The ending was a bit of a surprise and brought justice to the women who were all in unfortunate situations due to one girl.

    Some of Hollywood's classic films age better than others. One would have expected THE WOMEN, with its depiction of upper-class wives as basically parasites who live off their husbands (and the alimony checks after the divorce), to have faded into oblivion years ago. That it has not is a tribute to director George Cukor, writers Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos (and some sources say an uncredited F Scott Fitzgerald, among others), and a stellar cast of the biggest female stars in MGM's galaxy. Somehow, getting past the basic premise, which should have dated badly but somehow has not, is fairly easy, mainly because this movie is just so much fun. From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing: Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily.

I cannot imagine this arch, knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties, but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. &nbsp; The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines, wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one, but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop-girl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know, and so it proves here, but the time-lag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one, largely because she has the sort of "friends" who (in the words of the song) can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldly-wise old mother, who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life, Mary travels to Reno, Nevada, to obtain a divorce. (In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which, despite being liberal in many other matters, has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law; it was the last state to legalise no-fault divorce, as recently as 2010). Stephen marries Crystal, but the marriage is not a happy one and Mary sees her chance to turn the tables on her rival. The role of Mary- the noble, idealistic, long-suffering wronged wife, not unattractive but a bit sexless- seemed ready-made for Norma Shearer, who seemed to specialise in&nbsp;such parts. Joan Crawford tries to make the most of the mercenary, conniving Crystal, but she was really a bit too old for the part. Crawford tended to guard her age as though it were an official secret, but she seems to have been born around 1904, making her about 35 in 1939, only two years or so younger than Shearer. The age-gap between Mary and&nbsp;Crystal needs to be much greater; a dedicated gold- digger like Crystal would doubtless have got her man long before she reached her mid-thirties. When the film was remade in 1956 as "The Opposite Sex" Crystal was played by another "Joan C", Collins, sixteen years younger than June Allyson who played the Mary-figure. "The Women"&nbsp;is often regarded as a great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age, but it is not a film I care for very much. It has some good points; there is occasionally some witty dialogue, Shearer is reasonably good as Mary and the child star Virginia Weidler is enchanting as her young daughter Little Mary. It also, however, has a number of faults. The first is that the decision not to have any male characters was a mistaken gimmick; the makers of "The Opposite Sex" clearly realised this because they altered the plot in order to show Stephen and some of the other men referred to. The mainspring of the plot is, after all, the marriage of Mary and Stephen, and to show only one side of their relationship is to tell only half the story. The second flaw is that the action does not always flow easily. The film is in&nbsp;black-and-white but includes a ten-minute fashion parade filmed in&nbsp;Technicolor, which does not advance the plot at all but slows the action right down. Apparently director George Cukor disliked the sequence and wanted to remove it but was overruled by&nbsp;the studio who evidently felt that female audiences would want to see what the well- dressed woman was wearing that year. Today it has little interest except for the few who care about what the well-dressed woman was wearing more than seventy years ago. At other times, however, it seems that Cukor, perhaps realising that the script contained too much dialogue to be accommodated within the film's running time, had instructed his cast to speak their lines as quickly as possible. The worst, although by no means the only, offender in this regard is the motormouth Rosalind Russell as Mary's bitchy cousin Sylvia. (Russell was to be better in another comedy, "His Girl Friday", the following year). The film's third, and worst, fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a "woman's picture" it is surprisingly misogynistic, embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in "The Women"&nbsp;inhabit the sort of world where nearly all women (Mary being one of the few exceptions) are spiteful, scheming, bitchy, gossipy and&nbsp;backstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman, often her so-called "best friend", who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a "war of the sexes" the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 5/10

    Famed "women's director" George Cukor sure gets his fill in The Woman, a smartly written screwball by Claire Luce and adapted for the screen by Anita Loos that is totally void of men in any role. With a powerhouse cast firing on all cylinders Cukor and the girls do such a fine job you never even miss them, though along with money and high fashion they remain one of the major topics of conversation throughout. Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) is living an enviable existence of a well to do married woman without a care in thee world. A wonderful daughter, perfect husband days filled with shopping and leisure activities until one pampered afternoon a manicurist lets it slip hubby is seeing a perfume counter girl / gold digger Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). While it shakes Mary to her core, the lurid gossip inspires "friend" Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell)to amp things up and rather than attempt reconciliation Mary divorces. At a ranch in Reno the women now joined by Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard to wait out divorces to marry others, in Goddard's case, Fowler's husband and the claws come out. By then Allen has hers completely in Mr. Haines with a wedding ring around one of them. Marriage however has not curtailed Crystals fortune hunter ways. One can only wonder how Cukor handled his temperamental movie queens to show he wasn't favoring the other. Luce's script crackles with sardonic wit and catty commentary that the ladies (especially Crawford and Russell)deliver with almost hisses while noble Shearer soldiers on through degrading gossip. Shearer at the center of the story is fine as the linchpin character in the film allowing the showier characters played with aplomb by Russell and Crawford to feast on her virtue and hurt, heightening their petty villainy. Midway through the already crowded field of fine female performances the film picks up three more from Marie Boland, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main all willing to dispense their take on life and men with acerbic resignation. There's a jarring Technicolor fashion show in this B&W that makes no sense at all and while it arguable that The Women sells out with a Hollywood ending there is no denying that this unique experiment with over a hundred female speaking roles and the complete absence of men is a resounding success. It's a chick flic but men could learn plenty from it.

    Another great film from the 1940's. Rosalind Russell is one of my favorites and is hilarious as the meddling Sylvia. The pace of the movie was rather mixed: seemed overly speedy at first and drawn out toward the end, such as in the fashion show, but each pace served the tone of the scene and held the audience in the right frame of mind. Not only was the movie entertaining, but it had themes relevant to the era that are just as important today. The generational gap is obvious between Mrs. Haines and her mother, and they have opposite views on how to handle infidelity, a frequent subject tackled on the screen. Some of the things about marriage said by the mother remind me of how my grandmother has talked about divorcecertain things simply weren't done, yet are commonplace today, and this movie focuses on a turning point. Touching and funny all in one

    It's a fascinating look into the world of women in all their beauty and loveliness, malevolence and ugliness, wretchedness and wickedness, jealousy and joy, goodness and grace and smarts and sexiness. The acting is great, the dialogue is sharp and the story flows and moves along quite nicely. There's a lot going on, it's a dense and complex film with many facets. It's a canvas in which comments and criticisms on social status, beauty, divorce, jealousy, adultery, fashion and more are shaped. The film accomplishes this in such a way that it sparks a lot of thought and debate, the films story lasts long after the film is over which is why I enjoyed it. It wasn't just a comedy it was socially meaningful and I think it resonates in many ways today. The things portrayed in this film are not ancient nor are they outdated, these values and behaviors are still found in our society and I think this film is a valuable portrait of that.

    I thought this movie was pretty interesting and it showed women in certain point of view from the society that the movie was filmed in. I thought that there was a variety of characters both flat and round. I think the wide number of characters wasn't a problem, it actually made the movie better and stronger. They seemed to be comparing men and women, but yet there was not a single male in the movie. They did show women in a certain way, but they were just showing what women were like in the 1940's. The fashion show was the best scene in the movie if I could say so, it was shown in color. You knew that there was an audience for it because of the clapping,but you could not see them. You could sense tension, love and sadness in all the scenes, especially sadness when Mary told little Mary about the divorce. There was great emotion and love in this scene between the two of them, the camera seemed to focus on their faces and eyes, in that they were crying or very upset.

    This film was very comical, with quick and witty dialog. It was interesting to see a film from this time period that focused mainly on women as the main characters. I found it interesting how Sylvia went about trying to inform Mary about her husband's affair. Rather than telling her herself, she sets Mary up with an appointment with the same manicurist who told her about the affair. The character, Crystal came as a bit of a shock that she was completely unapologetic about the affair she was having with Mary's husband. I've noticed quite a few of the films I've viewed from this era displayed situations of infidelity quite frequently. It was a lot like the Stagecoach in that a group of characters were all different but yet tied in together when Mary met the women on the train to Reno. The ending was a bit of a surprise and brought justice to the women who were all in unfortunate situations due to one girl.

    Some of Hollywood's classic films age better than others. One would have expected THE WOMEN, with its depiction of upper-class wives as basically parasites who live off their husbands (and the alimony checks after the divorce), to have faded into oblivion years ago. That it has not is a tribute to director George Cukor, writers Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos (and some sources say an uncredited F Scott Fitzgerald, among others), and a stellar cast of the biggest female stars in MGM's galaxy. Somehow, getting past the basic premise, which should have dated badly but somehow has not, is fairly easy, mainly because this movie is just so much fun. From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing: Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily. Crawford only won one Oscar in her career, as the noble, self-sacrificing mother in MILDRED PIERCE, and her biographers have suggested that the Mildred role was how she saw herself, but I always liked her the best when she played a broad on the make, as in GRAND HOTEL and in this, possibly her best film role, and one which gave her one of the best exit lines ever written (see above). A lot has been said and written about the "sexist" nature of this film and the play upon which it was based, but Luce was writing of people she knew, and in those days a man who made or had serious money took care of his wife during their marriage and even after, so the film works, even today, I think, as a great comedy of manners that brilliantly spoofs upper class women with too much time on their hands and not enough scruples or ambition to actually DO anything themselves. I love this movie. Yes, it is sexist, and no, it could never work today (I know they remade it but I refuse to see it; the very idea is preposterous), but thanks to Cukor's skill in handling a cast that had not one man in the mix, THE WOMEN remains a classic comedy of manners with dialogue that will never go out of style.

    Now here's a movie that surprised me. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.

    The Women was a very interesting film, I wasn't very sold with it at first it was hard to focus on because so many things were going on, women were busy everywhere doing strange things, and they were talking a mile a minute. When things settled down I began to realize that it was doing a fantastic job of portraying the lives of well women. I think it's funny that you don't see a man in the ENTIRE film, not even the infamous "Stephen" Mary's husband. That actually made me laugh. All the women characters were quite good, none of them compare to Mary Haines of course. I loved Mary, she was fantastic, she was a sweetheart like everyone said throughout the movie, at first she seemed like someone to feel sorry for, but then you saw how strong she was and clever, that your sympathy turned to cheery as you waited to see Mary win in the end. I think the thing about her that impressed me the most, was how good of a mother she was at all times! Over all a good film.

    The groundbreaking gimmick of this vintage George Cukor film is its female-inclusive cast, a bitch-fest orbits around the admiration of their off-screen male counterparts, it is a cornucopia of malicious gossips, cloying feminine bonds, fierce squabbles with vicious innuendos, and culminates with a tit-for-tat machination to win back a man's heart. My tone sounds disparaging, but the film is a hoot to watch, gathering 3 divas, several starlets and many old stagers (all main characters have their respective animal analogs indicate their dispositions before the film starts), Shearer is a worthy leading actress here, notwithstanding the fact that her character is a morally upright woman who may be too perfect to exemplify as a true-to-life impersonation, Shearer's sincerity and grace alone can effortlessly win over audiences' heart and against the grain the magnificence of her id outshines the alter ego on screen and retains the limelight. Crawford is the anti-heroine, a manipulative home-wrecker owns every second during her presence, could be her stock-of-trade by hindsight, but how can one not relish the sparkling confrontations between her and Shearer when words are still able to kill. The last but not the least of the trinity is Russell, a snooty socialite falls into utter caricature, a loudmouth and busybody, oscillates between her chameleon-like affinities (either to Shearer or to Crawford), she might be the most dangerous creature among all the distaff. Then among secondary tier, a drop-dead gorgeous Fontaine is the romantic dreamer, a reverential Boland is the undying love-pursuer, an elegant and witty Goddard is the tactful helper, then a worldly and sensible Watson is the mother who gives appropriate advice when it is needed, and a lovable and juvenile Weidler pulls through an empathetic daughter-mother rapport between her and Shearer. A vivid dissection of vicissitudes on Park Avenue, the film may not be able to be connected to the huddled mass, and its thematic POV "pride is a luxury a woman in love cannot afford" might not be align with today's viewpoint, THE WOMEN still has its unique value in spearheading a paradigm shifting experiment (although ironically women are without exception subordinate to their men in the film) to break the shackles which 74 years later unfortunately is still hedging the film business ubiquitously, not to mention the astonishing fashion-show during the midstream (the only color part in this otherwise monochrome artifact), with a retrospective gaze, everything else is a puff, only haute couture relentlessly lasts!

    There have been plenty of films with an all-male, or almost all-male, cast, but films with an all-female cast are much rarer; in the thirties they were virtually unheard-of. There were, of course, plenty of what were called "women's pictures", aimed at a predominantly female audience and generally with a strong female character in the leading role, but as the theme of such films was normally heterosexual love and relationships there generally had to be men in the cast, if only as secondary characters. "The Women", however, is a "woman's picture" in which man are much discussed but never make an appearance; every single member of the cast is female. Today we tend to think of the Production Code era as being a time when the film industry was dominated by a crippling and oppressive Puritanism, but films like this one remind us that, in America at least, the censors were not as puritanical as we sometimes imagine. I cannot imagine this arch, knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties, but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. &nbsp; The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines, wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one, but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop-girl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know, and so it proves here, but the time-lag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one, largely because she has the sort of "friends" who (in the words of the song) can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldly-wise old mother, who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life, Mary travels to Reno, Nevada, to obtain a divorce. (In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which, despite being liberal in many other matters, has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law; it was the last state to legalise no-fault divorce, as recently as 2010).

    I thought this movie was pretty interesting and it showed women in certain point of view from the society that the movie was filmed in. I thought that there was a variety of characters both flat and round. I think the wide number of characters wasn't a problem, it actually made the movie better and stronger. They seemed to be comparing men and women, but yet there was not a single male in the movie. They did show women in a certain way, but they were just showing what women were like in the 1940's. The fashion show was the best scene in the movie if I could say so, it was shown in color. You knew that there was an audience for it because of the clapping,but you could not see them. You could sense tension, love and sadness in all the scenes, especially sadness when Mary told little Mary about the divorce. There was great emotion and love in this scene between the two of them, the camera seemed to focus on their faces and eyes, in that they were crying or very upset.

    This film was very comical, with quick and witty dialog. It was interesting to see a film from this time period that focused mainly on women as the main characters. I found it interesting how Sylvia went about trying to inform Mary about her husband's affair. Rather than telling her herself, she sets Mary up with an appointment with the same manicurist who told her about the affair. The character, Crystal came as a bit of a shock that she was completely unapologetic about the affair she was having with Mary's husband. I've noticed quite a few of the films I've viewed from this era displayed situations of infidelity quite frequently. It was a lot like the Stagecoach in that a group of characters were all different but yet tied in together when Mary met the women on the train to Reno. The ending was a bit of a surprise and brought justice to the women who were all in unfortunate situations due to one girl.

    Some of Hollywood's classic films age better than others. One would have expected THE WOMEN, with its depiction of upper-class wives as basically parasites who live off their husbands (and the alimony checks after the divorce), to have faded into oblivion years ago. That it has not is a tribute to director George Cukor, writers Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos (and some sources say an uncredited F Scott Fitzgerald, among others), and a stellar cast of the biggest female stars in MGM's galaxy. Somehow, getting past the basic premise, which should have dated badly but somehow has not, is fairly easy, mainly because this movie is just so much fun. From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing: Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily. Crawford only won one Oscar in her career, as the noble, self-sacrificing mother in MILDRED PIERCE, and her biographers have suggested that the Mildred role was how she saw herself, but I always liked her the best when she played a broad on the make, as in GRAND HOTEL and in this, possibly her best film role, and one which gave her one of the best exit lines ever written (see above). A lot has been said and written about the "sexist" nature of this film and the play upon which it was based, but Luce was writing of people she knew, and in those days a man who made or had serious money took care of his wife during their marriage and even after, so the film works, even today, I think, as a great comedy of manners that brilliantly spoofs upper class women with too much time on their hands and not enough scruples or ambition to actually DO anything themselves. I love this movie. Yes, it is sexist, and no, it could never work today (I know they remade it but I refuse to see it; the very idea is preposterous), but thanks to Cukor's skill in handling a cast that had not one man in the mix, THE WOMEN remains a classic comedy of manners with dialogue that will never go out of style.

    Now here's a movie that surprised me. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.

    The Women was a very interesting film, I wasn't very sold with it at first it was hard to focus on because so many things were going on, women were busy everywhere doing strange things, and they were talking a mile a minute. When things settled down I began to realize that it was doing a fantastic job of portraying the lives of well women. I think it's funny that you don't see a man in the ENTIRE film, not even the infamous "Stephen" Mary's husband. That actually made me laugh. All the women characters were quite good, none of them compare to Mary Haines of course. I loved Mary, she was fantastic, she was a sweetheart like everyone said throughout the movie, at first she seemed like someone to feel sorry for, but then you saw how strong she was and clever, that your sympathy turned to cheery as you waited to see Mary win in the end. I think the thing about her that impressed me the most, was how good of a mother she was at all times! Over all a good film.

    The groundbreaking gimmick of this vintage George Cukor film is its female-inclusive cast, a bitch-fest orbits around the admiration of their off-screen male counterparts, it is a cornucopia of malicious gossips, cloying feminine bonds, fierce squabbles with vicious innuendos, and culminates with a tit-for-tat machination to win back a man's heart. My tone sounds disparaging, but the film is a hoot to watch, gathering 3 divas, several starlets and many old stagers (all main characters have their respective animal analogs indicate their dispositions before the film starts), Shearer is a worthy leading actress here, notwithstanding the fact that her character is a morally upright woman who may be too perfect to exemplify as a true-to-life impersonation, Shearer's sincerity and grace alone can effortlessly win over audiences' heart and against the grain the magnificence of her id outshines the alter ego on screen and retains the limelight. Crawford is the anti-heroine, a manipulative home-wrecker owns every second during her presence, could be her stock-of-trade by hindsight, but how can one not relish the sparkling confrontations between her and Shearer when words are still able to kill. The last but not the least of the trinity is Russell, a snooty socialite falls into utter caricature, a loudmouth and busybody, oscillates between her chameleon-like affinities (either to Shearer or to Crawford), she might be the most dangerous creature among all the distaff. Then among secondary tier, a drop-dead gorgeous Fontaine is the romantic dreamer, a reverential Boland is the undying love-pursuer, an elegant and witty Goddard is the tactful helper, then a worldly and sensible Watson is the mother who gives appropriate advice when it is needed, and a lovable and juvenile Weidler pulls through an empathetic daughter-mother rapport between her and Shearer. A vivid dissection of vicissitudes on Park Avenue, the film may not be able to be connected to the huddled mass, and its thematic POV "pride is a luxury a woman in love cannot afford" might not be align with today's viewpoint, THE WOMEN still has its unique value in spearheading a paradigm shifting experiment (although ironically women are without exception subordinate to their men in the film) to break the shackles which 74 years later unfortunately is still hedging the film business ubiquitously, not to mention the astonishing fashion-show during the midstream (the only color part in this otherwise monochrome artifact), with a retrospective gaze, everything else is a puff, only haute couture relentlessly lasts!

    There have been plenty of films with an all-male, or almost all-male, cast, but films with an all-female cast are much rarer; in the thirties they were virtually unheard-of. There were, of course, plenty of what were called "women's pictures", aimed at a predominantly female audience and generally with a strong female character in the leading role, but as the theme of such films was normally heterosexual love and relationships there generally had to be men in the cast, if only as secondary characters. "The Women", however, is a "woman's picture" in which man are much discussed but never make an appearance; every single member of the cast is female. Today we tend to think of the Production Code era as being a time when the film industry was dominated by a crippling and oppressive Puritanism, but films like this one remind us that, in America at least, the censors were not as puritanical as we sometimes imagine. I cannot imagine this arch, knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties, but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. &nbsp; The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines, wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one, but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop-girl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know, and so it proves here, but the time-lag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one, largely because she has the sort of "friends" who (in the words of the song) can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldly-wise old mother, who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life, Mary travels to Reno, Nevada, to obtain a divorce. (In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which, despite being liberal in many other matters, has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law; it was the last state to legalise no-fault divorce, as recently as 2010). Stephen marries Crystal, but the marriage is not a happy one and Mary sees her chance to turn the tables on her rival. The role of Mary- the noble, idealistic, long-suffering wronged wife, not unattractive but a bit sexless- seemed ready-made for Norma Shearer, who seemed to specialise in&nbsp;such parts. Joan Crawford tries to make the most of the mercenary, conniving Crystal, but she was really a bit too old for the part. Crawford tended to guard her age as though it were an official secret, but she seems to have been born around 1904, making her about 35 in 1939, only two years or so younger than Shearer. The age-gap between Mary and&nbsp;Crystal needs to be much greater; a dedicated gold- digger like Crystal would doubtless have got her man long before she reached her mid-thirties. When the film was remade in 1956 as "The Opposite Sex" Crystal was played by another "Joan C", Collins, sixteen years younger than June Allyson who played the Mary-figure. "The Women"&nbsp;is often regarded as a great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age, but it is not a film I care for very much. It has some good points; there is occasionally some witty dialogue, Shearer is reasonably good as Mary and the child star Virginia Weidler is enchanting as her young daughter Little Mary. It also, however, has a number of faults. The first is that the decision not to have any male characters was a mistaken gimmick; the makers of "The Opposite Sex" clearly realised this because they altered the plot in order to show Stephen and some of the other men referred to. The mainspring of the plot is, after all, the marriage of Mary and Stephen, and to show only one side of their relationship is to tell only half the story. The second flaw is that the action does not always flow easily. The film is in&nbsp;black-and-white but includes a ten-minute fashion parade filmed in&nbsp;Technicolor, which does not advance the plot at all but slows the action right down. Apparently director George Cukor disliked the sequence and wanted to remove it but was overruled by&nbsp;the studio who evidently felt that female audiences would want to see what the well- dressed woman was wearing that year. Today it has little interest except for the few who care about what the well-dressed woman was wearing more than seventy years ago. At other times, however, it seems that Cukor, perhaps realising that the script contained too much dialogue to be accommodated within the film's running time, had instructed his cast to speak their lines as quickly as possible. The worst, although by no means the only, offender in this regard is the motormouth Rosalind Russell as Mary's bitchy cousin Sylvia. (Russell was to be better in another comedy, "His Girl Friday", the following year). The film's third, and worst, fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a "woman's picture" it is surprisingly misogynistic, embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in "The Women"&nbsp;inhabit the sort of world where nearly all women (Mary being one of the few exceptions) are spiteful, scheming, bitchy, gossipy and&nbsp;backstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman, often her so-called "best friend", who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a "war of the sexes" the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 5/10

    Famed "women's director" George Cukor sure gets his fill in The Woman, a smartly written screwball by Claire Luce and adapted for the screen by Anita Loos that is totally void of men in any role. With a powerhouse cast firing on all cylinders Cukor and the girls do such a fine job you never even miss them, though along with money and high fashion they remain one of the major topics of conversation throughout. Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) is living an enviable existence of a well to do married woman without a care in thee world. A wonderful daughter, perfect husband days filled with shopping and leisure activities until one pampered afternoon a manicurist lets it slip hubby is seeing a perfume counter girl / gold digger Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). While it shakes Mary to her core, the lurid gossip inspires "friend" Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell)to amp things up and rather than attempt reconciliation Mary divorces. At a ranch in Reno the women now joined by Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard to wait out divorces to marry others, in Goddard's case, Fowler's husband and the claws come out. By then Allen has hers completely in Mr. Haines with a wedding ring around one of them. Marriage however has not curtailed Crystals fortune hunter ways. One can only wonder how Cukor handled his temperamental movie queens to show he wasn't favoring the other. Luce's script crackles with sardonic wit and catty commentary that the ladies (especially Crawford and Russell)deliver with almost hisses while noble Shearer soldiers on through degrading gossip. Shearer at the center of the story is fine as the linchpin character in the film allowing the showier characters played with aplomb by Russell and Crawford to feast on her virtue and hurt, heightening their petty villainy. Midway through the already crowded field of fine female performances the film picks up three more from Marie Boland, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main all willing to dispense their take on life and men with acerbic resignation. There's a jarring Technicolor fashion show in this B&W that makes no sense at all and while it arguable that The Women sells out with a Hollywood ending there is no denying that this unique experiment with over a hundred female speaking roles and the complete absence of men is a resounding success. It's a chick flic but men could learn plenty from it.

    Another great film from the 1940's. Rosalind Russell is one of my favorites and is hilarious as the meddling Sylvia. The pace of the movie was rather mixed: seemed overly speedy at first and drawn out toward the end, such as in the fashion show, but each pace served the tone of the scene and held the audience in the right frame of mind. Not only was the movie entertaining, but it had themes relevant to the era that are just as important today. The generational gap is obvious between Mrs. Haines and her mother, and they have opposite views on how to handle infidelity, a frequent subject tackled on the screen. Some of the things about marriage said by the mother remind me of how my grandmother has talked about divorcecertain things simply weren't done, yet are commonplace today, and this movie focuses on a turning point. Touching and funny all in one

    It's a fascinating look into the world of women in all their beauty and loveliness, malevolence and ugliness, wretchedness and wickedness, jealousy and joy, goodness and grace and smarts and sexiness. The acting is great, the dialogue is sharp and the story flows and moves along quite nicely. There's a lot going on, it's a dense and complex film with many facets. It's a canvas in which comments and criticisms on social status, beauty, divorce, jealousy, adultery, fashion and more are shaped. The film accomplishes this in such a way that it sparks a lot of thought and debate, the films story lasts long after the film is over which is why I enjoyed it. It wasn't just a comedy it was socially meaningful and I think it resonates in many ways today. The things portrayed in this film are not ancient nor are they outdated, these values and behaviors are still found in our society and I think this film is a valuable portrait of that.

My tone sounds disparaging, but the film is a hoot to watch, gathering 3 divas, several starlets and many old stagers (all main characters have their respective animal analogs indicate their dispositions before the film starts), Shearer is a worthy leading actress here, notwithstanding the fact that her character is a morally upright woman who may be too perfect to exemplify as a true-to-life impersonation, Shearer's sincerity and grace alone can effortlessly win over audiences' heart and against the grain the magnificence of her id outshines the alter ego on screen and retains the limelight. Crawford is the anti-heroine, a manipulative home-wrecker owns every second during her presence, could be her stock-of-trade by hindsight, but how can one not relish the sparkling confrontations between her and Shearer when words are still able to kill. The last but not the least of the trinity is Russell, a snooty socialite falls into utter caricature, a loudmouth and busybody, oscillates between her chameleon-like affinities (either to Shearer or to Crawford), she might be the most dangerous creature among all the distaff. Then among secondary tier, a drop-dead gorgeous Fontaine is the romantic dreamer, a reverential Boland is the undying love-pursuer, an elegant and witty Goddard is the tactful helper, then a worldly and sensible Watson is the mother who gives appropriate advice when it is needed, and a lovable and juvenile Weidler pulls through an empathetic daughter-mother rapport between her and Shearer. A vivid dissection of vicissitudes on Park Avenue, the film may not be able to be connected to the huddled mass, and its thematic POV "pride is a luxury a woman in love cannot afford" might not be align with today's viewpoint, THE WOMEN still has its unique value in spearheading a paradigm shifting experiment (although ironically women are without exception subordinate to their men in the film) to break the shackles which 74 years later unfortunately is still hedging the film business ubiquitously, not to mention the astonishing fashion-show during the midstream (the only color part in this otherwise monochrome artifact), with a retrospective gaze, everything else is a puff, only haute couture relentlessly lasts!

    There have been plenty of films with an all-male, or almost all-male, cast, but films with an all-female cast are much rarer; in the thirties they were virtually unheard-of. There were, of course, plenty of what were called "women's pictures", aimed at a predominantly female audience and generally with a strong female character in the leading role, but as the theme of such films was normally heterosexual love and relationships there generally had to be men in the cast, if only as secondary characters. "The Women", however, is a "woman's picture" in which man are much discussed but never make an appearance; every single member of the cast is female. Today we tend to think of the Production Code era as being a time when the film industry was dominated by a crippling and oppressive Puritanism, but films like this one remind us that, in America at least, the censors were not as puritanical as we sometimes imagine. I cannot imagine this arch, knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties, but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. &nbsp; The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines, wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one, but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop-girl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know, and so it proves here, but the time-lag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one, largely because she has the sort of "friends" who (in the words of the song) can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldly-wise old mother, who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life, Mary travels to Reno, Nevada, to obtain a divorce. (In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which, despite being liberal in many other matters, has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law; it was the last state to legalise no-fault divorce, as recently as 2010). Stephen marries Crystal, but the marriage is not a happy one and Mary sees her chance to turn the tables on her rival. The role of Mary- the noble, idealistic, long-suffering wronged wife, not unattractive but a bit sexless- seemed ready-made for Norma Shearer, who seemed to specialise in&nbsp;such parts. Joan Crawford tries to make the most of the mercenary, conniving Crystal, but she was really a bit too old for the part. Crawford tended to guard her age as though it were an official secret, but she seems to have been born around 1904, making her about 35 in 1939, only two years or so younger than Shearer. The age-gap between Mary and&nbsp;Crystal needs to be much greater; a dedicated gold- digger like Crystal would doubtless have got her man long before she reached her mid-thirties. When the film was remade in 1956 as "The Opposite Sex" Crystal was played by another "Joan C", Collins, sixteen years younger than June Allyson who played the Mary-figure. "The Women"&nbsp;is often regarded as a great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age, but it is not a film I care for very much. It has some good points; there is occasionally some witty dialogue, Shearer is reasonably good as Mary and the child star Virginia Weidler is enchanting as her young daughter Little Mary. It also, however, has a number of faults. The first is that the decision not to have any male characters was a mistaken gimmick; the makers of "The Opposite Sex" clearly realised this because they altered the plot in order to show Stephen and some of the other men referred to. The mainspring of the plot is, after all, the marriage of Mary and Stephen, and to show only one side of their relationship is to tell only half the story. The second flaw is that the action does not always flow easily. The film is in&nbsp;black-and-white but includes a ten-minute fashion parade filmed in&nbsp;Technicolor, which does not advance the plot at all but slows the action right down. Apparently director George Cukor disliked the sequence and wanted to remove it but was overruled by&nbsp;the studio who evidently felt that female audiences would want to see what the well- dressed woman was wearing that year. Today it has little interest except for the few who care about what the well-dressed woman was wearing more than seventy years ago. At other times, however, it seems that Cukor, perhaps realising that the script contained too much dialogue to be accommodated within the film's running time, had instructed his cast to speak their lines as quickly as possible. The worst, although by no means the only, offender in this regard is the motormouth Rosalind Russell as Mary's bitchy cousin Sylvia. (Russell was to be better in another comedy, "His Girl Friday", the following year). The film's third, and worst, fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a "woman's picture" it is surprisingly misogynistic, embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in "The Women"&nbsp;inhabit the sort of world where nearly all women (Mary being one of the few exceptions) are spiteful, scheming, bitchy, gossipy and&nbsp;backstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman, often her so-called "best friend", who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a "war of the sexes" the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 5/10

    Famed "women's director" George Cukor sure gets his fill in The Woman, a smartly written screwball by Claire Luce and adapted for the screen by Anita Loos that is totally void of men in any role. With a powerhouse cast firing on all cylinders Cukor and the girls do such a fine job you never even miss them, though along with money and high fashion they remain one of the major topics of conversation throughout. Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) is living an enviable existence of a well to do married woman without a care in thee world. A wonderful daughter, perfect husband days filled with shopping and leisure activities until one pampered afternoon a manicurist lets it slip hubby is seeing a perfume counter girl / gold digger Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). While it shakes Mary to her core, the lurid gossip inspires "friend" Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell)to amp things up and rather than attempt reconciliation Mary divorces. At a ranch in Reno the women now joined by Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard to wait out divorces to marry others, in Goddard's case, Fowler's husband and the claws come out. By then Allen has hers completely in Mr. Haines with a wedding ring around one of them. Marriage however has not curtailed Crystals fortune hunter ways. One can only wonder how Cukor handled his temperamental movie queens to show he wasn't favoring the other. Luce's script crackles with sardonic wit and catty commentary that the ladies (especially Crawford and Russell)deliver with almost hisses while noble Shearer soldiers on through degrading gossip. Shearer at the center of the story is fine as the linchpin character in the film allowing the showier characters played with aplomb by Russell and Crawford to feast on her virtue and hurt, heightening their petty villainy. Midway through the already crowded field of fine female performances the film picks up three more from Marie Boland, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main all willing to dispense their take on life and men with acerbic resignation. There's a jarring Technicolor fashion show in this B&W that makes no sense at all and while it arguable that The Women sells out with a Hollywood ending there is no denying that this unique experiment with over a hundred female speaking roles and the complete absence of men is a resounding success. It's a chick flic but men could learn plenty from it.

    Another great film from the 1940's. Rosalind Russell is one of my favorites and is hilarious as the meddling Sylvia. The pace of the movie was rather mixed: seemed overly speedy at first and drawn out toward the end, such as in the fashion show, but each pace served the tone of the scene and held the audience in the right frame of mind. Not only was the movie entertaining, but it had themes relevant to the era that are just as important today. The generational gap is obvious between Mrs. Haines and her mother, and they have opposite views on how to handle infidelity, a frequent subject tackled on the screen. Some of the things about marriage said by the mother remind me of how my grandmother has talked about divorcecertain things simply weren't done, yet are commonplace today, and this movie focuses on a turning point. Touching and funny all in one

    It's a fascinating look into the world of women in all their beauty and loveliness, malevolence and ugliness, wretchedness and wickedness, jealousy and joy, goodness and grace and smarts and sexiness. The acting is great, the dialogue is sharp and the story flows and moves along quite nicely. There's a lot going on, it's a dense and complex film with many facets. It's a canvas in which comments and criticisms on social status, beauty, divorce, jealousy, adultery, fashion and more are shaped. The film accomplishes this in such a way that it sparks a lot of thought and debate, the films story lasts long after the film is over which is why I enjoyed it. It wasn't just a comedy it was socially meaningful and I think it resonates in many ways today. The things portrayed in this film are not ancient nor are they outdated, these values and behaviors are still found in our society and I think this film is a valuable portrait of that.

    I thought this movie was pretty interesting and it showed women in certain point of view from the society that the movie was filmed in. I thought that there was a variety of characters both flat and round. I think the wide number of characters wasn't a problem, it actually made the movie better and stronger. They seemed to be comparing men and women, but yet there was not a single male in the movie. They did show women in a certain way, but they were just showing what women were like in the 1940's. The fashion show was the best scene in the movie if I could say so, it was shown in color. You knew that there was an audience for it because of the clapping,but you could not see them. You could sense tension, love and sadness in all the scenes, especially sadness when Mary told little Mary about the divorce. There was great emotion and love in this scene between the two of them, the camera seemed to focus on their faces and eyes, in that they were crying or very upset.

    This film was very comical, with quick and witty dialog. It was interesting to see a film from this time period that focused mainly on women as the main characters. I found it interesting how Sylvia went about trying to inform Mary about her husband's affair. Rather than telling her herself, she sets Mary up with an appointment with the same manicurist who told her about the affair. The character, Crystal came as a bit of a shock that she was completely unapologetic about the affair she was having with Mary's husband. I've noticed quite a few of the films I've viewed from this era displayed situations of infidelity quite frequently. It was a lot like the Stagecoach in that a group of characters were all different but yet tied in together when Mary met the women on the train to Reno. The ending was a bit of a surprise and brought justice to the women who were all in unfortunate situations due to one girl.

    Some of Hollywood's classic films age better than others. One would have expected THE WOMEN, with its depiction of upper-class wives as basically parasites who live off their husbands (and the alimony checks after the divorce), to have faded into oblivion years ago. That it has not is a tribute to director George Cukor, writers Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos (and some sources say an uncredited F Scott Fitzgerald, among others), and a stellar cast of the biggest female stars in MGM's galaxy. Somehow, getting past the basic premise, which should have dated badly but somehow has not, is fairly easy, mainly because this movie is just so much fun. From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing: Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily. Crawford only won one Oscar in her career, as the noble, self-sacrificing mother in MILDRED PIERCE, and her biographers have suggested that the Mildred role was how she saw herself, but I always liked her the best when she played a broad on the make, as in GRAND HOTEL and in this, possibly her best film role, and one which gave her one of the best exit lines ever written (see above). A lot has been said and written about the "sexist" nature of this film and the play upon which it was based, but Luce was writing of people she knew, and in those days a man who made or had serious money took care of his wife during their marriage and even after, so the film works, even today, I think, as a great comedy of manners that brilliantly spoofs upper class women with too much time on their hands and not enough scruples or ambition to actually DO anything themselves. I love this movie. Yes, it is sexist, and no, it could never work today (I know they remade it but I refuse to see it; the very idea is preposterous), but thanks to Cukor's skill in handling a cast that had not one man in the mix, THE WOMEN remains a classic comedy of manners with dialogue that will never go out of style.

    Now here's a movie that surprised me. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.

    The Women was a very interesting film, I wasn't very sold with it at first it was hard to focus on because so many things were going on, women were busy everywhere doing strange things, and they were talking a mile a minute. When things settled down I began to realize that it was doing a fantastic job of portraying the lives of well women. I think it's funny that you don't see a man in the ENTIRE film, not even the infamous "Stephen" Mary's husband. That actually made me laugh. All the women characters were quite good, none of them compare to Mary Haines of course. I loved Mary, she was fantastic, she was a sweetheart like everyone said throughout the movie, at first she seemed like someone to feel sorry for, but then you saw how strong she was and clever, that your sympathy turned to cheery as you waited to see Mary win in the end. I think the thing about her that impressed me the most, was how good of a mother she was at all times! Over all a good film.

Midway through the already crowded field of fine female performances the film picks up three more from Marie Boland, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main all willing to dispense their take on life and men with acerbic resignation. There's a jarring Technicolor fashion show in this B&W that makes no sense at all and while it arguable that The Women sells out with a Hollywood ending there is no denying that this unique experiment with over a hundred female speaking roles and the complete absence of men is a resounding success. It's a chick flic but men could learn plenty from it.

    Another great film from the 1940's. Rosalind Russell is one of my favorites and is hilarious as the meddling Sylvia. The pace of the movie was rather mixed: seemed overly speedy at first and drawn out toward the end, such as in the fashion show, but each pace served the tone of the scene and held the audience in the right frame of mind. Not only was the movie entertaining, but it had themes relevant to the era that are just as important today. The generational gap is obvious between Mrs. Haines and her mother, and they have opposite views on how to handle infidelity, a frequent subject tackled on the screen. Some of the things about marriage said by the mother remind me of how my grandmother has talked about divorcecertain things simply weren't done, yet are commonplace today, and this movie focuses on a turning point. Touching and funny all in one

    It's a fascinating look into the world of women in all their beauty and loveliness, malevolence and ugliness, wretchedness and wickedness, jealousy and joy, goodness and grace and smarts and sexiness. The acting is great, the dialogue is sharp and the story flows and moves along quite nicely. There's a lot going on, it's a dense and complex film with many facets. It's a canvas in which comments and criticisms on social status, beauty, divorce, jealousy, adultery, fashion and more are shaped. The film accomplishes this in such a way that it sparks a lot of thought and debate, the films story lasts long after the film is over which is why I enjoyed it. It wasn't just a comedy it was socially meaningful and I think it resonates in many ways today. The things portrayed in this film are not ancient nor are they outdated, these values and behaviors are still found in our society and I think this film is a valuable portrait of that.

    I thought this movie was pretty interesting and it showed women in certain point of view from the society that the movie was filmed in. I thought that there was a variety of characters both flat and round. I think the wide number of characters wasn't a problem, it actually made the movie better and stronger. They seemed to be comparing men and women, but yet there was not a single male in the movie. They did show women in a certain way, but they were just showing what women were like in the 1940's. The fashion show was the best scene in the movie if I could say so, it was shown in color. You knew that there was an audience for it because of the clapping,but you could not see them. You could sense tension, love and sadness in all the scenes, especially sadness when Mary told little Mary about the divorce. There was great emotion and love in this scene between the two of them, the camera seemed to focus on their faces and eyes, in that they were crying or very upset.

    This film was very comical, with quick and witty dialog. It was interesting to see a film from this time period that focused mainly on women as the main characters. I found it interesting how Sylvia went about trying to inform Mary about her husband's affair. Rather than telling her herself, she sets Mary up with an appointment with the same manicurist who told her about the affair. The character, Crystal came as a bit of a shock that she was completely unapologetic about the affair she was having with Mary's husband. I've noticed quite a few of the films I've viewed from this era displayed situations of infidelity quite frequently. It was a lot like the Stagecoach in that a group of characters were all different but yet tied in together when Mary met the women on the train to Reno. The ending was a bit of a surprise and brought justice to the women who were all in unfortunate situations due to one girl.

    Some of Hollywood's classic films age better than others. One would have expected THE WOMEN, with its depiction of upper-class wives as basically parasites who live off their husbands (and the alimony checks after the divorce), to have faded into oblivion years ago. That it has not is a tribute to director George Cukor, writers Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos (and some sources say an uncredited F Scott Fitzgerald, among others), and a stellar cast of the biggest female stars in MGM's galaxy. Somehow, getting past the basic premise, which should have dated badly but somehow has not, is fairly easy, mainly because this movie is just so much fun. From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing: Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily. Crawford only won one Oscar in her career, as the noble, self-sacrificing mother in MILDRED PIERCE, and her biographers have suggested that the Mildred role was how she saw herself, but I always liked her the best when she played a broad on the make, as in GRAND HOTEL and in this, possibly her best film role, and one which gave her one of the best exit lines ever written (see above). A lot has been said and written about the "sexist" nature of this film and the play upon which it was based, but Luce was writing of people she knew, and in those days a man who made or had serious money took care of his wife during their marriage and even after, so the film works, even today, I think, as a great comedy of manners that brilliantly spoofs upper class women with too much time on their hands and not enough scruples or ambition to actually DO anything themselves. I love this movie. Yes, it is sexist, and no, it could never work today (I know they remade it but I refuse to see it; the very idea is preposterous), but thanks to Cukor's skill in handling a cast that had not one man in the mix, THE WOMEN remains a classic comedy of manners with dialogue that will never go out of style.

    Now here's a movie that surprised me. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.

    The Women was a very interesting film, I wasn't very sold with it at first it was hard to focus on because so many things were going on, women were busy everywhere doing strange things, and they were talking a mile a minute. When things settled down I began to realize that it was doing a fantastic job of portraying the lives of well women. I think it's funny that you don't see a man in the ENTIRE film, not even the infamous "Stephen" Mary's husband. That actually made me laugh. All the women characters were quite good, none of them compare to Mary Haines of course. I loved Mary, she was fantastic, she was a sweetheart like everyone said throughout the movie, at first she seemed like someone to feel sorry for, but then you saw how strong she was and clever, that your sympathy turned to cheery as you waited to see Mary win in the end. I think the thing about her that impressed me the most, was how good of a mother she was at all times! Over all a good film.

    The groundbreaking gimmick of this vintage George Cukor film is its female-inclusive cast, a bitch-fest orbits around the admiration of their off-screen male counterparts, it is a cornucopia of malicious gossips, cloying feminine bonds, fierce squabbles with vicious innuendos, and culminates with a tit-for-tat machination to win back a man's heart. My tone sounds disparaging, but the film is a hoot to watch, gathering 3 divas, several starlets and many old stagers (all main characters have their respective animal analogs indicate their dispositions before the film starts), Shearer is a worthy leading actress here, notwithstanding the fact that her character is a morally upright woman who may be too perfect to exemplify as a true-to-life impersonation, Shearer's sincerity and grace alone can effortlessly win over audiences' heart and against the grain the magnificence of her id outshines the alter ego on screen and retains the limelight. Crawford is the anti-heroine, a manipulative home-wrecker owns every second during her presence, could be her stock-of-trade by hindsight, but how can one not relish the sparkling confrontations between her and Shearer when words are still able to kill. The last but not the least of the trinity is Russell, a snooty socialite falls into utter caricature, a loudmouth and busybody, oscillates between her chameleon-like affinities (either to Shearer or to Crawford), she might be the most dangerous creature among all the distaff. Then among secondary tier, a drop-dead gorgeous Fontaine is the romantic dreamer, a reverential Boland is the undying love-pursuer, an elegant and witty Goddard is the tactful helper, then a worldly and sensible Watson is the mother who gives appropriate advice when it is needed, and a lovable and juvenile Weidler pulls through an empathetic daughter-mother rapport between her and Shearer. A vivid dissection of vicissitudes on Park Avenue, the film may not be able to be connected to the huddled mass, and its thematic POV "pride is a luxury a woman in love cannot afford" might not be align with today's viewpoint, THE WOMEN still has its unique value in spearheading a paradigm shifting experiment (although ironically women are without exception subordinate to their men in the film) to break the shackles which 74 years later unfortunately is still hedging the film business ubiquitously, not to mention the astonishing fashion-show during the midstream (the only color part in this otherwise monochrome artifact), with a retrospective gaze, everything else is a puff, only haute couture relentlessly lasts!

    There have been plenty of films with an all-male, or almost all-male, cast, but films with an all-female cast are much rarer; in the thirties they were virtually unheard-of. There were, of course, plenty of what were called "women's pictures", aimed at a predominantly female audience and generally with a strong female character in the leading role, but as the theme of such films was normally heterosexual love and relationships there generally had to be men in the cast, if only as secondary characters. "The Women", however, is a "woman's picture" in which man are much discussed but never make an appearance; every single member of the cast is female. Today we tend to think of the Production Code era as being a time when the film industry was dominated by a crippling and oppressive Puritanism, but films like this one remind us that, in America at least, the censors were not as puritanical as we sometimes imagine. I cannot imagine this arch, knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties, but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. &nbsp; The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines, wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one, but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop-girl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know, and so it proves here, but the time-lag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one, largely because she has the sort of "friends" who (in the words of the song) can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldly-wise old mother, who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life, Mary travels to Reno, Nevada, to obtain a divorce. (In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which, despite being liberal in many other matters, has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law; it was the last state to legalise no-fault divorce, as recently as 2010). Stephen marries Crystal, but the marriage is not a happy one and Mary sees her chance to turn the tables on her rival. The role of Mary- the noble, idealistic, long-suffering wronged wife, not unattractive but a bit sexless- seemed ready-made for Norma Shearer, who seemed to specialise in&nbsp;such parts. Joan Crawford tries to make the most of the mercenary, conniving Crystal, but she was really a bit too old for the part. Crawford tended to guard her age as though it were an official secret, but she seems to have been born around 1904, making her about 35 in 1939, only two years or so younger than Shearer. The age-gap between Mary and&nbsp;Crystal needs to be much greater; a dedicated gold- digger like Crystal would doubtless have got her man long before she reached her mid-thirties. When the film was remade in 1956 as "The Opposite Sex" Crystal was played by another "Joan C", Collins, sixteen years younger than June Allyson who played the Mary-figure. "The Women"&nbsp;is often regarded as a great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age, but it is not a film I care for very much. It has some good points; there is occasionally some witty dialogue, Shearer is reasonably good as Mary and the child star Virginia Weidler is enchanting as her young daughter Little Mary. It also, however, has a number of faults. The first is that the decision not to have any male characters was a mistaken gimmick; the makers of "The Opposite Sex" clearly realised this because they altered the plot in order to show Stephen and some of the other men referred to. The mainspring of the plot is, after all, the marriage of Mary and Stephen, and to show only one side of their relationship is to tell only half the story. The second flaw is that the action does not always flow easily. The film is in&nbsp;black-and-white but includes a ten-minute fashion parade filmed in&nbsp;Technicolor, which does not advance the plot at all but slows the action right down. Apparently director George Cukor disliked the sequence and wanted to remove it but was overruled by&nbsp;the studio who evidently felt that female audiences would want to see what the well- dressed woman was wearing that year. Today it has little interest except for the few who care about what the well-dressed woman was wearing more than seventy years ago. At other times, however, it seems that Cukor, perhaps realising that the script contained too much dialogue to be accommodated within the film's running time, had instructed his cast to speak their lines as quickly as possible. The worst, although by no means the only, offender in this regard is the motormouth Rosalind Russell as Mary's bitchy cousin Sylvia. (Russell was to be better in another comedy, "His Girl Friday", the following year). The film's third, and worst, fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a "woman's picture" it is surprisingly misogynistic, embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in "The Women"&nbsp;inhabit the sort of world where nearly all women (Mary being one of the few exceptions) are spiteful, scheming, bitchy, gossipy and&nbsp;backstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman, often her so-called "best friend", who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a "war of the sexes" the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 5/10

    Famed "women's director" George Cukor sure gets his fill in The Woman, a smartly written screwball by Claire Luce and adapted for the screen by Anita Loos that is totally void of men in any role. With a powerhouse cast firing on all cylinders Cukor and the girls do such a fine job you never even miss them, though along with money and high fashion they remain one of the major topics of conversation throughout. Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) is living an enviable existence of a well to do married woman without a care in thee world. A wonderful daughter, perfect husband days filled with shopping and leisure activities until one pampered afternoon a manicurist lets it slip hubby is seeing a perfume counter girl / gold digger Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). While it shakes Mary to her core, the lurid gossip inspires "friend" Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell)to amp things up and rather than attempt reconciliation Mary divorces. At a ranch in Reno the women now joined by Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard to wait out divorces to marry others, in Goddard's case, Fowler's husband and the claws come out. By then Allen has hers completely in Mr. Haines with a wedding ring around one of them. Marriage however has not curtailed Crystals fortune hunter ways. One can only wonder how Cukor handled his temperamental movie queens to show he wasn't favoring the other. Luce's script crackles with sardonic wit and catty commentary that the ladies (especially Crawford and Russell)deliver with almost hisses while noble Shearer soldiers on through degrading gossip. Shearer at the center of the story is fine as the linchpin character in the film allowing the showier characters played with aplomb by Russell and Crawford to feast on her virtue and hurt, heightening their petty villainy. Midway through the already crowded field of fine female performances the film picks up three more from Marie Boland, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main all willing to dispense their take on life and men with acerbic resignation. There's a jarring Technicolor fashion show in this B&W that makes no sense at all and while it arguable that The Women sells out with a Hollywood ending there is no denying that this unique experiment with over a hundred female speaking roles and the complete absence of men is a resounding success. It's a chick flic but men could learn plenty from it.

Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.

    The Women was a very interesting film, I wasn't very sold with it at first it was hard to focus on because so many things were going on, women were busy everywhere doing strange things, and they were talking a mile a minute. When things settled down I began to realize that it was doing a fantastic job of portraying the lives of well women. I think it's funny that you don't see a man in the ENTIRE film, not even the infamous "Stephen" Mary's husband. That actually made me laugh. All the women characters were quite good, none of them compare to Mary Haines of course. I loved Mary, she was fantastic, she was a sweetheart like everyone said throughout the movie, at first she seemed like someone to feel sorry for, but then you saw how strong she was and clever, that your sympathy turned to cheery as you waited to see Mary win in the end. I think the thing about her that impressed me the most, was how good of a mother she was at all times! Over all a good film.
