    As a child i adored this movie, in particular the TV series as well, my favourite character in the TV series was between zac (the black ranger), and of course tommy (the white ranger), also known as the green ranger to some people. I had first heard about this movie in the year 1999, when i did i was only 7 years old, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie at first and have so ever since,the storyline is perfect along with the perfectly choreographed fight scenes. Overall i felt that this movie was unfairly rated and have so ever since, i even decided to watch this movie as a teenager and still felt that this movie deserved a much better rating than its current one. Movies such as "Les Miserables", "Star Trek" (2009), "Harry Potter", "Life of Pi", "The King's Speech", the list is endless, and also a surprise to see such high ratings for movies that deserve far much less of an overall rating. The thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this movie was made in the year 1995, the technology we have now was not made available to movie studios back then, and even so if they were it required the producer to pay a large sum of money, the point is this, when taking into consideration the year and the tools available, you have to understand that this was a really good, nostalgic movie and deserved a much higher rating. I like the movie, millions of other people also like the movie, the point of this review, is to let people know that you should not always follow the rating but instead try to read people's submitted articles as they, the people writing them are the ones telling the actual truth. My Rating: 8.0/10

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I wish i could give you a hard slap in the face. this was our childhoods. this was out life. this was us. power rangers, and especially these six were some of the most influential people in my life. yeah that sounds silly now. but we were 5 YEARS OLD or so. every damn critique on IMDb is coming from people who said they loved it, but now that they watched it as adults, saw how corny and childish it was. NO FU&Ccedil;KING SHI. I honestly can't believe the stupidity from some people. its meant for kids. and this was glorious. everything about this movie and the other originals deserve so much more regard. it saddens me that this movie is tarnished for such a bad rating. i just watched it again and it filled me up with so many good memories i can't even explain it. stupid people.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

    ....is with a group of people saying witty things after each character says them on the screen, mockingly...and that's what I and some people did when we saw this movie one night in Toronto! We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway. As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I wish i could give you a hard slap in the face. this was our childhoods. this was out life. this was us. power rangers, and especially these six were some of the most influential people in my life. yeah that sounds silly now. but we were 5 YEARS OLD or so. every damn critique on IMDb is coming from people who said they loved it, but now that they watched it as adults, saw how corny and childish it was. NO FU&Ccedil;KING SHI. I honestly can't believe the stupidity from some people. its meant for kids. and this was glorious. everything about this movie and the other originals deserve so much more regard. it saddens me that this movie is tarnished for such a bad rating. i just watched it again and it filled me up with so many good memories i can't even explain it. stupid people.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

    ....is with a group of people saying witty things after each character says them on the screen, mockingly...and that's what I and some people did when we saw this movie one night in Toronto! We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway. As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

    As a child i adored this movie, in particular the TV series as well, my favourite character in the TV series was between zac (the black ranger), and of course tommy (the white ranger), also known as the green ranger to some people. I had first heard about this movie in the year 1999, when i did i was only 7 years old, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie at first and have so ever since,the storyline is perfect along with the perfectly choreographed fight scenes. Overall i felt that this movie was unfairly rated and have so ever since, i even decided to watch this movie as a teenager and still felt that this movie deserved a much better rating than its current one. Movies such as "Les Miserables", "Star Trek" (2009), "Harry Potter", "Life of Pi", "The King's Speech", the list is endless, and also a surprise to see such high ratings for movies that deserve far much less of an overall rating. The thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this movie was made in the year 1995, the technology we have now was not made available to movie studios back then, and even so if they were it required the producer to pay a large sum of money, the point is this, when taking into consideration the year and the tools available, you have to understand that this was a really good, nostalgic movie and deserved a much higher rating. I like the movie, millions of other people also like the movie, the point of this review, is to let people know that you should not always follow the rating but instead try to read people's submitted articles as they, the people writing them are the ones telling the actual truth. My Rating: 8.0/10

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I wish i could give you a hard slap in the face. this was our childhoods. this was out life. this was us. power rangers, and especially these six were some of the most influential people in my life. yeah that sounds silly now. but we were 5 YEARS OLD or so. every damn critique on IMDb is coming from people who said they loved it, but now that they watched it as adults, saw how corny and childish it was. NO FU&Ccedil;KING SHI. I honestly can't believe the stupidity from some people. its meant for kids. and this was glorious. everything about this movie and the other originals deserve so much more regard. it saddens me that this movie is tarnished for such a bad rating. i just watched it again and it filled me up with so many good memories i can't even explain it. stupid people.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

    ....is with a group of people saying witty things after each character says them on the screen, mockingly...and that's what I and some people did when we saw this movie one night in Toronto! We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway. As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

    As a child i adored this movie, in particular the TV series as well, my favourite character in the TV series was between zac (the black ranger), and of course tommy (the white ranger), also known as the green ranger to some people. I had first heard about this movie in the year 1999, when i did i was only 7 years old, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie at first and have so ever since,the storyline is perfect along with the perfectly choreographed fight scenes. Overall i felt that this movie was unfairly rated and have so ever since, i even decided to watch this movie as a teenager and still felt that this movie deserved a much better rating than its current one. Movies such as "Les Miserables", "Star Trek" (2009), "Harry Potter", "Life of Pi", "The King's Speech", the list is endless, and also a surprise to see such high ratings for movies that deserve far much less of an overall rating. The thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this movie was made in the year 1995, the technology we have now was not made available to movie studios back then, and even so if they were it required the producer to pay a large sum of money, the point is this, when taking into consideration the year and the tools available, you have to understand that this was a really good, nostalgic movie and deserved a much higher rating. I like the movie, millions of other people also like the movie, the point of this review, is to let people know that you should not always follow the rating but instead try to read people's submitted articles as they, the people writing them are the ones telling the actual truth. My Rating: 8.0/10

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

    ....is with a group of people saying witty things after each character says them on the screen, mockingly...and that's what I and some people did when we saw this movie one night in Toronto! We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway. As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

    As a child i adored this movie, in particular the TV series as well, my favourite character in the TV series was between zac (the black ranger), and of course tommy (the white ranger), also known as the green ranger to some people. I had first heard about this movie in the year 1999, when i did i was only 7 years old, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie at first and have so ever since,the storyline is perfect along with the perfectly choreographed fight scenes. Overall i felt that this movie was unfairly rated and have so ever since, i even decided to watch this movie as a teenager and still felt that this movie deserved a much better rating than its current one. Movies such as "Les Miserables", "Star Trek" (2009), "Harry Potter", "Life of Pi", "The King's Speech", the list is endless, and also a surprise to see such high ratings for movies that deserve far much less of an overall rating. The thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this movie was made in the year 1995, the technology we have now was not made available to movie studios back then, and even so if they were it required the producer to pay a large sum of money, the point is this, when taking into consideration the year and the tools available, you have to understand that this was a really good, nostalgic movie and deserved a much higher rating. I like the movie, millions of other people also like the movie, the point of this review, is to let people know that you should not always follow the rating but instead try to read people's submitted articles as they, the people writing them are the ones telling the actual truth. My Rating: 8.0/10

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I wish i could give you a hard slap in the face. this was our childhoods. this was out life. this was us. power rangers, and especially these six were some of the most influential people in my life. yeah that sounds silly now. but we were 5 YEARS OLD or so. every damn critique on IMDb is coming from people who said they loved it, but now that they watched it as adults, saw how corny and childish it was. NO FU&Ccedil;KING SHI. I honestly can't believe the stupidity from some people. its meant for kids. and this was glorious. everything about this movie and the other originals deserve so much more regard. it saddens me that this movie is tarnished for such a bad rating. i just watched it again and it filled me up with so many good memories i can't even explain it. stupid people.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

    As a child i adored this movie, in particular the TV series as well, my favourite character in the TV series was between zac (the black ranger), and of course tommy (the white ranger), also known as the green ranger to some people. I had first heard about this movie in the year 1999, when i did i was only 7 years old, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie at first and have so ever since,the storyline is perfect along with the perfectly choreographed fight scenes. Overall i felt that this movie was unfairly rated and have so ever since, i even decided to watch this movie as a teenager and still felt that this movie deserved a much better rating than its current one. Movies such as "Les Miserables", "Star Trek" (2009), "Harry Potter", "Life of Pi", "The King's Speech", the list is endless, and also a surprise to see such high ratings for movies that deserve far much less of an overall rating. The thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this movie was made in the year 1995, the technology we have now was not made available to movie studios back then, and even so if they were it required the producer to pay a large sum of money, the point is this, when taking into consideration the year and the tools available, you have to understand that this was a really good, nostalgic movie and deserved a much higher rating. I like the movie, millions of other people also like the movie, the point of this review, is to let people know that you should not always follow the rating but instead try to read people's submitted articles as they, the people writing them are the ones telling the actual truth. My Rating: 8.0/10

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I wish i could give you a hard slap in the face. this was our childhoods. this was out life. this was us. power rangers, and especially these six were some of the most influential people in my life. yeah that sounds silly now. but we were 5 YEARS OLD or so. every damn critique on IMDb is coming from people who said they loved it, but now that they watched it as adults, saw how corny and childish it was. NO FU&Ccedil;KING SHI. I honestly can't believe the stupidity from some people. its meant for kids. and this was glorious. everything about this movie and the other originals deserve so much more regard. it saddens me that this movie is tarnished for such a bad rating. i just watched it again and it filled me up with so many good memories i can't even explain it. stupid people.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

    ....is with a group of people saying witty things after each character says them on the screen, mockingly...and that's what I and some people did when we saw this movie one night in Toronto! We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway. As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

    As a child i adored this movie, in particular the TV series as well, my favourite character in the TV series was between zac (the black ranger), and of course tommy (the white ranger), also known as the green ranger to some people. I had first heard about this movie in the year 1999, when i did i was only 7 years old, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie at first and have so ever since,the storyline is perfect along with the perfectly choreographed fight scenes. Overall i felt that this movie was unfairly rated and have so ever since, i even decided to watch this movie as a teenager and still felt that this movie deserved a much better rating than its current one. Movies such as "Les Miserables", "Star Trek" (2009), "Harry Potter", "Life of Pi", "The King's Speech", the list is endless, and also a surprise to see such high ratings for movies that deserve far much less of an overall rating. The thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this movie was made in the year 1995, the technology we have now was not made available to movie studios back then, and even so if they were it required the producer to pay a large sum of money, the point is this, when taking into consideration the year and the tools available, you have to understand that this was a really good, nostalgic movie and deserved a much higher rating. I like the movie, millions of other people also like the movie, the point of this review, is to let people know that you should not always follow the rating but instead try to read people's submitted articles as they, the people writing them are the ones telling the actual truth. My Rating: 8.0/10

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I wish i could give you a hard slap in the face. this was our childhoods. this was out life. this was us. power rangers, and especially these six were some of the most influential people in my life. yeah that sounds silly now. but we were 5 YEARS OLD or so. every damn critique on IMDb is coming from people who said they loved it, but now that they watched it as adults, saw how corny and childish it was. NO FU&Ccedil;KING SHI. I honestly can't believe the stupidity from some people. its meant for kids. and this was glorious. everything about this movie and the other originals deserve so much more regard. it saddens me that this movie is tarnished for such a bad rating. i just watched it again and it filled me up with so many good memories i can't even explain it. stupid people.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

    ....is with a group of people saying witty things after each character says them on the screen, mockingly...and that's what I and some people did when we saw this movie one night in Toronto! We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway. As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

The thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this movie was made in the year 1995, the technology we have now was not made available to movie studios back then, and even so if they were it required the producer to pay a large sum of money, the point is this, when taking into consideration the year and the tools available, you have to understand that this was a really good, nostalgic movie and deserved a much higher rating. I like the movie, millions of other people also like the movie, the point of this review, is to let people know that you should not always follow the rating but instead try to read people's submitted articles as they, the people writing them are the ones telling the actual truth. My Rating: 8.0/10

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I wish i could give you a hard slap in the face. this was our childhoods. this was out life. this was us. power rangers, and especially these six were some of the most influential people in my life. yeah that sounds silly now. but we were 5 YEARS OLD or so. every damn critique on IMDb is coming from people who said they loved it, but now that they watched it as adults, saw how corny and childish it was. NO FU&Ccedil;KING SHI. I honestly can't believe the stupidity from some people. its meant for kids. and this was glorious. everything about this movie and the other originals deserve so much more regard. it saddens me that this movie is tarnished for such a bad rating. i just watched it again and it filled me up with so many good memories i can't even explain it. stupid people.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

    ....is with a group of people saying witty things after each character says them on the screen, mockingly...and that's what I and some people did when we saw this movie one night in Toronto! We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway. As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

    As a child i adored this movie, in particular the TV series as well, my favourite character in the TV series was between zac (the black ranger), and of course tommy (the white ranger), also known as the green ranger to some people. I had first heard about this movie in the year 1999, when i did i was only 7 years old, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie at first and have so ever since,the storyline is perfect along with the perfectly choreographed fight scenes. Overall i felt that this movie was unfairly rated and have so ever since, i even decided to watch this movie as a teenager and still felt that this movie deserved a much better rating than its current one. Movies such as "Les Miserables", "Star Trek" (2009), "Harry Potter", "Life of Pi", "The King's Speech", the list is endless, and also a surprise to see such high ratings for movies that deserve far much less of an overall rating.

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I wish i could give you a hard slap in the face. this was our childhoods. this was out life. this was us. power rangers, and especially these six were some of the most influential people in my life. yeah that sounds silly now. but we were 5 YEARS OLD or so. every damn critique on IMDb is coming from people who said they loved it, but now that they watched it as adults, saw how corny and childish it was. NO FU&Ccedil;KING SHI. I honestly can't believe the stupidity from some people. its meant for kids. and this was glorious. everything about this movie and the other originals deserve so much more regard. it saddens me that this movie is tarnished for such a bad rating. i just watched it again and it filled me up with so many good memories i can't even explain it. stupid people.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

    ....is with a group of people saying witty things after each character says them on the screen, mockingly...and that's what I and some people did when we saw this movie one night in Toronto! We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway. As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

    As a child i adored this movie, in particular the TV series as well, my favourite character in the TV series was between zac (the black ranger), and of course tommy (the white ranger), also known as the green ranger to some people. I had first heard about this movie in the year 1999, when i did i was only 7 years old, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie at first and have so ever since,the storyline is perfect along with the perfectly choreographed fight scenes. Overall i felt that this movie was unfairly rated and have so ever since, i even decided to watch this movie as a teenager and still felt that this movie deserved a much better rating than its current one. Movies such as "Les Miserables", "Star Trek" (2009), "Harry Potter", "Life of Pi", "The King's Speech", the list is endless, and also a surprise to see such high ratings for movies that deserve far much less of an overall rating. The thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this movie was made in the year 1995, the technology we have now was not made available to movie studios back then, and even so if they were it required the producer to pay a large sum of money, the point is this, when taking into consideration the year and the tools available, you have to understand that this was a really good, nostalgic movie and deserved a much higher rating. I like the movie, millions of other people also like the movie, the point of this review, is to let people know that you should not always follow the rating but instead try to read people's submitted articles as they, the people writing them are the ones telling the actual truth. My Rating: 8.0/10

    Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was one of my favorite shows growing up. I mean, come on, it's a bunch of teenagers in spandex beating the crap out of giant rubber monsters. It's the ultimate cheese fest from the 90s and was at one point one of the most watched kids shows in history. What many people don't know about MMPR and the quadrillion seasons that would follow is that they used stock footage from a Japanese TV series called Super Sentai (in the case of MMPR, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger). The only thing the Americans added was the cutscenes with the American actors as well as Zordon and Alpha 5. By Season 2, they created Lord Zedd and while stock footage was used from subsequent Sentai series, they still stuck with the Zyuranger costumes for the Rangers. Then in 1995, Saban Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to bring us Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, a completely Americanized motion picture based upon the Sentai series. While many consider this film a dud, many have come to admire this film for the cornball that it is and the film has since become a cult following. What are my thoughts on the movie. I love it, I love it, I love it! I know the film stands apart from the TV show's continuity and that the CGI effects aren't that great by today's standards, but there's just something about this movie that screams childhood. 18 years after the film's release, I still have the VHS tape in my possession and once in a while, I pop it in and I'm instantly taken back to the mid 90s. My cousins and I obsessed over this movie and I got jealous of my one cousin because he had the Ninja Megazord toy and I didn't. Still, I'll never forget the first time I saw this picture and watching it to this day, I can honestly say that it's a pretty decent flick, a campy cluster of cottage cheese from the convoluted 90s (let that alliteration sink in for a moment). The actors who play the six main Power Rangers are not the greatest of actors by any means, but they're portraying teenagers with superpowers, what do you expect? The Ranger suits are more of an armor instead of the spandex like on the show and if they one day decide to reboot MMPR like they did with Transformers and Star Trek, I hope they use suits like the ones in this movie. In fact, why didn't they just use these suits for the metallic armor on the TV show instead of those crappy glitter suits? I'm sure they were available in Saban's inventory, why not just use them? Oh well. The actor who steals the show is Paul Freeman as the main villain Ivan Ooze. Revived after six thousand years of rotting in a giant pink egg, Ivan Ooze is a mix between Jack Nicholson's Joker and Freddy Krueger. Also, I think his character design is brilliant. He's got this slick, slimy purple look to him. He is made of slime after all! It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played Belloq in Raiders of the Lost Arks. Who knew Freeman was such a hilarious guy! Anyway, Ivan Ooze is so powerful that he ransacks the Command Center with his magical flute and temporarily defeats Zordon. As the Rangers set out to find the Great Power which will save Zordon and give them back their ranger abilities, Ivan Ooze imprisons Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa in a tiny snow globe and enslaves the parents of Angel Grove with his canisters of purple gunk. What an elaborate plan for a goofball of an adversary. I'd like to see this guy go up against Hades from Disney's Hercules. On the planet Phaedos, the Rangers embark on a dangerous quest to get the Great Power. After a sorceress named Dulcea (who looks like one of Jabba the Hutt's slave girls) gives them the powers of a ninja, the rangers travel to the monolith which holds the power. Along the way, they encounter the deranged skeleton of a dinosaur as well as a couple of stone monsters. After defeating them and getting the Great Power, they return to Earth and for some reason, they decide to take out Ivan Ooze and his giant robots before going to the Command Center to revive Zordon. Why would they do that? It's one of the film's most noticeable plot holes, but it doesn't take away from the good goofiness of the movie. The climax in which the Rangers take on Ivan Ooze in their new Megazord is not the greatest of climaxes, but it's a neat final battle to tie up loose ends. It's also one of the few times an enemy is defeated by being knocked in the crotch and sent into an incoming comet. It's a decent conclusion to a decent movie that will intrigue Power Rangers fans for many years to come. Happy 20th anniversary MMPR!

    So this film isn't well received on this site. I don't know why and I don't care. I just know that this movie is a pretty good film for every Power Rangers fan. I don't know why non ranger fans would watch this in the first place, but one actually could. I don't know if this is in the same universe as the show or not and I really don't think that matters to enjoy this film. While most TV shows want to turn into movies, they have the problem of just making a movie into a very long episode. This is not the case (although some might argue with me). This is a very unique film. There may be a least one obvious plot hole but it isn't big enough to not be important and prevent you from liking the movie. I find this to be very enjoyable and hope that everyone who liked the series to watch and own this film.

    I remembered seeing this show as a kid and hating it for it's bizarre characters and over-the-top cheesiness. (This coming from someone who liked to watch shows like Captain Planet and the Planeteers.) Anyways,I still remembered seeing this movie and just had to pick it up again. I like to do to gauge how things have changed and see if movies like this still hold up to ones now. The movie was just like the show just longer and zero commercials. However, I did enjoy seeing Bulk and Skull and their witticism. I also thought the movie had great cinematography and the characters were well-done. But, I do have some questions like why does Ivan Ooze make one of the parent zombie dance? To me, this is kind of unnecessary. But, that's Power Rangers. Anyways, a part that I liked a lot was with warrior girl. Even in a cheesy show such as this,She was completely a kick-butt, karate-fighting girl and I love her for it. Girl Power! Now, for another part that unnerved me was with the kid that showed at the beginning of the movie gave this nice,tender, speech to all the kids to convince them to save their parents from Ivan Ooze. Is it me or would you just kind of ignore this speech. Overall, I thought this movie was still awesome with the nice easy- to-dance music and some kick-butt,girl power. I still dislike the Power rangers show, but at least the movie was good and gave me a nice night of old nostalgia. So, it earns a 6 out of 10 from me.

    This movie is all about the White Ranger. He's got the looks, the skills, and the 'tude. The fine momma Pink Ranger is ALL over his junk. The Power Rangers are wimps, they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Especially the females. The whole movie consists of them just getting' WORKED until the White Ranger pulls it together for the team and lays down the hammer on some sorry fools. At one point, when the Morphin Teenagers are fighting a boss, my boy the White Ranger yells "FLYING CORKSCREW KICK!" torpedos off a tree at blinding speed, and inexplicably starts spinning in mid-air. The kick destroys everything. So cool. Then this ancient evil bad boy named Ivan Ooze tries to take over the world and just jacks up the Ranger's pad. Their leader Zordon faints or something wimpy like that, and everyone loses their super cool Mighty Morphin powers. Which don't mean a thang to my boy Tommy Oliver (the White Ranger). He still Pummels the bad guys, no sweat, gets the whole team their powers back. Ivan ain't havin' it, so he tries to fight them as a giant robot. You know what happens next. Worst CGI in the history of Earth. Worse than even the CGI in the spawn movie. Worse than Xena Warrior Princess CGI. The Power Ranger TV show looks better when they're just in monster and robot costumes. So bad. I don't even know why Ivan wanted to go toe-to-toe with the Rangers when he has the power to magically trap people in tiny snow globes. Whatev. In the end the White Ranger saves the day, and celebrates by tapping the Pink Ranger's booty (off-screen).

    The original Power Rangers Movie.. what can I say? If it's illegal for someone who worked on the film to review it then I guess this review is a bad one, but to everyone else I'll give a different view, especially now that I have kids of my own who just watched it and loved it. To start with. One thing makes this film bearable to watch again and again. Paul Freeman as Ivan Ooze. A great baddie really makes a superhero film and Freeman is up there with the best of them in MMPR:TM. But to move beyond the critique of stories, actors and effects we need to consider this film for the landmark it is. It's in the same box as things like "Tron" (1982). Sort of "How dare they" and "what were they on" and even "how much money can you throw at something to make it work"? MMPR:TM is a visual feast. The locations are fantastic and the designs truly unique. It represents the first time anyone, anywhere had attempted to make a film this way. Most of all it stands as a cornerstone in the side of the Australian film industry which created it. Before MMPR:TM, this barnyard rabble was a disjointed collection of individuals living off crumbs and making films about things nobody really wanted to know about. After MMPR:TM things were very different in Sydney - and this collection of film makers and crew who had "passed through hell together" went on to forge it's own stamp on the international film screen. MMPR:TM was a pivotal cog in the "golden age of Sydney film making" spanning a period of about 10 years from 1992(beginning with the very successful "Babe") to 2002 (basically finishing up with "Superman returns".) In between, it bought forth things like the successful Wachowski "Matrix" films, the somewhat forgetful but pretty Babe sequel, Alex Proyas' ingenious "Dark City", the indulgent "Mission Impossible 2", the Oscar winning "Moulin Rouge" and of course the final two "Star Wars" prequels. All these films bow down to MMPR:TM for without the Power Rangers, none of this would have happened. Even the Sydney Olympics opening and closing ceremonies (long recognised as the "best ever") in 2000 have much to thank this same creative team of individuals for. People who met for the first time at the Sydney Showgrounds in 1994 working on some crazy film about coloured superheroes. So as you watch the Power Rangers Movie - remember that you're not just watching some old kids' film. You're watching the birth of greatness. The lighting of a bright torch "down under" that would live to burn on for many years before being extinguished by the troubled winds of financial disaster which now has the Aussie $1 riding at US$1.07, instead of the very respectable $0.64 average it enjoyed during those "Golden Years" of Sydney film making. And remember to watch carefully and see if you can see who'se holding up the "Celebration Tonight" sign at the very end, won't you :-) Zordmaker

    ....is with a group of people saying witty things after each character says them on the screen, mockingly...and that's what I and some people did when we saw this movie one night in Toronto! We were the only ones seeing this movie at night (nobody else was there) and so we proceeded to mock the movie, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) style, We had a ball doing so, and so we were able to enjoy this movie. It's a tragedy that none of us had the Professional Walkman, or we could have recorded the whole session, but as the theater had Dolby Surround, it most likely would have drowned out our voices anyway. As for the movie? It's your typical Power Rangers episode, except brought to the big screen, and with big production values than the TV series (which as everybody knows consists of using the original Japanese effects shown when the characters get into their Zords to kick bad guy butt), but not more than that (except for what seems to be a small tender moment between Kimberly and Tommy!) The movie appeals to KIDS, NOT adults, and should be taken in that spirit when seen on the big screen or at home. Those adults and young teenagers who love the Super Sentai/tokomatsu genre might go for it as well though, too-there's no accounting for taste. As it is, I'm giving this movie just five stars-not really bad, but not super great either; something to enjoy on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon (and also great to run as a kid's matin&eacute;e some days.)

    First off, I have to say that I enjoyed the Power Rangers TV show as a kid. I missed this movie when it came out at cinemas and the preview stuck in my mind for years. It looked like a fun, silly movie. Power Rangers has always been heavy with cheese. It's a very cheesy franchise. It starts out with the team skydiving, followed by roller-blading. I haven't seen Power Rangers in a while but I'd forgotten they're adrenaline junkies. I found this funny and enjoyed it. Shortly after, a new villain, much more evil and powerful than the previous evil guy is unearthed by idiot earth-folk - Ivan Ooze. Ooze has the power of slime at his disposal (reminded me of Ghostbusters). Good stuff! (At no point does he appear more threatening than the previous guy, Lord Zed). Ooze effortlessly breaks into Zordon's lair (the Power Ranger's headquarters) and destroys all of the equipment + Zordon. Power Rangers have never really been about plot so nothing strange going on here. This is where it becomes a blur. With this new evil bad guy, comes new evil henchmen - slime-monster men. The power rangers fight them in an underground car-park. Compared to a monster-fight from the TV show the fights are really pathetic, I think because they're so dragged out. A funny bit worth mentioning - its dark in this car-park and Tommy suggests they need light. The Yellow ranger gets right on it by summoning her power-light (it actually had a cool name) and the top of her helmet lights up like a child's torch, which does bugger all to the darkness. I expected a blinding high-beam. Their powers fade soon after. Confused and unable to contact Zordon, they make their way to headquarters seeing Ooze's dirty work. Zordon is dying but they learn from Alpha (Zordon's robot assistant) that on a far away planet/dimension, lies a great power, specifically for them. They go there. They're attacked by Ooze's crow-monsters which overpower them, although they don't look threatening at all compared to some of the other things the Power Rangers have fought (Roman soldier pig and mantis-thing). An Amazonian woman steps in (native to this land) and gets rid of them, learns of the dying Zordon, Ivan Ooze and gives the rangers some new power-animals. The Power Rangers head towards a 'power-monolith' shortly after (the home of the great power, specifically for them) and are attacked by a dino-skeleton, only to run to a temple (the power-monolith?) and get attacked by more things. I turned it off here because I really couldn't sit through anymore. I wanted to.. just so I could see the robot battle at the end. The Power Rangers move around like a pack of dogs. Individuality (besides their colours) or character development are not something you'll see. As a TV show, it's perfect : Peace - bad guy - fight bad guy - bad guy increases in size - kill bad guy - peace again + cheesy life lesson (eg. remember not to punch yourself in the face). Drag this out over an hour and a half with more visual nonsense and it just gets boring. 20 minutes is more than a full dose of Power Rangers. Watch an episode of the show :D

    I went through a very bleak period of almost total isolation for about eleven years. Mainly it was my own fault. In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.) However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old. Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a "rock and roll!" ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to! The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character. Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap: given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: the Movie" was really their comeuppance, though: I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget! On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites. Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this: while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.
