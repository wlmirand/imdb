    The plots have never come across as a strong suit in Fred and Ginger's films, however when everything else is so good it doesn't present much of a problem. That is the case with The Gay Divorc&eacute;e and Fred and Ginger's other films too, if you want great escapism they provide that. In regard to Fred and Ginger's films, The Gay Divorc&eacute;e is one of their best, personal ranking would be third place behind Top Hat and Swing Time(with Top Hat getting the edge, Follow the Fleet and Shall We Dance are extremely good too). The story here is thin, but one of the more cohesive and wittiest stories in their films as well. The Gay Divorc&eacute;e, if not quite so much as Swing Time, is a beautiful-looking film, the sets are ingeniously delightful with the standout being the deco Brighton and the photography shows great technical skill and sensitivity. The score is lush and often romantic-sounding thanks to Max Steiner's very distinctive musicality and arranging. And the songs are just wonderful, Night and Day is timeless but as a whole scene, visually, choreographically and song-wise, while long The Continental was the highlight. The script has plenty of warmth, wit and heart, Erik Rhodes' line about Tornetti and spaghetti raises a big chuckle. The choreography merges so well with the music and looks so athletic and poised even now, and it's matched perfectly by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers', both giving endearing performances, dancing. The supporting cast are also spot on, Erik Rhodes like he did in Top Hat comes very close to stealing the show while Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore don't disappoint. Young Betty Grable really shines too in the number Let's K-nock K-nees. In conclusion, one of Fred and Ginger's best, a really exciting start to an iconic pairing which gave way to films that are equally as good. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to love in this lavish musical comedy loosely based upon Cole Porter's 1932 show, the only movie in which Fred Astaire got to repeat his Broadway role. Only one song ("Night and Day") remains, and he has a new leading lady (Ginger Rogers replacing Claire Luce), so for their second pairing and first leads, Fred and Ginger entered film immortality. There's plenty of silliness to be had, a few lavish production numbers, and yet all results in a romantic film that has gone on to movie immortality. The basic storyline has American attorney Fred Astaire chasing the girl (Rogers), not realizing that his partner (Edward Everett Horton) is the attorney in her divorce case. She's at first annoyed by them (he catches her in a precarious predicament), and he actually stalks her for a bit, but once they break the ice (with "Night and Day"), she begins to warm up to him. But when she mistakingly believes that he's the hired correspondent paid to help her get the divorce, more confusion ensues until the correct one (the hysterical Erik Rhodes) shows up with his concertina. Alice Brady has some of the funniest dumb lines in movie history, her malapropisms filled with innuendo. Droll Eric Blore adds more amusement as the hotel waiter with Betty Grable coming on for a delightful song and dance number ("Let's K-Nock K-Nees") with Horton. It's clear that there's a future star in this delightful peppy youngster, yet it took 6 years before she would find success in lavish color musicals over at 20th Century Fox. As for "The Continental", it is set up nicely, although I laughed more at the fact that Astaire had a pair of paper scissors on him and could take a page out of a magazine and make it stand up on a record player to provide a shadow for him and Rogers while they went out and danced without Rhodes' knowledge. The production number goes on forever, but is so delightful that it really doesn't matter, seeming more like a music video with its brunette dancers in black dresses and blonde dancers in white dresses.

    After causing a sensation in Flying Down to Rio with their dance sequence there, RKO decided to give Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers a whole movie to themselves the following year. This would eventually lead to a series of films starring them to mostly great box office results. As it was, this would be the first time that Astaire would pursue Ms. Rogers with the latter resisting at first before a mistaken identity plot also takes effect. The comedy involving them and supporting players like Alice Brady, Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, and Erik Rhodes was funny enough to me but it's really the songs and dances that really makes these movies enjoyable enough for repeat viewings. The "Night & Day" sequence, especially, really puts the Astaire-Rogers dance numbers in full force and the later one called "The Continental" provides some fun among other dancers not to mention a now-forgotten singer named Lilian Miles. Oh, and Betty Grable-who was 17 at the time-also does a fine number called "Let's K-nock K-nees" with Horton who seemed game enough. Really, all I'll say now is The Gay Divorc&eacute;e is well worth seeing for the emergence of the classic movie dance team of Astaire & Rogers! Trivia note: William Austin, who plays Ginger's husband she's trying to divorce, eventually played Alfred the butler in the Batman serials in the '40s. His look there would eventually inspire DC Comics to change their previous physical look for Alfred to one that's thin and has facial hair.

    Well, Fred and Ginger were really beautiful together. Try to imagine this: clean, very clean environments with some evocativeartificial horizons, here a seaside resort, lovers who are destined but fate dredges up all sorts of dreamlike illusion to keep apart, a plot that emphasizes both fate and multilayered worry about hidden selves, the illusion (the worry) conquered with persistent love and expressed with dance. And yet, what a striking thing that it doesn't work like noir, where fate and hidden selves play a similar function; the difference is that the viewer has too much control over the players and plot. Is this why it registers like magic? We trust that all is going to turn out well.. Like Fred's character, we persist with the story because we feel safe and happy that it will all turn up for the better. From this pov, mishap thrown up by the gods is not as in noir the cause of anxious hallucination, but small, glittering bubbles of fate. Of course it is all so sunny, because the protagonist is, and is unafraid to take chancesthis infectious radiance colors the world. Top Hat is much more intricate, because you have two characters doubled with several more layers, here just one. This is easier to digest, more fun.

    The movie musical had been a Hollywood staple since the dawn of the talkies, but after a few years the novelty of the all-singing picture was wearing off and the studios had to refresh the genre with new tricks and, most crucially, popular stars. Old hand Al Jolson had reinvented his image, Bing Crosby was a fresh-faced newcomer, but most successful of all was the duo of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This was their second appearance together, and the first where they were the lead players and main attraction. The two of them were rather different in background. Astaire had already been an established star on the stage and having worked with Ziegfeld was very much in touch with that passing generation of theatrical extravaganza, but he was a newcomer to cinema. Rogers on the other hand already had two-dozen movie credits to her name, and had gained a reputation in small roles, often as a catty, antagonistic chorine. But despite their differences they have in common an approach to dancing that, despite professional precision, brings out a lot of personality. And both can act. Ginger would later prove herself to be an excellent dramatic actress, and is steady enough here. Fred just has an easygoing charm that seems as effortless as his dancing. In a non-musical, these two would seem an odd pairing  it's when they dance we see them click. But these were early days yet, and in The Gay Divorc&eacute;e they lack that sense of familiarity around each other that would make their later romances seem so right. This was also the first time Astaire and Rogers were put before director Mark Sandrich, the man who helmed their most successful features together. Sandrich keeps a sort of gentle rhythm going throughout the picture with some delicate camera moves, such as the opening sweep through the restaurant onto Astaire's dancing fingers. His approach to the musical numbers was always oblique yet effective. For "Needle in a Haystack", the song is born out of a dialogue scene, with the camera still in its place, the sofa in the foreground separating us from Astaire, who (very unusually) is framed in profile. After one verse, the angle changes to place us in front of him. The camera then follows him as he gets up and selects a tie from a valet, and the dance just segues out of that movement. Sandrich's ability to make the songs flow seamlessly in and out of the non-music scenes was a key part in the ongoing revolution in how musicals were made. One thing that makes a musical like The Gay Divorc&eacute;e seem somewhat archaic is its plot. It's a comedy of errors that might have been quite good had it been fully developed as one, but the way the narrative twists to fit a song it becomes obviously artificial. It also suffers from an unpleasant quality of many romances of the era, in that the "romance" basically consists of the man stalking and harassing the woman until, against all probability, she falls for him (and not even the suave Mister Astaire can stop this from appearing creepy). The only thing that saves this from being a handful of noteworthy song-and-dance routines strung together with a limp story is the often witty dialogue and the way it is delivered by a wonderful supporting cast. Just as Fred and Ginger established their screen persona, so too did Edward Everett Horton become the fussy, mother-hen sidekick, Eric Blore the chirpy, intrusive butler and Erik Rhodes the bungling would-be Latin lover. These three are all excellent and, with the romantic interplay between Astaire and Rogers not quite as fizzing as it should be, dare I say they even overshadow the two leads? (Yes, I do dare say).

    After staying in Paris on vacation, the American dancer Guy Holden (Fred Astaire) and his Londoner lawyer friend Egbert Fitzgerald (Edward Everett Horton) return to London by ship. Guy meets the wealthy American blonde Mimi Glossop (Ginger Rogers), who is traveling with her aunt Hortense Ditherwell (Alice Brady), in the harbor and Mimi asks him to call her aunt to open her luggage since her dress is trapped in the trunk. Guy tries to release her dress but he accidentally rips Mimi's dress. Guy lends his overcoat to her expecting to receive it back with a thank-you note with her name and address, but Mimi returns the coat without any card. Meanwhile, Hortense seeks out Egbert, who is replacing his father in the office, expecting to get the divorce of Mimi and her husband, the geologist Cyril Glossop (William Austin). However, Cyril advises that it would be difficult to make Cyryl accepting the divorce and he suggest to Mimi to hire the "correspondent" Rodolfo Tonettito (Erik Rhodes) to stay with her in a hotel room. Meanwhile, Egbert would hire private eyes to arrive in Mimi's room and surprise the couple, forcing the divorce of Mimi and Cyril. Egbert gives a password to Tonettito to identify Mimi and uses a sentence created by Guy  "Chance Is the Fool's Name for Fate". Mimi believes that Guy is her correspondent and stays with him in her room. When Tonettito arrives in her room, the disappointed Mimi learns the truth and feels better. But she is still married and can not marry Guy. "The Gay Divorc&eacute;e" is a great classic musical, with Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire shining and dancing. The long song "The Continental" was awarded with the Oscar of Best Music in 1935 and it is delightful to see the choreography of the dance. In IMDb Trivia, there are interesting information about this film that I will not repeat in my review. In addiction, Ginger Rogers drives the mighty Duesenberg Model J, one of the most popular luxury cars as well as a status symbol in the United States and Europe. This car that cost between US$ 20,000.00 to US$ 25,000.00 in 1935 was driven by Clark Gable and Gary Cooper (the rare model SSJ 125), Al Capone, Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, Mae West, Tyrone Power among others personalities. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "A Alegre Divorciada" ("The Gay Divorc&eacute;e")

    I was really lucky to catch this film when it was being shown, I only missed the first two minutes, had I of known it was the first film starring the famous dancing star couple together I wouldn't have ignored it, thank goodness I spotted it, from director Amrk Sandrich (Top Hat, Shall We Dance). Basically in Brightbourne, Brighton, England arrives Mimi Glossop (Ginger Rogers) from America who seeks a divorce from her geologist husband Cyril (William Austin) who she hasn't seen for several years. Her domineering Aunt Hortense (Alice Brady), who has been married numerous times herself, is there to give her guidance and get bumbling and slightly incompetent lawyer Egbert 'Pinky' Fitzgerald (Edward Everett Horton) to consult them, he also happens to a former fianc&eacute;. He tries to get an adulterous relationship started as they spend a night in the hotel he found them, and professional co-respondent Rodolfo Tonetti (Erik Rhodes) is who he has hired to try and make it happen. He forgets though to hire private detectives to "catch them in the act", leaving Mimi free to do whatever she wants, and coincidently she again meets American dancer Guy Holden (Fred Astaire), they met briefly on her arrival. Guy is a friend of Egbert's and is now besotted with Mimi staying in the same hotel, and he is also mistaken as the co-respondent she is meant to be caught with. They are eventually caught by Tonetti who "holds them prisoner" as they wait to clear up the mess, and Cyril also arrives to speak his mind about the situation, but in the end Guy and Mimi escape to dance the night away and live happily ever after. Also starring Eric Blore as The Waiter, Lillian Miles as Singer, Continental Number, Charles Coleman as Guy's Valet and Betty Grable as Dance Specialty. Astaire is lovable and charming, Rogers is beautiful and innocent, and together their scenes are filled with fantastic chemistry, the film is has of course wonderful songs, with the Oscar winning "The Continental", "Night and Day", "Let's K-nock K-nees" and "A Needle In A Haystack", the dialogue is witty and funny which creates most of the best jokes, overall a delightful musical comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Music for Max Steiner, Best Sound and Best Picture. Fred Astaire was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Ginger Rogers was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women. Very good!

    Ginger's aunt concocts a scheme to get her out of her unhappy marriage, but complications arise. This film became the template for all the Astaire-Rogers films to follow - a silly plot involving mistaken identities, snappy musical numbers, and supporting cast featuring some combination of scene stealers Horton, Blore, and Rhodes. The formula would be perfected the following year with "Top Hat," but this is entertaining enough in its own right. The big musical number is "The Continental," which is enjoyable despite going on for more than 17 minutes. Sandrich directs the first of his five Astaire-Rogers films, borrowing a few tricks from Busby Berkeley.

    I've got to say, it took me a while to work up the courage to borrow 'The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934)' from the university library. Fortunately, I balanced things out by also renting the steamy neo-noir 'Body Heat (1981)!' Needless to say, my ill-ease was not necessary. The 1930s was a carefree and innocent time for American cinema, and here I can assure the reader that the divorc&eacute;e indicated by the title is merely happy. The film (my ninth from Astaire and Rogers) was the pair's second collaboration, and the first in which they were the stars. The story, adapted from the musical play "Gay Divorce," pretty much forms the template for their next half-dozen outings, a throwaway love-story fraught with screwball misunderstandings and elaborate art deco hotel- rooms. Ginger Rogers requires a divorce from her neglectful husband, and so tries to fake a love-affair (as you do) with a pompous Italian called Tonetti (Erik Rhodes). Fred Astaire comes along, falls in love with Ginger, but she mistakes him for the guy with whom she's supposed to be faking a love-affair. 'The Gay Divorc&eacute;e' has an excellent cast. Fred Astaire, of course, exudes the same classiness and boyish charm that made him the stand-out in 'Flying Down to Rio (1933)' -- and just check out how gracefully he is able to dance and get dressed at the same time. Ginger Rogers, ever the gifted comedienne, shows wonderful composure, effortlessly making the conversion from apathy towards her male co-star to adoration. Edward Everett Horton, whose constant huffiness bounces amusingly off the carefree Astaire, is unfortunate enough to be given a dance number (opposite Betty Grable), through which he awkwardly and hilariously stumbles. Erik Rhodes, who was the highlight of 'Top Hat (1935),' again manages to steal the show, his pompous Italian "womaniser" a constant source of amusement. There's also Eric Blore, doing that butler thing he does best. Musical highlights include "Night and Day" and the Oscar- winning "Continental," which briefly abandons the long-takes you'd usually find in an Astaire film, instead lapsing into a rapid-fire Eisensteinian montage.

Old hand Al Jolson had reinvented his image, Bing Crosby was a fresh-faced newcomer, but most successful of all was the duo of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This was their second appearance together, and the first where they were the lead players and main attraction. The two of them were rather different in background. Astaire had already been an established star on the stage and having worked with Ziegfeld was very much in touch with that passing generation of theatrical extravaganza, but he was a newcomer to cinema. Rogers on the other hand already had two-dozen movie credits to her name, and had gained a reputation in small roles, often as a catty, antagonistic chorine. But despite their differences they have in common an approach to dancing that, despite professional precision, brings out a lot of personality. And both can act. Ginger would later prove herself to be an excellent dramatic actress, and is steady enough here. Fred just has an easygoing charm that seems as effortless as his dancing. In a non-musical, these two would seem an odd pairing  it's when they dance we see them click. But these were early days yet, and in The Gay Divorc&eacute;e they lack that sense of familiarity around each other that would make their later romances seem so right. This was also the first time Astaire and Rogers were put before director Mark Sandrich, the man who helmed their most successful features together. Sandrich keeps a sort of gentle rhythm going throughout the picture with some delicate camera moves, such as the opening sweep through the restaurant onto Astaire's dancing fingers. His approach to the musical numbers was always oblique yet effective. For "Needle in a Haystack", the song is born out of a dialogue scene, with the camera still in its place, the sofa in the foreground separating us from Astaire, who (very unusually) is framed in profile. After one verse, the angle changes to place us in front of him. The camera then follows him as he gets up and selects a tie from a valet, and the dance just segues out of that movement. Sandrich's ability to make the songs flow seamlessly in and out of the non-music scenes was a key part in the ongoing revolution in how musicals were made. One thing that makes a musical like The Gay Divorc&eacute;e seem somewhat archaic is its plot. It's a comedy of errors that might have been quite good had it been fully developed as one, but the way the narrative twists to fit a song it becomes obviously artificial. It also suffers from an unpleasant quality of many romances of the era, in that the "romance" basically consists of the man stalking and harassing the woman until, against all probability, she falls for him (and not even the suave Mister Astaire can stop this from appearing creepy). The only thing that saves this from being a handful of noteworthy song-and-dance routines strung together with a limp story is the often witty dialogue and the way it is delivered by a wonderful supporting cast. Just as Fred and Ginger established their screen persona, so too did Edward Everett Horton become the fussy, mother-hen sidekick, Eric Blore the chirpy, intrusive butler and Erik Rhodes the bungling would-be Latin lover. These three are all excellent and, with the romantic interplay between Astaire and Rogers not quite as fizzing as it should be, dare I say they even overshadow the two leads? (Yes, I do dare say).

    After staying in Paris on vacation, the American dancer Guy Holden (Fred Astaire) and his Londoner lawyer friend Egbert Fitzgerald (Edward Everett Horton) return to London by ship. Guy meets the wealthy American blonde Mimi Glossop (Ginger Rogers), who is traveling with her aunt Hortense Ditherwell (Alice Brady), in the harbor and Mimi asks him to call her aunt to open her luggage since her dress is trapped in the trunk. Guy tries to release her dress but he accidentally rips Mimi's dress. Guy lends his overcoat to her expecting to receive it back with a thank-you note with her name and address, but Mimi returns the coat without any card. Meanwhile, Hortense seeks out Egbert, who is replacing his father in the office, expecting to get the divorce of Mimi and her husband, the geologist Cyril Glossop (William Austin). However, Cyril advises that it would be difficult to make Cyryl accepting the divorce and he suggest to Mimi to hire the "correspondent" Rodolfo Tonettito (Erik Rhodes) to stay with her in a hotel room. Meanwhile, Egbert would hire private eyes to arrive in Mimi's room and surprise the couple, forcing the divorce of Mimi and Cyril. Egbert gives a password to Tonettito to identify Mimi and uses a sentence created by Guy  "Chance Is the Fool's Name for Fate". Mimi believes that Guy is her correspondent and stays with him in her room. When Tonettito arrives in her room, the disappointed Mimi learns the truth and feels better. But she is still married and can not marry Guy. "The Gay Divorc&eacute;e" is a great classic musical, with Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire shining and dancing. The long song "The Continental" was awarded with the Oscar of Best Music in 1935 and it is delightful to see the choreography of the dance. In IMDb Trivia, there are interesting information about this film that I will not repeat in my review. In addiction, Ginger Rogers drives the mighty Duesenberg Model J, one of the most popular luxury cars as well as a status symbol in the United States and Europe. This car that cost between US$ 20,000.00 to US$ 25,000.00 in 1935 was driven by Clark Gable and Gary Cooper (the rare model SSJ 125), Al Capone, Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, Mae West, Tyrone Power among others personalities. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "A Alegre Divorciada" ("The Gay Divorc&eacute;e")

    I was really lucky to catch this film when it was being shown, I only missed the first two minutes, had I of known it was the first film starring the famous dancing star couple together I wouldn't have ignored it, thank goodness I spotted it, from director Amrk Sandrich (Top Hat, Shall We Dance). Basically in Brightbourne, Brighton, England arrives Mimi Glossop (Ginger Rogers) from America who seeks a divorce from her geologist husband Cyril (William Austin) who she hasn't seen for several years. Her domineering Aunt Hortense (Alice Brady), who has been married numerous times herself, is there to give her guidance and get bumbling and slightly incompetent lawyer Egbert 'Pinky' Fitzgerald (Edward Everett Horton) to consult them, he also happens to a former fianc&eacute;. He tries to get an adulterous relationship started as they spend a night in the hotel he found them, and professional co-respondent Rodolfo Tonetti (Erik Rhodes) is who he has hired to try and make it happen. He forgets though to hire private detectives to "catch them in the act", leaving Mimi free to do whatever she wants, and coincidently she again meets American dancer Guy Holden (Fred Astaire), they met briefly on her arrival. Guy is a friend of Egbert's and is now besotted with Mimi staying in the same hotel, and he is also mistaken as the co-respondent she is meant to be caught with. They are eventually caught by Tonetti who "holds them prisoner" as they wait to clear up the mess, and Cyril also arrives to speak his mind about the situation, but in the end Guy and Mimi escape to dance the night away and live happily ever after. Also starring Eric Blore as The Waiter, Lillian Miles as Singer, Continental Number, Charles Coleman as Guy's Valet and Betty Grable as Dance Specialty. Astaire is lovable and charming, Rogers is beautiful and innocent, and together their scenes are filled with fantastic chemistry, the film is has of course wonderful songs, with the Oscar winning "The Continental", "Night and Day", "Let's K-nock K-nees" and "A Needle In A Haystack", the dialogue is witty and funny which creates most of the best jokes, overall a delightful musical comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Music for Max Steiner, Best Sound and Best Picture. Fred Astaire was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Ginger Rogers was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women. Very good!

    Ginger's aunt concocts a scheme to get her out of her unhappy marriage, but complications arise. This film became the template for all the Astaire-Rogers films to follow - a silly plot involving mistaken identities, snappy musical numbers, and supporting cast featuring some combination of scene stealers Horton, Blore, and Rhodes. The formula would be perfected the following year with "Top Hat," but this is entertaining enough in its own right. The big musical number is "The Continental," which is enjoyable despite going on for more than 17 minutes. Sandrich directs the first of his five Astaire-Rogers films, borrowing a few tricks from Busby Berkeley.

    I've got to say, it took me a while to work up the courage to borrow 'The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934)' from the university library. Fortunately, I balanced things out by also renting the steamy neo-noir 'Body Heat (1981)!' Needless to say, my ill-ease was not necessary. The 1930s was a carefree and innocent time for American cinema, and here I can assure the reader that the divorc&eacute;e indicated by the title is merely happy. The film (my ninth from Astaire and Rogers) was the pair's second collaboration, and the first in which they were the stars. The story, adapted from the musical play "Gay Divorce," pretty much forms the template for their next half-dozen outings, a throwaway love-story fraught with screwball misunderstandings and elaborate art deco hotel- rooms. Ginger Rogers requires a divorce from her neglectful husband, and so tries to fake a love-affair (as you do) with a pompous Italian called Tonetti (Erik Rhodes). Fred Astaire comes along, falls in love with Ginger, but she mistakes him for the guy with whom she's supposed to be faking a love-affair. 'The Gay Divorc&eacute;e' has an excellent cast. Fred Astaire, of course, exudes the same classiness and boyish charm that made him the stand-out in 'Flying Down to Rio (1933)' -- and just check out how gracefully he is able to dance and get dressed at the same time. Ginger Rogers, ever the gifted comedienne, shows wonderful composure, effortlessly making the conversion from apathy towards her male co-star to adoration. Edward Everett Horton, whose constant huffiness bounces amusingly off the carefree Astaire, is unfortunate enough to be given a dance number (opposite Betty Grable), through which he awkwardly and hilariously stumbles. Erik Rhodes, who was the highlight of 'Top Hat (1935),' again manages to steal the show, his pompous Italian "womaniser" a constant source of amusement. There's also Eric Blore, doing that butler thing he does best. Musical highlights include "Night and Day" and the Oscar- winning "Continental," which briefly abandons the long-takes you'd usually find in an Astaire film, instead lapsing into a rapid-fire Eisensteinian montage.

    The plots have never come across as a strong suit in Fred and Ginger's films, however when everything else is so good it doesn't present much of a problem. That is the case with The Gay Divorc&eacute;e and Fred and Ginger's other films too, if you want great escapism they provide that. In regard to Fred and Ginger's films, The Gay Divorc&eacute;e is one of their best, personal ranking would be third place behind Top Hat and Swing Time(with Top Hat getting the edge, Follow the Fleet and Shall We Dance are extremely good too). The story here is thin, but one of the more cohesive and wittiest stories in their films as well. The Gay Divorc&eacute;e, if not quite so much as Swing Time, is a beautiful-looking film, the sets are ingeniously delightful with the standout being the deco Brighton and the photography shows great technical skill and sensitivity. The score is lush and often romantic-sounding thanks to Max Steiner's very distinctive musicality and arranging. And the songs are just wonderful, Night and Day is timeless but as a whole scene, visually, choreographically and song-wise, while long The Continental was the highlight. The script has plenty of warmth, wit and heart, Erik Rhodes' line about Tornetti and spaghetti raises a big chuckle. The choreography merges so well with the music and looks so athletic and poised even now, and it's matched perfectly by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers', both giving endearing performances, dancing. The supporting cast are also spot on, Erik Rhodes like he did in Top Hat comes very close to stealing the show while Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore don't disappoint. Young Betty Grable really shines too in the number Let's K-nock K-nees. In conclusion, one of Fred and Ginger's best, a really exciting start to an iconic pairing which gave way to films that are equally as good. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to love in this lavish musical comedy loosely based upon Cole Porter's 1932 show, the only movie in which Fred Astaire got to repeat his Broadway role. Only one song ("Night and Day") remains, and he has a new leading lady (Ginger Rogers replacing Claire Luce), so for their second pairing and first leads, Fred and Ginger entered film immortality. There's plenty of silliness to be had, a few lavish production numbers, and yet all results in a romantic film that has gone on to movie immortality. The basic storyline has American attorney Fred Astaire chasing the girl (Rogers), not realizing that his partner (Edward Everett Horton) is the attorney in her divorce case. She's at first annoyed by them (he catches her in a precarious predicament), and he actually stalks her for a bit, but once they break the ice (with "Night and Day"), she begins to warm up to him. But when she mistakingly believes that he's the hired correspondent paid to help her get the divorce, more confusion ensues until the correct one (the hysterical Erik Rhodes) shows up with his concertina. Alice Brady has some of the funniest dumb lines in movie history, her malapropisms filled with innuendo. Droll Eric Blore adds more amusement as the hotel waiter with Betty Grable coming on for a delightful song and dance number ("Let's K-Nock K-Nees") with Horton. It's clear that there's a future star in this delightful peppy youngster, yet it took 6 years before she would find success in lavish color musicals over at 20th Century Fox. As for "The Continental", it is set up nicely, although I laughed more at the fact that Astaire had a pair of paper scissors on him and could take a page out of a magazine and make it stand up on a record player to provide a shadow for him and Rogers while they went out and danced without Rhodes' knowledge. The production number goes on forever, but is so delightful that it really doesn't matter, seeming more like a music video with its brunette dancers in black dresses and blonde dancers in white dresses.

    After causing a sensation in Flying Down to Rio with their dance sequence there, RKO decided to give Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers a whole movie to themselves the following year. This would eventually lead to a series of films starring them to mostly great box office results. As it was, this would be the first time that Astaire would pursue Ms. Rogers with the latter resisting at first before a mistaken identity plot also takes effect. The comedy involving them and supporting players like Alice Brady, Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, and Erik Rhodes was funny enough to me but it's really the songs and dances that really makes these movies enjoyable enough for repeat viewings. The "Night & Day" sequence, especially, really puts the Astaire-Rogers dance numbers in full force and the later one called "The Continental" provides some fun among other dancers not to mention a now-forgotten singer named Lilian Miles. Oh, and Betty Grable-who was 17 at the time-also does a fine number called "Let's K-nock K-nees" with Horton who seemed game enough. Really, all I'll say now is The Gay Divorc&eacute;e is well worth seeing for the emergence of the classic movie dance team of Astaire & Rogers! Trivia note: William Austin, who plays Ginger's husband she's trying to divorce, eventually played Alfred the butler in the Batman serials in the '40s. His look there would eventually inspire DC Comics to change their previous physical look for Alfred to one that's thin and has facial hair.

    Well, Fred and Ginger were really beautiful together. Try to imagine this: clean, very clean environments with some evocativeartificial horizons, here a seaside resort, lovers who are destined but fate dredges up all sorts of dreamlike illusion to keep apart, a plot that emphasizes both fate and multilayered worry about hidden selves, the illusion (the worry) conquered with persistent love and expressed with dance. And yet, what a striking thing that it doesn't work like noir, where fate and hidden selves play a similar function; the difference is that the viewer has too much control over the players and plot. Is this why it registers like magic? We trust that all is going to turn out well.. Like Fred's character, we persist with the story because we feel safe and happy that it will all turn up for the better. From this pov, mishap thrown up by the gods is not as in noir the cause of anxious hallucination, but small, glittering bubbles of fate. Of course it is all so sunny, because the protagonist is, and is unafraid to take chancesthis infectious radiance colors the world. Top Hat is much more intricate, because you have two characters doubled with several more layers, here just one. This is easier to digest, more fun.

Sandrich directs the first of his five Astaire-Rogers films, borrowing a few tricks from Busby Berkeley.

    I've got to say, it took me a while to work up the courage to borrow 'The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934)' from the university library. Fortunately, I balanced things out by also renting the steamy neo-noir 'Body Heat (1981)!' Needless to say, my ill-ease was not necessary. The 1930s was a carefree and innocent time for American cinema, and here I can assure the reader that the divorc&eacute;e indicated by the title is merely happy. The film (my ninth from Astaire and Rogers) was the pair's second collaboration, and the first in which they were the stars. The story, adapted from the musical play "Gay Divorce," pretty much forms the template for their next half-dozen outings, a throwaway love-story fraught with screwball misunderstandings and elaborate art deco hotel- rooms. Ginger Rogers requires a divorce from her neglectful husband, and so tries to fake a love-affair (as you do) with a pompous Italian called Tonetti (Erik Rhodes). Fred Astaire comes along, falls in love with Ginger, but she mistakes him for the guy with whom she's supposed to be faking a love-affair. 'The Gay Divorc&eacute;e' has an excellent cast. Fred Astaire, of course, exudes the same classiness and boyish charm that made him the stand-out in 'Flying Down to Rio (1933)' -- and just check out how gracefully he is able to dance and get dressed at the same time. Ginger Rogers, ever the gifted comedienne, shows wonderful composure, effortlessly making the conversion from apathy towards her male co-star to adoration. Edward Everett Horton, whose constant huffiness bounces amusingly off the carefree Astaire, is unfortunate enough to be given a dance number (opposite Betty Grable), through which he awkwardly and hilariously stumbles. Erik Rhodes, who was the highlight of 'Top Hat (1935),' again manages to steal the show, his pompous Italian "womaniser" a constant source of amusement. There's also Eric Blore, doing that butler thing he does best. Musical highlights include "Night and Day" and the Oscar- winning "Continental," which briefly abandons the long-takes you'd usually find in an Astaire film, instead lapsing into a rapid-fire Eisensteinian montage.

    The plots have never come across as a strong suit in Fred and Ginger's films, however when everything else is so good it doesn't present much of a problem. That is the case with The Gay Divorc&eacute;e and Fred and Ginger's other films too, if you want great escapism they provide that. In regard to Fred and Ginger's films, The Gay Divorc&eacute;e is one of their best, personal ranking would be third place behind Top Hat and Swing Time(with Top Hat getting the edge, Follow the Fleet and Shall We Dance are extremely good too). The story here is thin, but one of the more cohesive and wittiest stories in their films as well. The Gay Divorc&eacute;e, if not quite so much as Swing Time, is a beautiful-looking film, the sets are ingeniously delightful with the standout being the deco Brighton and the photography shows great technical skill and sensitivity. The score is lush and often romantic-sounding thanks to Max Steiner's very distinctive musicality and arranging. And the songs are just wonderful, Night and Day is timeless but as a whole scene, visually, choreographically and song-wise, while long The Continental was the highlight. The script has plenty of warmth, wit and heart, Erik Rhodes' line about Tornetti and spaghetti raises a big chuckle. The choreography merges so well with the music and looks so athletic and poised even now, and it's matched perfectly by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers', both giving endearing performances, dancing. The supporting cast are also spot on, Erik Rhodes like he did in Top Hat comes very close to stealing the show while Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore don't disappoint. Young Betty Grable really shines too in the number Let's K-nock K-nees. In conclusion, one of Fred and Ginger's best, a really exciting start to an iconic pairing which gave way to films that are equally as good. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    There's a lot to love in this lavish musical comedy loosely based upon Cole Porter's 1932 show, the only movie in which Fred Astaire got to repeat his Broadway role. Only one song ("Night and Day") remains, and he has a new leading lady (Ginger Rogers replacing Claire Luce), so for their second pairing and first leads, Fred and Ginger entered film immortality. There's plenty of silliness to be had, a few lavish production numbers, and yet all results in a romantic film that has gone on to movie immortality. The basic storyline has American attorney Fred Astaire chasing the girl (Rogers), not realizing that his partner (Edward Everett Horton) is the attorney in her divorce case. She's at first annoyed by them (he catches her in a precarious predicament), and he actually stalks her for a bit, but once they break the ice (with "Night and Day"), she begins to warm up to him. But when she mistakingly believes that he's the hired correspondent paid to help her get the divorce, more confusion ensues until the correct one (the hysterical Erik Rhodes) shows up with his concertina. Alice Brady has some of the funniest dumb lines in movie history, her malapropisms filled with innuendo. Droll Eric Blore adds more amusement as the hotel waiter with Betty Grable coming on for a delightful song and dance number ("Let's K-Nock K-Nees") with Horton. It's clear that there's a future star in this delightful peppy youngster, yet it took 6 years before she would find success in lavish color musicals over at 20th Century Fox. As for "The Continental", it is set up nicely, although I laughed more at the fact that Astaire had a pair of paper scissors on him and could take a page out of a magazine and make it stand up on a record player to provide a shadow for him and Rogers while they went out and danced without Rhodes' knowledge. The production number goes on forever, but is so delightful that it really doesn't matter, seeming more like a music video with its brunette dancers in black dresses and blonde dancers in white dresses.

    After causing a sensation in Flying Down to Rio with their dance sequence there, RKO decided to give Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers a whole movie to themselves the following year. This would eventually lead to a series of films starring them to mostly great box office results. As it was, this would be the first time that Astaire would pursue Ms. Rogers with the latter resisting at first before a mistaken identity plot also takes effect. The comedy involving them and supporting players like Alice Brady, Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, and Erik Rhodes was funny enough to me but it's really the songs and dances that really makes these movies enjoyable enough for repeat viewings. The "Night & Day" sequence, especially, really puts the Astaire-Rogers dance numbers in full force and the later one called "The Continental" provides some fun among other dancers not to mention a now-forgotten singer named Lilian Miles. Oh, and Betty Grable-who was 17 at the time-also does a fine number called "Let's K-nock K-nees" with Horton who seemed game enough. Really, all I'll say now is The Gay Divorc&eacute;e is well worth seeing for the emergence of the classic movie dance team of Astaire & Rogers! Trivia note: William Austin, who plays Ginger's husband she's trying to divorce, eventually played Alfred the butler in the Batman serials in the '40s. His look there would eventually inspire DC Comics to change their previous physical look for Alfred to one that's thin and has facial hair.

    Well, Fred and Ginger were really beautiful together. Try to imagine this: clean, very clean environments with some evocativeartificial horizons, here a seaside resort, lovers who are destined but fate dredges up all sorts of dreamlike illusion to keep apart, a plot that emphasizes both fate and multilayered worry about hidden selves, the illusion (the worry) conquered with persistent love and expressed with dance. And yet, what a striking thing that it doesn't work like noir, where fate and hidden selves play a similar function; the difference is that the viewer has too much control over the players and plot. Is this why it registers like magic? We trust that all is going to turn out well.. Like Fred's character, we persist with the story because we feel safe and happy that it will all turn up for the better. From this pov, mishap thrown up by the gods is not as in noir the cause of anxious hallucination, but small, glittering bubbles of fate. Of course it is all so sunny, because the protagonist is, and is unafraid to take chancesthis infectious radiance colors the world. Top Hat is much more intricate, because you have two characters doubled with several more layers, here just one. This is easier to digest, more fun.

    The movie musical had been a Hollywood staple since the dawn of the talkies, but after a few years the novelty of the all-singing picture was wearing off and the studios had to refresh the genre with new tricks and, most crucially, popular stars. Old hand Al Jolson had reinvented his image, Bing Crosby was a fresh-faced newcomer, but most successful of all was the duo of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This was their second appearance together, and the first where they were the lead players and main attraction. The two of them were rather different in background. Astaire had already been an established star on the stage and having worked with Ziegfeld was very much in touch with that passing generation of theatrical extravaganza, but he was a newcomer to cinema. Rogers on the other hand already had two-dozen movie credits to her name, and had gained a reputation in small roles, often as a catty, antagonistic chorine. But despite their differences they have in common an approach to dancing that, despite professional precision, brings out a lot of personality. And both can act. Ginger would later prove herself to be an excellent dramatic actress, and is steady enough here. Fred just has an easygoing charm that seems as effortless as his dancing. In a non-musical, these two would seem an odd pairing  it's when they dance we see them click. But these were early days yet, and in The Gay Divorc&eacute;e they lack that sense of familiarity around each other that would make their later romances seem so right. This was also the first time Astaire and Rogers were put before director Mark Sandrich, the man who helmed their most successful features together. Sandrich keeps a sort of gentle rhythm going throughout the picture with some delicate camera moves, such as the opening sweep through the restaurant onto Astaire's dancing fingers. His approach to the musical numbers was always oblique yet effective. For "Needle in a Haystack", the song is born out of a dialogue scene, with the camera still in its place, the sofa in the foreground separating us from Astaire, who (very unusually) is framed in profile. After one verse, the angle changes to place us in front of him. The camera then follows him as he gets up and selects a tie from a valet, and the dance just segues out of that movement. Sandrich's ability to make the songs flow seamlessly in and out of the non-music scenes was a key part in the ongoing revolution in how musicals were made. One thing that makes a musical like The Gay Divorc&eacute;e seem somewhat archaic is its plot. It's a comedy of errors that might have been quite good had it been fully developed as one, but the way the narrative twists to fit a song it becomes obviously artificial. It also suffers from an unpleasant quality of many romances of the era, in that the "romance" basically consists of the man stalking and harassing the woman until, against all probability, she falls for him (and not even the suave Mister Astaire can stop this from appearing creepy). The only thing that saves this from being a handful of noteworthy song-and-dance routines strung together with a limp story is the often witty dialogue and the way it is delivered by a wonderful supporting cast. Just as Fred and Ginger established their screen persona, so too did Edward Everett Horton become the fussy, mother-hen sidekick, Eric Blore the chirpy, intrusive butler and Erik Rhodes the bungling would-be Latin lover. These three are all excellent and, with the romantic interplay between Astaire and Rogers not quite as fizzing as it should be, dare I say they even overshadow the two leads? (Yes, I do dare say).

    After staying in Paris on vacation, the American dancer Guy Holden (Fred Astaire) and his Londoner lawyer friend Egbert Fitzgerald (Edward Everett Horton) return to London by ship. Guy meets the wealthy American blonde Mimi Glossop (Ginger Rogers), who is traveling with her aunt Hortense Ditherwell (Alice Brady), in the harbor and Mimi asks him to call her aunt to open her luggage since her dress is trapped in the trunk. Guy tries to release her dress but he accidentally rips Mimi's dress. Guy lends his overcoat to her expecting to receive it back with a thank-you note with her name and address, but Mimi returns the coat without any card. Meanwhile, Hortense seeks out Egbert, who is replacing his father in the office, expecting to get the divorce of Mimi and her husband, the geologist Cyril Glossop (William Austin). However, Cyril advises that it would be difficult to make Cyryl accepting the divorce and he suggest to Mimi to hire the "correspondent" Rodolfo Tonettito (Erik Rhodes) to stay with her in a hotel room. Meanwhile, Egbert would hire private eyes to arrive in Mimi's room and surprise the couple, forcing the divorce of Mimi and Cyril. Egbert gives a password to Tonettito to identify Mimi and uses a sentence created by Guy  "Chance Is the Fool's Name for Fate". Mimi believes that Guy is her correspondent and stays with him in her room. When Tonettito arrives in her room, the disappointed Mimi learns the truth and feels better. But she is still married and can not marry Guy. "The Gay Divorc&eacute;e" is a great classic musical, with Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire shining and dancing. The long song "The Continental" was awarded with the Oscar of Best Music in 1935 and it is delightful to see the choreography of the dance. In IMDb Trivia, there are interesting information about this film that I will not repeat in my review. In addiction, Ginger Rogers drives the mighty Duesenberg Model J, one of the most popular luxury cars as well as a status symbol in the United States and Europe. This car that cost between US$ 20,000.00 to US$ 25,000.00 in 1935 was driven by Clark Gable and Gary Cooper (the rare model SSJ 125), Al Capone, Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, Mae West, Tyrone Power among others personalities. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "A Alegre Divorciada" ("The Gay Divorc&eacute;e")

    I was really lucky to catch this film when it was being shown, I only missed the first two minutes, had I of known it was the first film starring the famous dancing star couple together I wouldn't have ignored it, thank goodness I spotted it, from director Amrk Sandrich (Top Hat, Shall We Dance). Basically in Brightbourne, Brighton, England arrives Mimi Glossop (Ginger Rogers) from America who seeks a divorce from her geologist husband Cyril (William Austin) who she hasn't seen for several years. Her domineering Aunt Hortense (Alice Brady), who has been married numerous times herself, is there to give her guidance and get bumbling and slightly incompetent lawyer Egbert 'Pinky' Fitzgerald (Edward Everett Horton) to consult them, he also happens to a former fianc&eacute;. He tries to get an adulterous relationship started as they spend a night in the hotel he found them, and professional co-respondent Rodolfo Tonetti (Erik Rhodes) is who he has hired to try and make it happen. He forgets though to hire private detectives to "catch them in the act", leaving Mimi free to do whatever she wants, and coincidently she again meets American dancer Guy Holden (Fred Astaire), they met briefly on her arrival. Guy is a friend of Egbert's and is now besotted with Mimi staying in the same hotel, and he is also mistaken as the co-respondent she is meant to be caught with. They are eventually caught by Tonetti who "holds them prisoner" as they wait to clear up the mess, and Cyril also arrives to speak his mind about the situation, but in the end Guy and Mimi escape to dance the night away and live happily ever after. Also starring Eric Blore as The Waiter, Lillian Miles as Singer, Continental Number, Charles Coleman as Guy's Valet and Betty Grable as Dance Specialty. Astaire is lovable and charming, Rogers is beautiful and innocent, and together their scenes are filled with fantastic chemistry, the film is has of course wonderful songs, with the Oscar winning "The Continental", "Night and Day", "Let's K-nock K-nees" and "A Needle In A Haystack", the dialogue is witty and funny which creates most of the best jokes, overall a delightful musical comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Music for Max Steiner, Best Sound and Best Picture. Fred Astaire was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Ginger Rogers was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women. Very good!

    Ginger's aunt concocts a scheme to get her out of her unhappy marriage, but complications arise. This film became the template for all the Astaire-Rogers films to follow - a silly plot involving mistaken identities, snappy musical numbers, and supporting cast featuring some combination of scene stealers Horton, Blore, and Rhodes. The formula would be perfected the following year with "Top Hat," but this is entertaining enough in its own right. The big musical number is "The Continental," which is enjoyable despite going on for more than 17 minutes. Sandrich directs the first of his five Astaire-Rogers films, borrowing a few tricks from Busby Berkeley.

    The movie musical had been a Hollywood staple since the dawn of the talkies, but after a few years the novelty of the all-singing picture was wearing off and the studios had to refresh the genre with new tricks and, most crucially, popular stars. Old hand Al Jolson had reinvented his image, Bing Crosby was a fresh-faced newcomer, but most successful of all was the duo of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This was their second appearance together, and the first where they were the lead players and main attraction. The two of them were rather different in background. Astaire had already been an established star on the stage and having worked with Ziegfeld was very much in touch with that passing generation of theatrical extravaganza, but he was a newcomer to cinema. Rogers on the other hand already had two-dozen movie credits to her name, and had gained a reputation in small roles, often as a catty, antagonistic chorine. But despite their differences they have in common an approach to dancing that, despite professional precision, brings out a lot of personality. And both can act. Ginger would later prove herself to be an excellent dramatic actress, and is steady enough here. Fred just has an easygoing charm that seems as effortless as his dancing. In a non-musical, these two would seem an odd pairing  it's when they dance we see them click. But these were early days yet, and in The Gay Divorc&eacute;e they lack that sense of familiarity around each other that would make their later romances seem so right. This was also the first time Astaire and Rogers were put before director Mark Sandrich, the man who helmed their most successful features together. Sandrich keeps a sort of gentle rhythm going throughout the picture with some delicate camera moves, such as the opening sweep through the restaurant onto Astaire's dancing fingers. His approach to the musical numbers was always oblique yet effective. For "Needle in a Haystack", the song is born out of a dialogue scene, with the camera still in its place, the sofa in the foreground separating us from Astaire, who (very unusually) is framed in profile. After one verse, the angle changes to place us in front of him. The camera then follows him as he gets up and selects a tie from a valet, and the dance just segues out of that movement. Sandrich's ability to make the songs flow seamlessly in and out of the non-music scenes was a key part in the ongoing revolution in how musicals were made. One thing that makes a musical like The Gay Divorc&eacute;e seem somewhat archaic is its plot. It's a comedy of errors that might have been quite good had it been fully developed as one, but the way the narrative twists to fit a song it becomes obviously artificial. It also suffers from an unpleasant quality of many romances of the era, in that the "romance" basically consists of the man stalking and harassing the woman until, against all probability, she falls for him (and not even the suave Mister Astaire can stop this from appearing creepy). The only thing that saves this from being a handful of noteworthy song-and-dance routines strung together with a limp story is the often witty dialogue and the way it is delivered by a wonderful supporting cast. Just as Fred and Ginger established their screen persona, so too did Edward Everett Horton become the fussy, mother-hen sidekick, Eric Blore the chirpy, intrusive butler and Erik Rhodes the bungling would-be Latin lover. These three are all excellent and, with the romantic interplay between Astaire and Rogers not quite as fizzing as it should be, dare I say they even overshadow the two leads? (Yes, I do dare say).

    After staying in Paris on vacation, the American dancer Guy Holden (Fred Astaire) and his Londoner lawyer friend Egbert Fitzgerald (Edward Everett Horton) return to London by ship. Guy meets the wealthy American blonde Mimi Glossop (Ginger Rogers), who is traveling with her aunt Hortense Ditherwell (Alice Brady), in the harbor and Mimi asks him to call her aunt to open her luggage since her dress is trapped in the trunk. Guy tries to release her dress but he accidentally rips Mimi's dress. Guy lends his overcoat to her expecting to receive it back with a thank-you note with her name and address, but Mimi returns the coat without any card. Meanwhile, Hortense seeks out Egbert, who is replacing his father in the office, expecting to get the divorce of Mimi and her husband, the geologist Cyril Glossop (William Austin). However, Cyril advises that it would be difficult to make Cyryl accepting the divorce and he suggest to Mimi to hire the "correspondent" Rodolfo Tonettito (Erik Rhodes) to stay with her in a hotel room. Meanwhile, Egbert would hire private eyes to arrive in Mimi's room and surprise the couple, forcing the divorce of Mimi and Cyril. Egbert gives a password to Tonettito to identify Mimi and uses a sentence created by Guy  "Chance Is the Fool's Name for Fate". Mimi believes that Guy is her correspondent and stays with him in her room. When Tonettito arrives in her room, the disappointed Mimi learns the truth and feels better. But she is still married and can not marry Guy. "The Gay Divorc&eacute;e" is a great classic musical, with Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire shining and dancing. The long song "The Continental" was awarded with the Oscar of Best Music in 1935 and it is delightful to see the choreography of the dance. In IMDb Trivia, there are interesting information about this film that I will not repeat in my review. In addiction, Ginger Rogers drives the mighty Duesenberg Model J, one of the most popular luxury cars as well as a status symbol in the United States and Europe. This car that cost between US$ 20,000.00 to US$ 25,000.00 in 1935 was driven by Clark Gable and Gary Cooper (the rare model SSJ 125), Al Capone, Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, Mae West, Tyrone Power among others personalities. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "A Alegre Divorciada" ("The Gay Divorc&eacute;e")

    I was really lucky to catch this film when it was being shown, I only missed the first two minutes, had I of known it was the first film starring the famous dancing star couple together I wouldn't have ignored it, thank goodness I spotted it, from director Amrk Sandrich (Top Hat, Shall We Dance). Basically in Brightbourne, Brighton, England arrives Mimi Glossop (Ginger Rogers) from America who seeks a divorce from her geologist husband Cyril (William Austin) who she hasn't seen for several years. Her domineering Aunt Hortense (Alice Brady), who has been married numerous times herself, is there to give her guidance and get bumbling and slightly incompetent lawyer Egbert 'Pinky' Fitzgerald (Edward Everett Horton) to consult them, he also happens to a former fianc&eacute;. He tries to get an adulterous relationship started as they spend a night in the hotel he found them, and professional co-respondent Rodolfo Tonetti (Erik Rhodes) is who he has hired to try and make it happen. He forgets though to hire private detectives to "catch them in the act", leaving Mimi free to do whatever she wants, and coincidently she again meets American dancer Guy Holden (Fred Astaire), they met briefly on her arrival. Guy is a friend of Egbert's and is now besotted with Mimi staying in the same hotel, and he is also mistaken as the co-respondent she is meant to be caught with. They are eventually caught by Tonetti who "holds them prisoner" as they wait to clear up the mess, and Cyril also arrives to speak his mind about the situation, but in the end Guy and Mimi escape to dance the night away and live happily ever after. Also starring Eric Blore as The Waiter, Lillian Miles as Singer, Continental Number, Charles Coleman as Guy's Valet and Betty Grable as Dance Specialty. Astaire is lovable and charming, Rogers is beautiful and innocent, and together their scenes are filled with fantastic chemistry, the film is has of course wonderful songs, with the Oscar winning "The Continental", "Night and Day", "Let's K-nock K-nees" and "A Needle In A Haystack", the dialogue is witty and funny which creates most of the best jokes, overall a delightful musical comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Music for Max Steiner, Best Sound and Best Picture. Fred Astaire was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Ginger Rogers was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women. Very good!

    Ginger's aunt concocts a scheme to get her out of her unhappy marriage, but complications arise. This film became the template for all the Astaire-Rogers films to follow - a silly plot involving mistaken identities, snappy musical numbers, and supporting cast featuring some combination of scene stealers Horton, Blore, and Rhodes. The formula would be perfected the following year with "Top Hat," but this is entertaining enough in its own right. The big musical number is "The Continental," which is enjoyable despite going on for more than 17 minutes. Sandrich directs the first of his five Astaire-Rogers films, borrowing a few tricks from Busby Berkeley.

    I've got to say, it took me a while to work up the courage to borrow 'The Gay Divorc&eacute;e (1934)' from the university library. Fortunately, I balanced things out by also renting the steamy neo-noir 'Body Heat (1981)!' Needless to say, my ill-ease was not necessary. The 1930s was a carefree and innocent time for American cinema, and here I can assure the reader that the divorc&eacute;e indicated by the title is merely happy. The film (my ninth from Astaire and Rogers) was the pair's second collaboration, and the first in which they were the stars. The story, adapted from the musical play "Gay Divorce," pretty much forms the template for their next half-dozen outings, a throwaway love-story fraught with screwball misunderstandings and elaborate art deco hotel- rooms. Ginger Rogers requires a divorce from her neglectful husband, and so tries to fake a love-affair (as you do) with a pompous Italian called Tonetti (Erik Rhodes). Fred Astaire comes along, falls in love with Ginger, but she mistakes him for the guy with whom she's supposed to be faking a love-affair. 'The Gay Divorc&eacute;e' has an excellent cast. Fred Astaire, of course, exudes the same classiness and boyish charm that made him the stand-out in 'Flying Down to Rio (1933)' -- and just check out how gracefully he is able to dance and get dressed at the same time. Ginger Rogers, ever the gifted comedienne, shows wonderful composure, effortlessly making the conversion from apathy towards her male co-star to adoration. Edward Everett Horton, whose constant huffiness bounces amusingly off the carefree Astaire, is unfortunate enough to be given a dance number (opposite Betty Grable), through which he awkwardly and hilariously stumbles. Erik Rhodes, who was the highlight of 'Top Hat (1935),' again manages to steal the show, his pompous Italian "womaniser" a constant source of amusement. There's also Eric Blore, doing that butler thing he does best. Musical highlights include "Night and Day" and the Oscar- winning "Continental," which briefly abandons the long-takes you'd usually find in an Astaire film, instead lapsing into a rapid-fire Eisensteinian montage.
