    This was the first time that I have seen Audie England, not being a fan of Red Shoe Diaries. I believe it is also the first Zalman King directed film I have seen. I was just mesmerized by England. She had a look that made me immediately search for more of her work, and I will be watching Free Enterprise and Miami Hustle very soon to see her again. She is an incredible beauty and this film is worth the time just to see her. It's not worth much more that that. I've seen the brilliant Henry and June, and it did the bohemian lifestyle in Paris in the 30s and 40s much better. This film was loosely based on Ana&iuml;s Nin's work also. Looking forward to seeing her in a better film.

    When I saw this movie for the first time, I was surprised. It's different with other cheap semi porn movies. Even compare with Penthouse or Playboy home video or Wild Orchid. Delta of Venus has more deep story and erotic. But I still like 9 1/2 weeks the best. Anyway this movie had good cinematography. Nice song from Zete and beautiful score. I gave 7 out of 10 cause above reason. I like the scene, when Elena make love at the kitchen. Very sensual and hot. Zalma King at least has made 3 good movies 9 1/2 weeks, wild orchid and the last delta of Venus. This recommended as for stimulation your partner couple..

    Anais Nin's infamous book is brought to the screen by King, the man who put the "soft" in soft-porn. It is full of attractive actors and beautiful cinematography, much like a shampoo commercial. The leads (England and Mandylor) try hard to convey the smoldering lust that lies behind their supposedly passionate but rather vacuous stares but then they open their mouths and utter either sweet nothings or something unbelievably pretentious and it just ruins everything. There is a fair amount of nudity and simulated sex (although the NC-17 rating is puzzling) but the frenetic editing destroys the mood just as things start to get interesting. Read the book instead.

    Some of the plot elements of this film were vaguely familiar to me, and I don't know if it is from reading "Delta of Venus" lo, those many years ago, or maybe from "Henry and June" the film about Nin and Henry Miller, from 10 years ago or so. Anyway, this is an exceptional film for its genre, with good acting, direction, and pretty decent other assorted production values. I had never seen or heard of Audie England, and her beauty just floored me. Wow! Anyway, if you can at all tolerate soft-core erotica, this film is recommended. Grade: B+

    I don't think you can pack more into a hour and a half movie, without it exploding. This film has politics, romance, sexual awakening, war, art, anti-semitism and lots of sexy gorgeous nude woman (especially, if you like red heads) in a wonderfully photographed "epic". The only thing wrong was that Audie England should have kept her mouth shut. Her face and body are sheer cinematic poetry, but she just did not seem to be able to say any words with any conviction. If you prefer your sex during the rise of fascism in a romance country, this film is a must have! Of course, you must see the un-rated version. The sex does really contribute to the plot. P.S. Don't waste your time on Titanic! This movie is light-years ahead of it.

    I rented the movie before reading the comments and would have done so anyway just to catch the soft porn that was promised. Was it worth seeing the whole thing for the eroticism? NO. What a waste of my time and the film crews's. What a waste of video tape.

    Pretentious, badly written, badly acted drivel, this film is worth seeing only for its erotic content, especially the scenes involving the gorgeous Audie England and the erotic Marketa Hrubesova. Come to think of it, save your time and money and watch the "Red Shoe Diaries" on cable. You might get to see Audi, too.

    Okay, folks, let's take a test. what do you expect when you rent a movie with the name "Zalman King" on the box? Anywhere on the box? You expect soft-core porn with pretentions of greatness and lensed in a slow-moving style, color-saturated, and all with Playboy-flair. This one delivers. Not only is it packed with wall to wall sex, but the lead actress, Audie England, is a good actress in serious need of better material. The setting is inspired and if you go in not expecting too much, you'll get your fill.

    It looks like a 90 minute perfume ad. Since I produce commercials for a living I know one when I see one. Stylish if not a little sleepish. Intense at times and nonsense most of the times. If you like 9 1/2 weeks, Wild Orchid and the like then you will love this one (all of these movies are pretty much the same story line, dialog etc...) other wise watch "The Tango Lesson" also set in Paris the real Paris not Prague dressed up as in this movie. The Tango Lesson is more insightful intelligent just as stylish and what this movie could have been. I still like this movie it gives me ideas for my next commercial project.

    "Delta of Venus", director Zalman King's erotic adaptation of praised writer Anais Nin's book, is a lush, sexy, dramatic film. It's 1940 Paris and young aspiring writer Elena Martin begins a hot affair with smut author Lawrence. One night Elena catches Lawrence in the arms of another and leaves him, then she supports herself as a nude model and begins writing erotica for a wealthy male patron. But she can't write about it until she experiences it first. I highly recommend both the book "Delta of Venus" and the movie version as well. "Delta of Venus" is UNRATED for strong sexual sequences, graphic nudity, and for some language. NOTE: "Delta of Venus" is available in a slightly cut R Rated version that omits one minute of sexual footage, and an UNRATED version that restores the cut minute.
