    If you are heavily offended by the F or C word, or it's even taboo, forget about watching this film. Nil By Mouth is reality unfolding, before our very eyes. Ray Winstone gives a ferocious performance as a drug dealer ex parolee, also a heavy boozer, who likes to down a beer after a wine. Unfortunately his boozing leads to his habitual wife bashing. This time around it had devastating consequences. His long suffering wife, (Kathy Burke in a standout performance) has a heroin addict for brother, also an ex parolee (Charlie Creed Miles, who adds another A grade performance to this film). He's totally believable, especially in his desperation for another fix, mostly in scenes where he's having heated arguments with his mother (Oldman's real life sister). The montage song for this, I loved by the way. Nil by Mouth is not a plot driven movie. It's real life, and a kind of situation movie too. It's a movie based on Oldman's background, as a kid, growing up. Ray Winstone, who's got his career back on track after this 1998 film, has become one of my favorite actors. I'm glad he did too, as cinema has missed a movie great for far too long. The first half an hour has Winstone, and his best mate (Jamie Foreman) spinning gags and telling stories that you become involved with, one especially involving one of their mad crim mates. Even later on, after Winstone has gone berserk, tearing up his place, as if a buffalo charged through it, we have a scene with him spilling his sad childhood, about fatherly neglect onto his mate (Jamie Foreman), a patient and supportive listener, as shown in some other scenes as well, the kind of mate, everyone should have. The constant use of expletives, and I use constant with a capital C was true to fact from Oldman's perspective from what I heard. I've never heard a higher use of curses in film. At times the constant expletives become too much, but they're in those intense explosive scenes, Winstone's ones that work for it so darn well. E.g. like where he's trying to get his daughter back, causing a ruckus with other neighbors. You could see this happening anywhere. In life, we have our bad times and good times, one good time, clearly reflected in the last scene where everything's back on an evening keel, and Winstone's re-united with wife and daughter. It's cute, this scene with him, snuggling his daughter. These are moments you cherish and hold onto. It's one of the movie's best scenes. Another one is him, play fighting with his wife's mother, a tough steadfast oldie, who puts up her dukes. She doesn't have a bad singing voice to match, either, we discover. The other scene that's particularly impressive, is Winstone alone, liquored up, calling the wife. When he hangs up, he resumes a conversation, picking up his handset phone again, and banging it many times against it's receiver, while delivering an apologetic conversation, as if his wife (who's bashed face looks like a steamroller went over it) is there. This is followed by him defending himself, blaming the wife. This guy has really been torn in some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. We actually can't help feeling sorry for the guy, in spite of the consequences, prior to his violent acts, one murderous, which is most unforgiving. Winstone is one of those actors, like Ray Liotta, who can play rage and anger with brilliant believability, and also be threatening. Winstone's character is someone you wouldn't want get on their bad side, or meet in a dark alley. But it's Burke as the abused wife that rises above the other performances. That Kevin and Perry crap doesn't do her justice. The most effective NBM moment is near the start, during one of those stories, where Burke in the background, literally shakes for a couple of seconds while rigidly holding a coffee, as if the F words have become all too much, and too, this abuse has been going on for much too long. The bashing scene, where we see Ray's proud shirtless body, as he pounds on his wifee, who by the way is pregnant, will disturb some I imagine as it kind of did me, as he shouts the C word in a succession. One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia: Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand. Excellent, and in one sense, a sheer masterpiece, that MUST be viewed.

    'Nil By Mouth' is a potent, relentless dose of real life; a portrait of the dead-end cycle of violence, abuse, addiction and poverty that occurs in cities all over the world. Though a trifle convoluted (there are a few scenes that contribute little or nothing to the film), it is a genuinely moving, visceral experience. Don't be mistaken, this is not another trashy British gangster flick, far from it. Ray Winstone(Ray) and Kathy Burke (Valerie) are both tremendous, their performances stop the film from descending into the realm of 'The Football Factory' or 'Rise of the Footsoldier'. It's also the script that distinguishes it from such films which, on face value, appear comparable. The script has ample profanity, and I really mean ample, it's the most profane film I've ever seen, but it also has segments of real poignancy. Burke and Winstone interpreted the script perfectly. Winstone's performance is unsettlingly convincing; some may say he's one-dimensional, but he really is a rather good actor. It is Kathy Burke's moments that are the most moving, chiefly a scene where she desperately tells a white-lie: it's genuinely upsetting. The film is rightfully spared of romanticism, it's completely devoid of poetic licence, what you see is pure, candid realism. Ironically, the film isn't pure at all, it's gritty and unrestrained in its depiction of violence and vulgarity; one moment being particularly horrifying. To criticise the film for being 'unfocused' is missing the point. To me, it was an almost non- linear insight into the human condition, a film woven from the personal experiences of Gary Oldman and delivered with the utmost conviction from Burke, Winstone and indeed the whole cast.

    Nil By Mouth is not a film made for enjoyment - or even entertainment, for that matter. This is a raw, gritty insight into the very real world of alcoholism, abusive relationships, and general dysfunction. In his directorial debut, Gary Oldman makes no attempt to sugarcoat his perception of life in South London. Utilizing rough dialogue, claustrophobic camera work, grim lighting, and a constant presence of violent tension, he has instead created a cathartic and uncomfortably honest atmosphere from start to finish. The entire cast is pitch-perfect for what this film is trying to achieve- that being to divert from the typical Hollywood 'art imitating life' and into the real, unglamorous, and painful lives that thousands of people world-wide have to face every day. They are not in this film for their looks or reputation, but rather for their ability to capture what it is to be human in broken circumstances. They don't make practiced faces into the camera. They don't spew out Oscar-ready monologues. They don't shed the single, pretty tear down the cheek. No. They forget about the camera's presence and do exactly what you and I would do in their given situations, making them better actors than most A-Listers that you'll see today. Nil By Mouth is a thoroughly unpleasant 2 hour watch, and it will certainly be difficult to sit through. Never-the-less, it is a film that needs to be watched. While film is a great medium for escaping our daily hardships, it can also be used as a means of opening our eyes to the crueler side of life - the life of our neighbours, our friends, or even ourselves. Oldman has achieved this without mercy or restraint, and as a result has created a masterful study of every-day horrors.

    Gary Oldman's, Nil by Mouth (1997) is a gritty, dark, bleak and powerful movie with constant extremely strong language and unprecedented realism. The Movie nails 522 F-words (The most from any official motion picture film) The documentary on the F-word isn't classed as an official movie. And has more C-words than any other film with at least 82 (Maybe up to a hundred) So I strongly suggest AVOIDING this if you can't stand bad language and all emotional viewers should steer clear as the film can be tough to watch at times. The positives are huge though,which is why I rated this film (My 1st official IMDb Review) as a whopping 10/10. The acting is so believable and convincing. It makes you feel like you are watching a documentary somehow with that amazing realism in the atmosphere. It's so gripping to watch and will leave you in shock after watching thinking WOW! What a film. It has that impact. The film received 2 Bafta's and deserves It's awards because It's a corker. Gary Oldman: Excellent actor, writer & director. Ray Winstone's best performance (IMO) in any film by a long shot. And Kathy Burke was exceptional along with him. A real gem masterpiece. Take my word for it and watch it!

    It's always a fun experience to watch an actors shift to the director chair. Such is the story behind Nil by Mouth, the directorial debut of Gary Oldman, one of the finest actors working today. Oldman himself does not appear in the film, but a whole collection of fantastic actors do instead. The film is a brutal story of a dysfunctional family living in London. This distraught and detached family struggles to stay together, having to battle one brothers heroin addiction, anothers short temper and violent tendencies, as well as the general debauchery that occurs within the lives of these people. This isn't a pleasant film and it isn't a happy film. It's a brutal depiction of London working-class districts and it will certainly disturb you to your core. The brutality of Nil by Mouth is unheard of. The film is a non-stop stream of cursing, graphic drug uses, and despicable violence. The film never lets up on the atrocity, leaving you no time to catch your breath. It's a fast moving film; one that doesn't stop to explain things and doesn't spell everything out for you. It's a completely character driven story with more character development in it than actual events occurring. Yet, enough happens to make the film plenty interesting. It slows down towards the middle as it sets up for its somber ending that leaves you with a strange and uneasy feeling in your stomach. Now, I'm always up for a great character driven story, but you have to be prepared for a lot going into Nil by Mouth. The thing is, the characters in this film are not likable in the least. They are the most despicable, deplorable, horridly atrocious people you've ever laid eyes on. Apart from them being sleazy and unattractive, they all possess the most unflattering personalities. The film presents a very strange family dynamic, having the characters constantly switch between love and hate for one another. Billy, the brother with the terrible heroin addiction, has his own mother give him drug money and also provides him with a place to shoot up. This seems like the most brutal form of motherly love until the two scream at each other a scene later, throwing the most horrendous profanities at one another. It is indeed some of the strangest relationships you could ever observe, teetering on being farcical at times, yet being sincerely compelling at other times. Overall, it is hard to become attached to the characters in Nil by Mouth. They certainly tell a fascinatingly twisted story, but don't expect to find any sympathy left in your heart when it's all over. This film disturbs me more than entertains me, but that is obviously the point. It is so harrowing and so horrendous that I can't guarantee you will want to watch it again once it's over. I'm not sure that I do, but I don't regret watching it by any means. Gary Oldman needs to try his luck with directing again one of these days, because his first attempt has gone pretty well.

    Its very rare that I rate something 10 out of 10 but Nil By Mouth deserves it. What really really nags me is that this excellent film is poorly rated by Americans and Canadians etc that just don't get the lingo etc. Or the fact that Nil By Mouth is 'too grim' to applaud. I mean, had this been some less violent American movie by some A list actors then they would of gotten Oscar nominations and all sorts. The fact is this film is too real for most people. It has a lot of heart and reality to it. Its so gritty and raw and exploding with substance I cant believe how much Nil By Mouth is overlooked. AS far as I'm concerned this is the British Once Were Warriors, another great film but from New Zealand. I praise Gary Oldman for making such an honest, from the heart film. It is so rare nowadays to see something like Nil By Mouth. Kathy Burke is fantastic as the abused wife, and Ray Winstone equally as fantastic as the abuser and raging alcoholic. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. I really wish films like this existed today, sadly no one has the balls, vision or creativeness. Top film. If you think this film has no artistic merit then you really haven't got a clue. Its unique.

    ...and when I say reality,I mean just that. A universal reality. I've only been to London once for a concert and I stayed there for 3 days, so I'm not at all qualified to say that this is a slice of proletarian London life, and yet I felt the unequivocal and bland smell of real life right from the first frame.And that's because Gary Oldman manages to capture the universal drama of human life and emotion.He manages that through some really uninteresting dialog, some ordinary issues (poverty,macho-British style,hopelessness,addiction,abuse) and almost no cinematic thrills or gimmicks. The problem is that we are so used to those cinematic artifices that a movie like this one comes across as a flat line on a hospital machine. Not even when we have a climatic scene of Ray savagely beating his wife, I didn't feel terrified or like turning away in disgust because the by then the movie painstakingly tells the viewer that that's how it is and there is nothing to do about it, in other words, you're already emotionally numb and somehow not involved. Oldman considers this a semi-autobiographical movie. Add to that the way it is presented to us and it sheds some light as to why he's such a gifted, unconventional and unique actor, he clearly takes his energy, feelings and life experience from some unusual places. Absolutely shattering stuff.

    English actor Gary Oldman sunk $1.5 million of his own money into NIL BY MOUTH, a film he wrote and directed. It is an noncommercial film set in and around the London of his youth - a South London council estate where the sun never shines (these films always work best when shot in winter) and everything has a grey, washed out look to it. There's no real plot in NIL BY MOUTH. It focuses on villain Ray (Ray Winstone), his wife (Kathy Burke) and her brother (Charlie Creed Mills). The film often seems to consist of long scenes of people boozing, swearing and shooting up heroin. Much of the dialogue consists of the 'F' word used over and over again. Oldman does have an acute ear for discomforting dialogue (one character says of a woman he saw "getting a severe portion right up the f**king Gary") - it never sounds scripted and the whole film seems to happening spontaneously in front of the camera. Winstone delivers a career-best performance as the drunk Ray and Kathy Burke (who won the Best Actress prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for this role) wears an expression of down-trodden weariness on her face in every scene. When Ray beats her up in a drunken rage (she is pregnant at the time), it's a wince inducing scene complete with moans of pain from Burke. It's an astonishing moment that stays with you days, months, even years after you witness it. This is the underclass at its rawest and filmmaking at its rawest. It's grimness and imagery burns into your mind and once seen you'll find it difficult to shake or forget, a distinction it shares with Alan Clarke's SCUM - and Clarke was one of Oldman's stated influences when shooting the movie.

    I'm a sucker for Cockney films. I've got a few Cockney mates & I'm fascinated by their accent, slang & wit, but this is not Lock, Stock & Two Smoking, mate. Not even close. I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog. (English subtitles would have come in handy here.) But the very realism that makes this film so brilliant is what makes it so excruciating to watch. First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke. Nil by Mouth is about family  & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand  in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone  is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time. Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly  clearly still in a lot of pain  but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance. Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy  you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that  but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is. And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep. The ending is left open to interpretation. This isn't Hollywood; there never was a plot, nothing's neatly resolved, no comforting closure here. Is this a temporary truce or is it worse, a genuine rapprochement? It's impossible for the viewer to forgive Ray his brutality, and yet you're left with the sinking feeling that Val will & the cycle will go on.

    This is Gary Oldman's only directorial role. He is known for playing villains and difficult characters in a range of movies, and is known for having taken many "integrity roles" - not pandering to Hollywood-style movie star roles. His work as an actor is outstanding and suggests he loves theatre and film, and thinks seriously about the roles he accepts. So, his directorial debut should be judged by a high standard. Fortunately, it surpasses expectations. This is movie about working class London life. It is gritty, it is dark, it is heavy. It doesn't try to build up an idea of London Gangster, as other movies of this ilk seem prone to doing. There is no sense that the movie is an attempt to posture or create a "British ghetto cool" in response to American Gangster or Ghetto movies. It is unflinching in it's portrayal of housing estate life, heroin addiction, and families flawed on many levels. It doesn't romanticise any of this. But, despite the dark mood of the piece, and the coarseness of the characters involved, you do get a feeling that this family love each other and care about each other. Sometimes, this causes tension - as a viewer, you can't help feeling life might be better for each member of this family if they just went their separate ways. But, true to life, they stick together, in the face of continual betrayals, violence, angers, and destruction. And they keep a dark sense of humour throughout. As someone who has experienced the environment portrayed int his film, I found it highly realistic. The humour was twisted, but genuinely so - in times of such strife, gallows humour comes to the surface. And the continuing sense that the next crisis is only a lift ride away makes this movie forceful and unforgiving in it's portrayal of British street life.

He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia: Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand. Excellent, and in one sense, a sheer masterpiece, that MUST be viewed.

    'Nil By Mouth' is a potent, relentless dose of real life; a portrait of the dead-end cycle of violence, abuse, addiction and poverty that occurs in cities all over the world. Though a trifle convoluted (there are a few scenes that contribute little or nothing to the film), it is a genuinely moving, visceral experience. Don't be mistaken, this is not another trashy British gangster flick, far from it. Ray Winstone(Ray) and Kathy Burke (Valerie) are both tremendous, their performances stop the film from descending into the realm of 'The Football Factory' or 'Rise of the Footsoldier'. It's also the script that distinguishes it from such films which, on face value, appear comparable. The script has ample profanity, and I really mean ample, it's the most profane film I've ever seen, but it also has segments of real poignancy. Burke and Winstone interpreted the script perfectly. Winstone's performance is unsettlingly convincing; some may say he's one-dimensional, but he really is a rather good actor. It is Kathy Burke's moments that are the most moving, chiefly a scene where she desperately tells a white-lie: it's genuinely upsetting. The film is rightfully spared of romanticism, it's completely devoid of poetic licence, what you see is pure, candid realism. Ironically, the film isn't pure at all, it's gritty and unrestrained in its depiction of violence and vulgarity; one moment being particularly horrifying. To criticise the film for being 'unfocused' is missing the point. To me, it was an almost non- linear insight into the human condition, a film woven from the personal experiences of Gary Oldman and delivered with the utmost conviction from Burke, Winstone and indeed the whole cast.

    Nil By Mouth is not a film made for enjoyment - or even entertainment, for that matter. This is a raw, gritty insight into the very real world of alcoholism, abusive relationships, and general dysfunction. In his directorial debut, Gary Oldman makes no attempt to sugarcoat his perception of life in South London. Utilizing rough dialogue, claustrophobic camera work, grim lighting, and a constant presence of violent tension, he has instead created a cathartic and uncomfortably honest atmosphere from start to finish. The entire cast is pitch-perfect for what this film is trying to achieve- that being to divert from the typical Hollywood 'art imitating life' and into the real, unglamorous, and painful lives that thousands of people world-wide have to face every day. They are not in this film for their looks or reputation, but rather for their ability to capture what it is to be human in broken circumstances. They don't make practiced faces into the camera. They don't spew out Oscar-ready monologues. They don't shed the single, pretty tear down the cheek. No. They forget about the camera's presence and do exactly what you and I would do in their given situations, making them better actors than most A-Listers that you'll see today. Nil By Mouth is a thoroughly unpleasant 2 hour watch, and it will certainly be difficult to sit through. Never-the-less, it is a film that needs to be watched. While film is a great medium for escaping our daily hardships, it can also be used as a means of opening our eyes to the crueler side of life - the life of our neighbours, our friends, or even ourselves. Oldman has achieved this without mercy or restraint, and as a result has created a masterful study of every-day horrors.

    Gary Oldman's, Nil by Mouth (1997) is a gritty, dark, bleak and powerful movie with constant extremely strong language and unprecedented realism. The Movie nails 522 F-words (The most from any official motion picture film) The documentary on the F-word isn't classed as an official movie. And has more C-words than any other film with at least 82 (Maybe up to a hundred) So I strongly suggest AVOIDING this if you can't stand bad language and all emotional viewers should steer clear as the film can be tough to watch at times. The positives are huge though,which is why I rated this film (My 1st official IMDb Review) as a whopping 10/10. The acting is so believable and convincing. It makes you feel like you are watching a documentary somehow with that amazing realism in the atmosphere. It's so gripping to watch and will leave you in shock after watching thinking WOW! What a film. It has that impact. The film received 2 Bafta's and deserves It's awards because It's a corker. Gary Oldman: Excellent actor, writer & director. Ray Winstone's best performance (IMO) in any film by a long shot. And Kathy Burke was exceptional along with him. A real gem masterpiece. Take my word for it and watch it!

    It's always a fun experience to watch an actors shift to the director chair. Such is the story behind Nil by Mouth, the directorial debut of Gary Oldman, one of the finest actors working today. Oldman himself does not appear in the film, but a whole collection of fantastic actors do instead. The film is a brutal story of a dysfunctional family living in London. This distraught and detached family struggles to stay together, having to battle one brothers heroin addiction, anothers short temper and violent tendencies, as well as the general debauchery that occurs within the lives of these people. This isn't a pleasant film and it isn't a happy film. It's a brutal depiction of London working-class districts and it will certainly disturb you to your core. The brutality of Nil by Mouth is unheard of. The film is a non-stop stream of cursing, graphic drug uses, and despicable violence. The film never lets up on the atrocity, leaving you no time to catch your breath. It's a fast moving film; one that doesn't stop to explain things and doesn't spell everything out for you. It's a completely character driven story with more character development in it than actual events occurring. Yet, enough happens to make the film plenty interesting. It slows down towards the middle as it sets up for its somber ending that leaves you with a strange and uneasy feeling in your stomach. Now, I'm always up for a great character driven story, but you have to be prepared for a lot going into Nil by Mouth. The thing is, the characters in this film are not likable in the least. They are the most despicable, deplorable, horridly atrocious people you've ever laid eyes on. Apart from them being sleazy and unattractive, they all possess the most unflattering personalities. The film presents a very strange family dynamic, having the characters constantly switch between love and hate for one another. Billy, the brother with the terrible heroin addiction, has his own mother give him drug money and also provides him with a place to shoot up. This seems like the most brutal form of motherly love until the two scream at each other a scene later, throwing the most horrendous profanities at one another. It is indeed some of the strangest relationships you could ever observe, teetering on being farcical at times, yet being sincerely compelling at other times. Overall, it is hard to become attached to the characters in Nil by Mouth. They certainly tell a fascinatingly twisted story, but don't expect to find any sympathy left in your heart when it's all over. This film disturbs me more than entertains me, but that is obviously the point. It is so harrowing and so horrendous that I can't guarantee you will want to watch it again once it's over. I'm not sure that I do, but I don't regret watching it by any means. Gary Oldman needs to try his luck with directing again one of these days, because his first attempt has gone pretty well.

    Its very rare that I rate something 10 out of 10 but Nil By Mouth deserves it. What really really nags me is that this excellent film is poorly rated by Americans and Canadians etc that just don't get the lingo etc. Or the fact that Nil By Mouth is 'too grim' to applaud. I mean, had this been some less violent American movie by some A list actors then they would of gotten Oscar nominations and all sorts. The fact is this film is too real for most people. It has a lot of heart and reality to it. Its so gritty and raw and exploding with substance I cant believe how much Nil By Mouth is overlooked. AS far as I'm concerned this is the British Once Were Warriors, another great film but from New Zealand. I praise Gary Oldman for making such an honest, from the heart film. It is so rare nowadays to see something like Nil By Mouth. Kathy Burke is fantastic as the abused wife, and Ray Winstone equally as fantastic as the abuser and raging alcoholic. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. I really wish films like this existed today, sadly no one has the balls, vision or creativeness. Top film. If you think this film has no artistic merit then you really haven't got a clue. Its unique.

    ...and when I say reality,I mean just that. A universal reality. I've only been to London once for a concert and I stayed there for 3 days, so I'm not at all qualified to say that this is a slice of proletarian London life, and yet I felt the unequivocal and bland smell of real life right from the first frame.And that's because Gary Oldman manages to capture the universal drama of human life and emotion.He manages that through some really uninteresting dialog, some ordinary issues (poverty,macho-British style,hopelessness,addiction,abuse) and almost no cinematic thrills or gimmicks. The problem is that we are so used to those cinematic artifices that a movie like this one comes across as a flat line on a hospital machine. Not even when we have a climatic scene of Ray savagely beating his wife, I didn't feel terrified or like turning away in disgust because the by then the movie painstakingly tells the viewer that that's how it is and there is nothing to do about it, in other words, you're already emotionally numb and somehow not involved. Oldman considers this a semi-autobiographical movie. Add to that the way it is presented to us and it sheds some light as to why he's such a gifted, unconventional and unique actor, he clearly takes his energy, feelings and life experience from some unusual places. Absolutely shattering stuff.

    English actor Gary Oldman sunk $1.5 million of his own money into NIL BY MOUTH, a film he wrote and directed. It is an noncommercial film set in and around the London of his youth - a South London council estate where the sun never shines (these films always work best when shot in winter) and everything has a grey, washed out look to it. There's no real plot in NIL BY MOUTH. It focuses on villain Ray (Ray Winstone), his wife (Kathy Burke) and her brother (Charlie Creed Mills). The film often seems to consist of long scenes of people boozing, swearing and shooting up heroin. Much of the dialogue consists of the 'F' word used over and over again. Oldman does have an acute ear for discomforting dialogue (one character says of a woman he saw "getting a severe portion right up the f**king Gary") - it never sounds scripted and the whole film seems to happening spontaneously in front of the camera. Winstone delivers a career-best performance as the drunk Ray and Kathy Burke (who won the Best Actress prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for this role) wears an expression of down-trodden weariness on her face in every scene. When Ray beats her up in a drunken rage (she is pregnant at the time), it's a wince inducing scene complete with moans of pain from Burke. It's an astonishing moment that stays with you days, months, even years after you witness it. This is the underclass at its rawest and filmmaking at its rawest. It's grimness and imagery burns into your mind and once seen you'll find it difficult to shake or forget, a distinction it shares with Alan Clarke's SCUM - and Clarke was one of Oldman's stated influences when shooting the movie.

    I'm a sucker for Cockney films. I've got a few Cockney mates & I'm fascinated by their accent, slang & wit, but this is not Lock, Stock & Two Smoking, mate. Not even close. I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog. (English subtitles would have come in handy here.) But the very realism that makes this film so brilliant is what makes it so excruciating to watch. First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke. Nil by Mouth is about family  & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand  in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone  is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time. Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly  clearly still in a lot of pain  but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance. Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy  you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that  but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is. And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep. The ending is left open to interpretation. This isn't Hollywood; there never was a plot, nothing's neatly resolved, no comforting closure here. Is this a temporary truce or is it worse, a genuine rapprochement? It's impossible for the viewer to forgive Ray his brutality, and yet you're left with the sinking feeling that Val will & the cycle will go on.

    This is Gary Oldman's only directorial role. He is known for playing villains and difficult characters in a range of movies, and is known for having taken many "integrity roles" - not pandering to Hollywood-style movie star roles. His work as an actor is outstanding and suggests he loves theatre and film, and thinks seriously about the roles he accepts. So, his directorial debut should be judged by a high standard. Fortunately, it surpasses expectations. This is movie about working class London life. It is gritty, it is dark, it is heavy. It doesn't try to build up an idea of London Gangster, as other movies of this ilk seem prone to doing. There is no sense that the movie is an attempt to posture or create a "British ghetto cool" in response to American Gangster or Ghetto movies. It is unflinching in it's portrayal of housing estate life, heroin addiction, and families flawed on many levels. It doesn't romanticise any of this. But, despite the dark mood of the piece, and the coarseness of the characters involved, you do get a feeling that this family love each other and care about each other. Sometimes, this causes tension - as a viewer, you can't help feeling life might be better for each member of this family if they just went their separate ways. But, true to life, they stick together, in the face of continual betrayals, violence, angers, and destruction. And they keep a dark sense of humour throughout. As someone who has experienced the environment portrayed int his film, I found it highly realistic. The humour was twisted, but genuinely so - in times of such strife, gallows humour comes to the surface. And the continuing sense that the next crisis is only a lift ride away makes this movie forceful and unforgiving in it's portrayal of British street life.

    If you are heavily offended by the F or C word, or it's even taboo, forget about watching this film. Nil By Mouth is reality unfolding, before our very eyes. Ray Winstone gives a ferocious performance as a drug dealer ex parolee, also a heavy boozer, who likes to down a beer after a wine. Unfortunately his boozing leads to his habitual wife bashing. This time around it had devastating consequences. His long suffering wife, (Kathy Burke in a standout performance) has a heroin addict for brother, also an ex parolee (Charlie Creed Miles, who adds another A grade performance to this film). He's totally believable, especially in his desperation for another fix, mostly in scenes where he's having heated arguments with his mother (Oldman's real life sister). The montage song for this, I loved by the way. Nil by Mouth is not a plot driven movie. It's real life, and a kind of situation movie too. It's a movie based on Oldman's background, as a kid, growing up. Ray Winstone, who's got his career back on track after this 1998 film, has become one of my favorite actors. I'm glad he did too, as cinema has missed a movie great for far too long. The first half an hour has Winstone, and his best mate (Jamie Foreman) spinning gags and telling stories that you become involved with, one especially involving one of their mad crim mates. Even later on, after Winstone has gone berserk, tearing up his place, as if a buffalo charged through it, we have a scene with him spilling his sad childhood, about fatherly neglect onto his mate (Jamie Foreman), a patient and supportive listener, as shown in some other scenes as well, the kind of mate, everyone should have. The constant use of expletives, and I use constant with a capital C was true to fact from Oldman's perspective from what I heard. I've never heard a higher use of curses in film. At times the constant expletives become too much, but they're in those intense explosive scenes, Winstone's ones that work for it so darn well. E.g. like where he's trying to get his daughter back, causing a ruckus with other neighbors. You could see this happening anywhere. In life, we have our bad times and good times, one good time, clearly reflected in the last scene where everything's back on an evening keel, and Winstone's re-united with wife and daughter. It's cute, this scene with him, snuggling his daughter. These are moments you cherish and hold onto. It's one of the movie's best scenes. Another one is him, play fighting with his wife's mother, a tough steadfast oldie, who puts up her dukes. She doesn't have a bad singing voice to match, either, we discover. The other scene that's particularly impressive, is Winstone alone, liquored up, calling the wife. When he hangs up, he resumes a conversation, picking up his handset phone again, and banging it many times against it's receiver, while delivering an apologetic conversation, as if his wife (who's bashed face looks like a steamroller went over it) is there. This is followed by him defending himself, blaming the wife. This guy has really been torn in some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. We actually can't help feeling sorry for the guy, in spite of the consequences, prior to his violent acts, one murderous, which is most unforgiving. Winstone is one of those actors, like Ray Liotta, who can play rage and anger with brilliant believability, and also be threatening. Winstone's character is someone you wouldn't want get on their bad side, or meet in a dark alley. But it's Burke as the abused wife that rises above the other performances. That Kevin and Perry crap doesn't do her justice. The most effective NBM moment is near the start, during one of those stories, where Burke in the background, literally shakes for a couple of seconds while rigidly holding a coffee, as if the F words have become all too much, and too, this abuse has been going on for much too long. The bashing scene, where we see Ray's proud shirtless body, as he pounds on his wifee, who by the way is pregnant, will disturb some I imagine as it kind of did me, as he shouts the C word in a succession. One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia: Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand. Excellent, and in one sense, a sheer masterpiece, that MUST be viewed.

    It's always a fun experience to watch an actors shift to the director chair. Such is the story behind Nil by Mouth, the directorial debut of Gary Oldman, one of the finest actors working today. Oldman himself does not appear in the film, but a whole collection of fantastic actors do instead. The film is a brutal story of a dysfunctional family living in London. This distraught and detached family struggles to stay together, having to battle one brothers heroin addiction, anothers short temper and violent tendencies, as well as the general debauchery that occurs within the lives of these people. This isn't a pleasant film and it isn't a happy film. It's a brutal depiction of London working-class districts and it will certainly disturb you to your core. The brutality of Nil by Mouth is unheard of. The film is a non-stop stream of cursing, graphic drug uses, and despicable violence. The film never lets up on the atrocity, leaving you no time to catch your breath. It's a fast moving film; one that doesn't stop to explain things and doesn't spell everything out for you. It's a completely character driven story with more character development in it than actual events occurring. Yet, enough happens to make the film plenty interesting. It slows down towards the middle as it sets up for its somber ending that leaves you with a strange and uneasy feeling in your stomach. Now, I'm always up for a great character driven story, but you have to be prepared for a lot going into Nil by Mouth. The thing is, the characters in this film are not likable in the least. They are the most despicable, deplorable, horridly atrocious people you've ever laid eyes on. Apart from them being sleazy and unattractive, they all possess the most unflattering personalities. The film presents a very strange family dynamic, having the characters constantly switch between love and hate for one another. Billy, the brother with the terrible heroin addiction, has his own mother give him drug money and also provides him with a place to shoot up. This seems like the most brutal form of motherly love until the two scream at each other a scene later, throwing the most horrendous profanities at one another. It is indeed some of the strangest relationships you could ever observe, teetering on being farcical at times, yet being sincerely compelling at other times. Overall, it is hard to become attached to the characters in Nil by Mouth. They certainly tell a fascinatingly twisted story, but don't expect to find any sympathy left in your heart when it's all over. This film disturbs me more than entertains me, but that is obviously the point. It is so harrowing and so horrendous that I can't guarantee you will want to watch it again once it's over. I'm not sure that I do, but I don't regret watching it by any means. Gary Oldman needs to try his luck with directing again one of these days, because his first attempt has gone pretty well.

    Its very rare that I rate something 10 out of 10 but Nil By Mouth deserves it. What really really nags me is that this excellent film is poorly rated by Americans and Canadians etc that just don't get the lingo etc. Or the fact that Nil By Mouth is 'too grim' to applaud. I mean, had this been some less violent American movie by some A list actors then they would of gotten Oscar nominations and all sorts. The fact is this film is too real for most people. It has a lot of heart and reality to it. Its so gritty and raw and exploding with substance I cant believe how much Nil By Mouth is overlooked. AS far as I'm concerned this is the British Once Were Warriors, another great film but from New Zealand. I praise Gary Oldman for making such an honest, from the heart film. It is so rare nowadays to see something like Nil By Mouth. Kathy Burke is fantastic as the abused wife, and Ray Winstone equally as fantastic as the abuser and raging alcoholic. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. I really wish films like this existed today, sadly no one has the balls, vision or creativeness. Top film. If you think this film has no artistic merit then you really haven't got a clue. Its unique.

    ...and when I say reality,I mean just that. A universal reality. I've only been to London once for a concert and I stayed there for 3 days, so I'm not at all qualified to say that this is a slice of proletarian London life, and yet I felt the unequivocal and bland smell of real life right from the first frame.And that's because Gary Oldman manages to capture the universal drama of human life and emotion.He manages that through some really uninteresting dialog, some ordinary issues (poverty,macho-British style,hopelessness,addiction,abuse) and almost no cinematic thrills or gimmicks. The problem is that we are so used to those cinematic artifices that a movie like this one comes across as a flat line on a hospital machine. Not even when we have a climatic scene of Ray savagely beating his wife, I didn't feel terrified or like turning away in disgust because the by then the movie painstakingly tells the viewer that that's how it is and there is nothing to do about it, in other words, you're already emotionally numb and somehow not involved. Oldman considers this a semi-autobiographical movie. Add to that the way it is presented to us and it sheds some light as to why he's such a gifted, unconventional and unique actor, he clearly takes his energy, feelings and life experience from some unusual places. Absolutely shattering stuff.

    English actor Gary Oldman sunk $1.5 million of his own money into NIL BY MOUTH, a film he wrote and directed. It is an noncommercial film set in and around the London of his youth - a South London council estate where the sun never shines (these films always work best when shot in winter) and everything has a grey, washed out look to it. There's no real plot in NIL BY MOUTH. It focuses on villain Ray (Ray Winstone), his wife (Kathy Burke) and her brother (Charlie Creed Mills). The film often seems to consist of long scenes of people boozing, swearing and shooting up heroin. Much of the dialogue consists of the 'F' word used over and over again. Oldman does have an acute ear for discomforting dialogue (one character says of a woman he saw "getting a severe portion right up the f**king Gary") - it never sounds scripted and the whole film seems to happening spontaneously in front of the camera. Winstone delivers a career-best performance as the drunk Ray and Kathy Burke (who won the Best Actress prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for this role) wears an expression of down-trodden weariness on her face in every scene. When Ray beats her up in a drunken rage (she is pregnant at the time), it's a wince inducing scene complete with moans of pain from Burke. It's an astonishing moment that stays with you days, months, even years after you witness it. This is the underclass at its rawest and filmmaking at its rawest. It's grimness and imagery burns into your mind and once seen you'll find it difficult to shake or forget, a distinction it shares with Alan Clarke's SCUM - and Clarke was one of Oldman's stated influences when shooting the movie.

    I'm a sucker for Cockney films. I've got a few Cockney mates & I'm fascinated by their accent, slang & wit, but this is not Lock, Stock & Two Smoking, mate. Not even close. I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog. (English subtitles would have come in handy here.) But the very realism that makes this film so brilliant is what makes it so excruciating to watch. First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke. Nil by Mouth is about family  & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand  in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone  is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time. Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly  clearly still in a lot of pain  but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance. Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy  you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that  but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is. And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep. The ending is left open to interpretation. This isn't Hollywood; there never was a plot, nothing's neatly resolved, no comforting closure here. Is this a temporary truce or is it worse, a genuine rapprochement? It's impossible for the viewer to forgive Ray his brutality, and yet you're left with the sinking feeling that Val will & the cycle will go on.

    This is Gary Oldman's only directorial role. He is known for playing villains and difficult characters in a range of movies, and is known for having taken many "integrity roles" - not pandering to Hollywood-style movie star roles. His work as an actor is outstanding and suggests he loves theatre and film, and thinks seriously about the roles he accepts. So, his directorial debut should be judged by a high standard. Fortunately, it surpasses expectations. This is movie about working class London life. It is gritty, it is dark, it is heavy. It doesn't try to build up an idea of London Gangster, as other movies of this ilk seem prone to doing. There is no sense that the movie is an attempt to posture or create a "British ghetto cool" in response to American Gangster or Ghetto movies. It is unflinching in it's portrayal of housing estate life, heroin addiction, and families flawed on many levels. It doesn't romanticise any of this. But, despite the dark mood of the piece, and the coarseness of the characters involved, you do get a feeling that this family love each other and care about each other. Sometimes, this causes tension - as a viewer, you can't help feeling life might be better for each member of this family if they just went their separate ways. But, true to life, they stick together, in the face of continual betrayals, violence, angers, and destruction. And they keep a dark sense of humour throughout. As someone who has experienced the environment portrayed int his film, I found it highly realistic. The humour was twisted, but genuinely so - in times of such strife, gallows humour comes to the surface. And the continuing sense that the next crisis is only a lift ride away makes this movie forceful and unforgiving in it's portrayal of British street life.

    If you are heavily offended by the F or C word, or it's even taboo, forget about watching this film. Nil By Mouth is reality unfolding, before our very eyes. Ray Winstone gives a ferocious performance as a drug dealer ex parolee, also a heavy boozer, who likes to down a beer after a wine. Unfortunately his boozing leads to his habitual wife bashing. This time around it had devastating consequences. His long suffering wife, (Kathy Burke in a standout performance) has a heroin addict for brother, also an ex parolee (Charlie Creed Miles, who adds another A grade performance to this film). He's totally believable, especially in his desperation for another fix, mostly in scenes where he's having heated arguments with his mother (Oldman's real life sister). The montage song for this, I loved by the way. Nil by Mouth is not a plot driven movie. It's real life, and a kind of situation movie too. It's a movie based on Oldman's background, as a kid, growing up. Ray Winstone, who's got his career back on track after this 1998 film, has become one of my favorite actors. I'm glad he did too, as cinema has missed a movie great for far too long. The first half an hour has Winstone, and his best mate (Jamie Foreman) spinning gags and telling stories that you become involved with, one especially involving one of their mad crim mates. Even later on, after Winstone has gone berserk, tearing up his place, as if a buffalo charged through it, we have a scene with him spilling his sad childhood, about fatherly neglect onto his mate (Jamie Foreman), a patient and supportive listener, as shown in some other scenes as well, the kind of mate, everyone should have. The constant use of expletives, and I use constant with a capital C was true to fact from Oldman's perspective from what I heard. I've never heard a higher use of curses in film. At times the constant expletives become too much, but they're in those intense explosive scenes, Winstone's ones that work for it so darn well. E.g. like where he's trying to get his daughter back, causing a ruckus with other neighbors. You could see this happening anywhere. In life, we have our bad times and good times, one good time, clearly reflected in the last scene where everything's back on an evening keel, and Winstone's re-united with wife and daughter. It's cute, this scene with him, snuggling his daughter. These are moments you cherish and hold onto. It's one of the movie's best scenes. Another one is him, play fighting with his wife's mother, a tough steadfast oldie, who puts up her dukes. She doesn't have a bad singing voice to match, either, we discover. The other scene that's particularly impressive, is Winstone alone, liquored up, calling the wife. When he hangs up, he resumes a conversation, picking up his handset phone again, and banging it many times against it's receiver, while delivering an apologetic conversation, as if his wife (who's bashed face looks like a steamroller went over it) is there. This is followed by him defending himself, blaming the wife. This guy has really been torn in some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. We actually can't help feeling sorry for the guy, in spite of the consequences, prior to his violent acts, one murderous, which is most unforgiving. Winstone is one of those actors, like Ray Liotta, who can play rage and anger with brilliant believability, and also be threatening. Winstone's character is someone you wouldn't want get on their bad side, or meet in a dark alley. But it's Burke as the abused wife that rises above the other performances. That Kevin and Perry crap doesn't do her justice. The most effective NBM moment is near the start, during one of those stories, where Burke in the background, literally shakes for a couple of seconds while rigidly holding a coffee, as if the F words have become all too much, and too, this abuse has been going on for much too long. The bashing scene, where we see Ray's proud shirtless body, as he pounds on his wifee, who by the way is pregnant, will disturb some I imagine as it kind of did me, as he shouts the C word in a succession. One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia: Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand. Excellent, and in one sense, a sheer masterpiece, that MUST be viewed.

    'Nil By Mouth' is a potent, relentless dose of real life; a portrait of the dead-end cycle of violence, abuse, addiction and poverty that occurs in cities all over the world. Though a trifle convoluted (there are a few scenes that contribute little or nothing to the film), it is a genuinely moving, visceral experience. Don't be mistaken, this is not another trashy British gangster flick, far from it. Ray Winstone(Ray) and Kathy Burke (Valerie) are both tremendous, their performances stop the film from descending into the realm of 'The Football Factory' or 'Rise of the Footsoldier'. It's also the script that distinguishes it from such films which, on face value, appear comparable. The script has ample profanity, and I really mean ample, it's the most profane film I've ever seen, but it also has segments of real poignancy. Burke and Winstone interpreted the script perfectly. Winstone's performance is unsettlingly convincing; some may say he's one-dimensional, but he really is a rather good actor. It is Kathy Burke's moments that are the most moving, chiefly a scene where she desperately tells a white-lie: it's genuinely upsetting. The film is rightfully spared of romanticism, it's completely devoid of poetic licence, what you see is pure, candid realism. Ironically, the film isn't pure at all, it's gritty and unrestrained in its depiction of violence and vulgarity; one moment being particularly horrifying. To criticise the film for being 'unfocused' is missing the point. To me, it was an almost non- linear insight into the human condition, a film woven from the personal experiences of Gary Oldman and delivered with the utmost conviction from Burke, Winstone and indeed the whole cast.

    Nil By Mouth is not a film made for enjoyment - or even entertainment, for that matter. This is a raw, gritty insight into the very real world of alcoholism, abusive relationships, and general dysfunction. In his directorial debut, Gary Oldman makes no attempt to sugarcoat his perception of life in South London. Utilizing rough dialogue, claustrophobic camera work, grim lighting, and a constant presence of violent tension, he has instead created a cathartic and uncomfortably honest atmosphere from start to finish. The entire cast is pitch-perfect for what this film is trying to achieve- that being to divert from the typical Hollywood 'art imitating life' and into the real, unglamorous, and painful lives that thousands of people world-wide have to face every day. They are not in this film for their looks or reputation, but rather for their ability to capture what it is to be human in broken circumstances. They don't make practiced faces into the camera. They don't spew out Oscar-ready monologues. They don't shed the single, pretty tear down the cheek. No. They forget about the camera's presence and do exactly what you and I would do in their given situations, making them better actors than most A-Listers that you'll see today. Nil By Mouth is a thoroughly unpleasant 2 hour watch, and it will certainly be difficult to sit through. Never-the-less, it is a film that needs to be watched. While film is a great medium for escaping our daily hardships, it can also be used as a means of opening our eyes to the crueler side of life - the life of our neighbours, our friends, or even ourselves. Oldman has achieved this without mercy or restraint, and as a result has created a masterful study of every-day horrors.

    Gary Oldman's, Nil by Mouth (1997) is a gritty, dark, bleak and powerful movie with constant extremely strong language and unprecedented realism. The Movie nails 522 F-words (The most from any official motion picture film) The documentary on the F-word isn't classed as an official movie. And has more C-words than any other film with at least 82 (Maybe up to a hundred) So I strongly suggest AVOIDING this if you can't stand bad language and all emotional viewers should steer clear as the film can be tough to watch at times. The positives are huge though,which is why I rated this film (My 1st official IMDb Review) as a whopping 10/10. The acting is so believable and convincing. It makes you feel like you are watching a documentary somehow with that amazing realism in the atmosphere. It's so gripping to watch and will leave you in shock after watching thinking WOW! What a film. It has that impact. The film received 2 Bafta's and deserves It's awards because It's a corker. Gary Oldman: Excellent actor, writer & director. Ray Winstone's best performance (IMO) in any film by a long shot. And Kathy Burke was exceptional along with him. A real gem masterpiece. Take my word for it and watch it!

Add to that the way it is presented to us and it sheds some light as to why he's such a gifted, unconventional and unique actor, he clearly takes his energy, feelings and life experience from some unusual places. Absolutely shattering stuff.

    English actor Gary Oldman sunk $1.5 million of his own money into NIL BY MOUTH, a film he wrote and directed. It is an noncommercial film set in and around the London of his youth - a South London council estate where the sun never shines (these films always work best when shot in winter) and everything has a grey, washed out look to it. There's no real plot in NIL BY MOUTH. It focuses on villain Ray (Ray Winstone), his wife (Kathy Burke) and her brother (Charlie Creed Mills). The film often seems to consist of long scenes of people boozing, swearing and shooting up heroin. Much of the dialogue consists of the 'F' word used over and over again. Oldman does have an acute ear for discomforting dialogue (one character says of a woman he saw "getting a severe portion right up the f**king Gary") - it never sounds scripted and the whole film seems to happening spontaneously in front of the camera. Winstone delivers a career-best performance as the drunk Ray and Kathy Burke (who won the Best Actress prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for this role) wears an expression of down-trodden weariness on her face in every scene. When Ray beats her up in a drunken rage (she is pregnant at the time), it's a wince inducing scene complete with moans of pain from Burke. It's an astonishing moment that stays with you days, months, even years after you witness it. This is the underclass at its rawest and filmmaking at its rawest. It's grimness and imagery burns into your mind and once seen you'll find it difficult to shake or forget, a distinction it shares with Alan Clarke's SCUM - and Clarke was one of Oldman's stated influences when shooting the movie.

    I'm a sucker for Cockney films. I've got a few Cockney mates & I'm fascinated by their accent, slang & wit, but this is not Lock, Stock & Two Smoking, mate. Not even close. I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog. (English subtitles would have come in handy here.) But the very realism that makes this film so brilliant is what makes it so excruciating to watch. First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke. Nil by Mouth is about family  & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand  in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone  is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time. Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly  clearly still in a lot of pain  but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance. Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy  you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that  but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is. And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep. The ending is left open to interpretation. This isn't Hollywood; there never was a plot, nothing's neatly resolved, no comforting closure here. Is this a temporary truce or is it worse, a genuine rapprochement? It's impossible for the viewer to forgive Ray his brutality, and yet you're left with the sinking feeling that Val will & the cycle will go on.

    This is Gary Oldman's only directorial role. He is known for playing villains and difficult characters in a range of movies, and is known for having taken many "integrity roles" - not pandering to Hollywood-style movie star roles. His work as an actor is outstanding and suggests he loves theatre and film, and thinks seriously about the roles he accepts. So, his directorial debut should be judged by a high standard. Fortunately, it surpasses expectations. This is movie about working class London life. It is gritty, it is dark, it is heavy. It doesn't try to build up an idea of London Gangster, as other movies of this ilk seem prone to doing. There is no sense that the movie is an attempt to posture or create a "British ghetto cool" in response to American Gangster or Ghetto movies. It is unflinching in it's portrayal of housing estate life, heroin addiction, and families flawed on many levels. It doesn't romanticise any of this. But, despite the dark mood of the piece, and the coarseness of the characters involved, you do get a feeling that this family love each other and care about each other. Sometimes, this causes tension - as a viewer, you can't help feeling life might be better for each member of this family if they just went their separate ways. But, true to life, they stick together, in the face of continual betrayals, violence, angers, and destruction. And they keep a dark sense of humour throughout. As someone who has experienced the environment portrayed int his film, I found it highly realistic. The humour was twisted, but genuinely so - in times of such strife, gallows humour comes to the surface. And the continuing sense that the next crisis is only a lift ride away makes this movie forceful and unforgiving in it's portrayal of British street life.

    If you are heavily offended by the F or C word, or it's even taboo, forget about watching this film. Nil By Mouth is reality unfolding, before our very eyes. Ray Winstone gives a ferocious performance as a drug dealer ex parolee, also a heavy boozer, who likes to down a beer after a wine. Unfortunately his boozing leads to his habitual wife bashing. This time around it had devastating consequences. His long suffering wife, (Kathy Burke in a standout performance) has a heroin addict for brother, also an ex parolee (Charlie Creed Miles, who adds another A grade performance to this film). He's totally believable, especially in his desperation for another fix, mostly in scenes where he's having heated arguments with his mother (Oldman's real life sister). The montage song for this, I loved by the way. Nil by Mouth is not a plot driven movie. It's real life, and a kind of situation movie too. It's a movie based on Oldman's background, as a kid, growing up. Ray Winstone, who's got his career back on track after this 1998 film, has become one of my favorite actors. I'm glad he did too, as cinema has missed a movie great for far too long. The first half an hour has Winstone, and his best mate (Jamie Foreman) spinning gags and telling stories that you become involved with, one especially involving one of their mad crim mates. Even later on, after Winstone has gone berserk, tearing up his place, as if a buffalo charged through it, we have a scene with him spilling his sad childhood, about fatherly neglect onto his mate (Jamie Foreman), a patient and supportive listener, as shown in some other scenes as well, the kind of mate, everyone should have. The constant use of expletives, and I use constant with a capital C was true to fact from Oldman's perspective from what I heard. I've never heard a higher use of curses in film. At times the constant expletives become too much, but they're in those intense explosive scenes, Winstone's ones that work for it so darn well. E.g. like where he's trying to get his daughter back, causing a ruckus with other neighbors. You could see this happening anywhere. In life, we have our bad times and good times, one good time, clearly reflected in the last scene where everything's back on an evening keel, and Winstone's re-united with wife and daughter. It's cute, this scene with him, snuggling his daughter. These are moments you cherish and hold onto. It's one of the movie's best scenes. Another one is him, play fighting with his wife's mother, a tough steadfast oldie, who puts up her dukes. She doesn't have a bad singing voice to match, either, we discover. The other scene that's particularly impressive, is Winstone alone, liquored up, calling the wife. When he hangs up, he resumes a conversation, picking up his handset phone again, and banging it many times against it's receiver, while delivering an apologetic conversation, as if his wife (who's bashed face looks like a steamroller went over it) is there. This is followed by him defending himself, blaming the wife. This guy has really been torn in some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. We actually can't help feeling sorry for the guy, in spite of the consequences, prior to his violent acts, one murderous, which is most unforgiving. Winstone is one of those actors, like Ray Liotta, who can play rage and anger with brilliant believability, and also be threatening. Winstone's character is someone you wouldn't want get on their bad side, or meet in a dark alley. But it's Burke as the abused wife that rises above the other performances. That Kevin and Perry crap doesn't do her justice. The most effective NBM moment is near the start, during one of those stories, where Burke in the background, literally shakes for a couple of seconds while rigidly holding a coffee, as if the F words have become all too much, and too, this abuse has been going on for much too long. The bashing scene, where we see Ray's proud shirtless body, as he pounds on his wifee, who by the way is pregnant, will disturb some I imagine as it kind of did me, as he shouts the C word in a succession. One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia: Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand. Excellent, and in one sense, a sheer masterpiece, that MUST be viewed.

    'Nil By Mouth' is a potent, relentless dose of real life; a portrait of the dead-end cycle of violence, abuse, addiction and poverty that occurs in cities all over the world. Though a trifle convoluted (there are a few scenes that contribute little or nothing to the film), it is a genuinely moving, visceral experience. Don't be mistaken, this is not another trashy British gangster flick, far from it. Ray Winstone(Ray) and Kathy Burke (Valerie) are both tremendous, their performances stop the film from descending into the realm of 'The Football Factory' or 'Rise of the Footsoldier'. It's also the script that distinguishes it from such films which, on face value, appear comparable. The script has ample profanity, and I really mean ample, it's the most profane film I've ever seen, but it also has segments of real poignancy. Burke and Winstone interpreted the script perfectly. Winstone's performance is unsettlingly convincing; some may say he's one-dimensional, but he really is a rather good actor. It is Kathy Burke's moments that are the most moving, chiefly a scene where she desperately tells a white-lie: it's genuinely upsetting. The film is rightfully spared of romanticism, it's completely devoid of poetic licence, what you see is pure, candid realism. Ironically, the film isn't pure at all, it's gritty and unrestrained in its depiction of violence and vulgarity; one moment being particularly horrifying. To criticise the film for being 'unfocused' is missing the point. To me, it was an almost non- linear insight into the human condition, a film woven from the personal experiences of Gary Oldman and delivered with the utmost conviction from Burke, Winstone and indeed the whole cast.

    Nil By Mouth is not a film made for enjoyment - or even entertainment, for that matter. This is a raw, gritty insight into the very real world of alcoholism, abusive relationships, and general dysfunction. In his directorial debut, Gary Oldman makes no attempt to sugarcoat his perception of life in South London. Utilizing rough dialogue, claustrophobic camera work, grim lighting, and a constant presence of violent tension, he has instead created a cathartic and uncomfortably honest atmosphere from start to finish. The entire cast is pitch-perfect for what this film is trying to achieve- that being to divert from the typical Hollywood 'art imitating life' and into the real, unglamorous, and painful lives that thousands of people world-wide have to face every day. They are not in this film for their looks or reputation, but rather for their ability to capture what it is to be human in broken circumstances. They don't make practiced faces into the camera. They don't spew out Oscar-ready monologues. They don't shed the single, pretty tear down the cheek. No. They forget about the camera's presence and do exactly what you and I would do in their given situations, making them better actors than most A-Listers that you'll see today. Nil By Mouth is a thoroughly unpleasant 2 hour watch, and it will certainly be difficult to sit through. Never-the-less, it is a film that needs to be watched. While film is a great medium for escaping our daily hardships, it can also be used as a means of opening our eyes to the crueler side of life - the life of our neighbours, our friends, or even ourselves. Oldman has achieved this without mercy or restraint, and as a result has created a masterful study of every-day horrors.

    Gary Oldman's, Nil by Mouth (1997) is a gritty, dark, bleak and powerful movie with constant extremely strong language and unprecedented realism. The Movie nails 522 F-words (The most from any official motion picture film) The documentary on the F-word isn't classed as an official movie. And has more C-words than any other film with at least 82 (Maybe up to a hundred) So I strongly suggest AVOIDING this if you can't stand bad language and all emotional viewers should steer clear as the film can be tough to watch at times. The positives are huge though,which is why I rated this film (My 1st official IMDb Review) as a whopping 10/10. The acting is so believable and convincing. It makes you feel like you are watching a documentary somehow with that amazing realism in the atmosphere. It's so gripping to watch and will leave you in shock after watching thinking WOW! What a film. It has that impact. The film received 2 Bafta's and deserves It's awards because It's a corker. Gary Oldman: Excellent actor, writer & director. Ray Winstone's best performance (IMO) in any film by a long shot. And Kathy Burke was exceptional along with him. A real gem masterpiece. Take my word for it and watch it!

    It's always a fun experience to watch an actors shift to the director chair. Such is the story behind Nil by Mouth, the directorial debut of Gary Oldman, one of the finest actors working today. Oldman himself does not appear in the film, but a whole collection of fantastic actors do instead. The film is a brutal story of a dysfunctional family living in London. This distraught and detached family struggles to stay together, having to battle one brothers heroin addiction, anothers short temper and violent tendencies, as well as the general debauchery that occurs within the lives of these people. This isn't a pleasant film and it isn't a happy film. It's a brutal depiction of London working-class districts and it will certainly disturb you to your core. The brutality of Nil by Mouth is unheard of. The film is a non-stop stream of cursing, graphic drug uses, and despicable violence. The film never lets up on the atrocity, leaving you no time to catch your breath. It's a fast moving film; one that doesn't stop to explain things and doesn't spell everything out for you. It's a completely character driven story with more character development in it than actual events occurring. Yet, enough happens to make the film plenty interesting. It slows down towards the middle as it sets up for its somber ending that leaves you with a strange and uneasy feeling in your stomach. Now, I'm always up for a great character driven story, but you have to be prepared for a lot going into Nil by Mouth. The thing is, the characters in this film are not likable in the least. They are the most despicable, deplorable, horridly atrocious people you've ever laid eyes on. Apart from them being sleazy and unattractive, they all possess the most unflattering personalities. The film presents a very strange family dynamic, having the characters constantly switch between love and hate for one another. Billy, the brother with the terrible heroin addiction, has his own mother give him drug money and also provides him with a place to shoot up. This seems like the most brutal form of motherly love until the two scream at each other a scene later, throwing the most horrendous profanities at one another. It is indeed some of the strangest relationships you could ever observe, teetering on being farcical at times, yet being sincerely compelling at other times. Overall, it is hard to become attached to the characters in Nil by Mouth. They certainly tell a fascinatingly twisted story, but don't expect to find any sympathy left in your heart when it's all over. This film disturbs me more than entertains me, but that is obviously the point. It is so harrowing and so horrendous that I can't guarantee you will want to watch it again once it's over. I'm not sure that I do, but I don't regret watching it by any means. Gary Oldman needs to try his luck with directing again one of these days, because his first attempt has gone pretty well.

    Its very rare that I rate something 10 out of 10 but Nil By Mouth deserves it. What really really nags me is that this excellent film is poorly rated by Americans and Canadians etc that just don't get the lingo etc. Or the fact that Nil By Mouth is 'too grim' to applaud. I mean, had this been some less violent American movie by some A list actors then they would of gotten Oscar nominations and all sorts. The fact is this film is too real for most people. It has a lot of heart and reality to it. Its so gritty and raw and exploding with substance I cant believe how much Nil By Mouth is overlooked. AS far as I'm concerned this is the British Once Were Warriors, another great film but from New Zealand. I praise Gary Oldman for making such an honest, from the heart film. It is so rare nowadays to see something like Nil By Mouth. Kathy Burke is fantastic as the abused wife, and Ray Winstone equally as fantastic as the abuser and raging alcoholic. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. I really wish films like this existed today, sadly no one has the balls, vision or creativeness. Top film. If you think this film has no artistic merit then you really haven't got a clue. Its unique.

    ...and when I say reality,I mean just that. A universal reality. I've only been to London once for a concert and I stayed there for 3 days, so I'm not at all qualified to say that this is a slice of proletarian London life, and yet I felt the unequivocal and bland smell of real life right from the first frame.And that's because Gary Oldman manages to capture the universal drama of human life and emotion.He manages that through some really uninteresting dialog, some ordinary issues (poverty,macho-British style,hopelessness,addiction,abuse) and almost no cinematic thrills or gimmicks. The problem is that we are so used to those cinematic artifices that a movie like this one comes across as a flat line on a hospital machine. Not even when we have a climatic scene of Ray savagely beating his wife, I didn't feel terrified or like turning away in disgust because the by then the movie painstakingly tells the viewer that that's how it is and there is nothing to do about it, in other words, you're already emotionally numb and somehow not involved. Oldman considers this a semi-autobiographical movie. Add to that the way it is presented to us and it sheds some light as to why he's such a gifted, unconventional and unique actor, he clearly takes his energy, feelings and life experience from some unusual places. Absolutely shattering stuff.

I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog.

First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke. Nil by Mouth is about family  & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand  in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone  is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time. Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly  clearly still in a lot of pain  but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance. Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy  you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that  but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is. And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep. The ending is left open to interpretation.

    This is Gary Oldman's only directorial role. He is known for playing villains and difficult characters in a range of movies, and is known for having taken many "integrity roles" - not pandering to Hollywood-style movie star roles. His work as an actor is outstanding and suggests he loves theatre and film, and thinks seriously about the roles he accepts. So, his directorial debut should be judged by a high standard. Fortunately, it surpasses expectations. This is movie about working class London life. It is gritty, it is dark, it is heavy. It doesn't try to build up an idea of London Gangster, as other movies of this ilk seem prone to doing. There is no sense that the movie is an attempt to posture or create a "British ghetto cool" in response to American Gangster or Ghetto movies. It is unflinching in it's portrayal of housing estate life, heroin addiction, and families flawed on many levels. It doesn't romanticise any of this. But, despite the dark mood of the piece, and the coarseness of the characters involved, you do get a feeling that this family love each other and care about each other. Sometimes, this causes tension - as a viewer, you can't help feeling life might be better for each member of this family if they just went their separate ways. But, true to life, they stick together, in the face of continual betrayals, violence, angers, and destruction. And they keep a dark sense of humour throughout. As someone who has experienced the environment portrayed int his film, I found it highly realistic. The humour was twisted, but genuinely so - in times of such strife, gallows humour comes to the surface. And the continuing sense that the next crisis is only a lift ride away makes this movie forceful and unforgiving in it's portrayal of British street life.

    If you are heavily offended by the F or C word, or it's even taboo, forget about watching this film. Nil By Mouth is reality unfolding, before our very eyes. Ray Winstone gives a ferocious performance as a drug dealer ex parolee, also a heavy boozer, who likes to down a beer after a wine. Unfortunately his boozing leads to his habitual wife bashing. This time around it had devastating consequences. His long suffering wife, (Kathy Burke in a standout performance) has a heroin addict for brother, also an ex parolee (Charlie Creed Miles, who adds another A grade performance to this film). He's totally believable, especially in his desperation for another fix, mostly in scenes where he's having heated arguments with his mother (Oldman's real life sister). The montage song for this, I loved by the way. Nil by Mouth is not a plot driven movie. It's real life, and a kind of situation movie too. It's a movie based on Oldman's background, as a kid, growing up. Ray Winstone, who's got his career back on track after this 1998 film, has become one of my favorite actors. I'm glad he did too, as cinema has missed a movie great for far too long. The first half an hour has Winstone, and his best mate (Jamie Foreman) spinning gags and telling stories that you become involved with, one especially involving one of their mad crim mates. Even later on, after Winstone has gone berserk, tearing up his place, as if a buffalo charged through it, we have a scene with him spilling his sad childhood, about fatherly neglect onto his mate (Jamie Foreman), a patient and supportive listener, as shown in some other scenes as well, the kind of mate, everyone should have. The constant use of expletives, and I use constant with a capital C was true to fact from Oldman's perspective from what I heard. I've never heard a higher use of curses in film. At times the constant expletives become too much, but they're in those intense explosive scenes, Winstone's ones that work for it so darn well. E.g. like where he's trying to get his daughter back, causing a ruckus with other neighbors. You could see this happening anywhere. In life, we have our bad times and good times, one good time, clearly reflected in the last scene where everything's back on an evening keel, and Winstone's re-united with wife and daughter. It's cute, this scene with him, snuggling his daughter. These are moments you cherish and hold onto. It's one of the movie's best scenes. Another one is him, play fighting with his wife's mother, a tough steadfast oldie, who puts up her dukes. She doesn't have a bad singing voice to match, either, we discover. The other scene that's particularly impressive, is Winstone alone, liquored up, calling the wife. When he hangs up, he resumes a conversation, picking up his handset phone again, and banging it many times against it's receiver, while delivering an apologetic conversation, as if his wife (who's bashed face looks like a steamroller went over it) is there. This is followed by him defending himself, blaming the wife. This guy has really been torn in some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. We actually can't help feeling sorry for the guy, in spite of the consequences, prior to his violent acts, one murderous, which is most unforgiving. Winstone is one of those actors, like Ray Liotta, who can play rage and anger with brilliant believability, and also be threatening. Winstone's character is someone you wouldn't want get on their bad side, or meet in a dark alley. But it's Burke as the abused wife that rises above the other performances. That Kevin and Perry crap doesn't do her justice. The most effective NBM moment is near the start, during one of those stories, where Burke in the background, literally shakes for a couple of seconds while rigidly holding a coffee, as if the F words have become all too much, and too, this abuse has been going on for much too long. The bashing scene, where we see Ray's proud shirtless body, as he pounds on his wifee, who by the way is pregnant, will disturb some I imagine as it kind of did me, as he shouts the C word in a succession. One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia: Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand. Excellent, and in one sense, a sheer masterpiece, that MUST be viewed.

    'Nil By Mouth' is a potent, relentless dose of real life; a portrait of the dead-end cycle of violence, abuse, addiction and poverty that occurs in cities all over the world. Though a trifle convoluted (there are a few scenes that contribute little or nothing to the film), it is a genuinely moving, visceral experience. Don't be mistaken, this is not another trashy British gangster flick, far from it. Ray Winstone(Ray) and Kathy Burke (Valerie) are both tremendous, their performances stop the film from descending into the realm of 'The Football Factory' or 'Rise of the Footsoldier'. It's also the script that distinguishes it from such films which, on face value, appear comparable. The script has ample profanity, and I really mean ample, it's the most profane film I've ever seen, but it also has segments of real poignancy. Burke and Winstone interpreted the script perfectly. Winstone's performance is unsettlingly convincing; some may say he's one-dimensional, but he really is a rather good actor. It is Kathy Burke's moments that are the most moving, chiefly a scene where she desperately tells a white-lie: it's genuinely upsetting. The film is rightfully spared of romanticism, it's completely devoid of poetic licence, what you see is pure, candid realism. Ironically, the film isn't pure at all, it's gritty and unrestrained in its depiction of violence and vulgarity; one moment being particularly horrifying. To criticise the film for being 'unfocused' is missing the point. To me, it was an almost non- linear insight into the human condition, a film woven from the personal experiences of Gary Oldman and delivered with the utmost conviction from Burke, Winstone and indeed the whole cast.

    Nil By Mouth is not a film made for enjoyment - or even entertainment, for that matter. This is a raw, gritty insight into the very real world of alcoholism, abusive relationships, and general dysfunction. In his directorial debut, Gary Oldman makes no attempt to sugarcoat his perception of life in South London. Utilizing rough dialogue, claustrophobic camera work, grim lighting, and a constant presence of violent tension, he has instead created a cathartic and uncomfortably honest atmosphere from start to finish. The entire cast is pitch-perfect for what this film is trying to achieve- that being to divert from the typical Hollywood 'art imitating life' and into the real, unglamorous, and painful lives that thousands of people world-wide have to face every day. They are not in this film for their looks or reputation, but rather for their ability to capture what it is to be human in broken circumstances. They don't make practiced faces into the camera. They don't spew out Oscar-ready monologues. They don't shed the single, pretty tear down the cheek. No. They forget about the camera's presence and do exactly what you and I would do in their given situations, making them better actors than most A-Listers that you'll see today. Nil By Mouth is a thoroughly unpleasant 2 hour watch, and it will certainly be difficult to sit through. Never-the-less, it is a film that needs to be watched. While film is a great medium for escaping our daily hardships, it can also be used as a means of opening our eyes to the crueler side of life - the life of our neighbours, our friends, or even ourselves. Oldman has achieved this without mercy or restraint, and as a result has created a masterful study of every-day horrors.

    Gary Oldman's, Nil by Mouth (1997) is a gritty, dark, bleak and powerful movie with constant extremely strong language and unprecedented realism. The Movie nails 522 F-words (The most from any official motion picture film) The documentary on the F-word isn't classed as an official movie. And has more C-words than any other film with at least 82 (Maybe up to a hundred) So I strongly suggest AVOIDING this if you can't stand bad language and all emotional viewers should steer clear as the film can be tough to watch at times. The positives are huge though,which is why I rated this film (My 1st official IMDb Review) as a whopping 10/10. The acting is so believable and convincing. It makes you feel like you are watching a documentary somehow with that amazing realism in the atmosphere. It's so gripping to watch and will leave you in shock after watching thinking WOW! What a film. It has that impact. The film received 2 Bafta's and deserves It's awards because It's a corker. Gary Oldman: Excellent actor, writer & director. Ray Winstone's best performance (IMO) in any film by a long shot. And Kathy Burke was exceptional along with him. A real gem masterpiece. Take my word for it and watch it!

    It's always a fun experience to watch an actors shift to the director chair. Such is the story behind Nil by Mouth, the directorial debut of Gary Oldman, one of the finest actors working today. Oldman himself does not appear in the film, but a whole collection of fantastic actors do instead. The film is a brutal story of a dysfunctional family living in London. This distraught and detached family struggles to stay together, having to battle one brothers heroin addiction, anothers short temper and violent tendencies, as well as the general debauchery that occurs within the lives of these people. This isn't a pleasant film and it isn't a happy film. It's a brutal depiction of London working-class districts and it will certainly disturb you to your core. The brutality of Nil by Mouth is unheard of. The film is a non-stop stream of cursing, graphic drug uses, and despicable violence. The film never lets up on the atrocity, leaving you no time to catch your breath. It's a fast moving film; one that doesn't stop to explain things and doesn't spell everything out for you. It's a completely character driven story with more character development in it than actual events occurring. Yet, enough happens to make the film plenty interesting. It slows down towards the middle as it sets up for its somber ending that leaves you with a strange and uneasy feeling in your stomach. Now, I'm always up for a great character driven story, but you have to be prepared for a lot going into Nil by Mouth. The thing is, the characters in this film are not likable in the least. They are the most despicable, deplorable, horridly atrocious people you've ever laid eyes on. Apart from them being sleazy and unattractive, they all possess the most unflattering personalities. The film presents a very strange family dynamic, having the characters constantly switch between love and hate for one another. Billy, the brother with the terrible heroin addiction, has his own mother give him drug money and also provides him with a place to shoot up. This seems like the most brutal form of motherly love until the two scream at each other a scene later, throwing the most horrendous profanities at one another. It is indeed some of the strangest relationships you could ever observe, teetering on being farcical at times, yet being sincerely compelling at other times. Overall, it is hard to become attached to the characters in Nil by Mouth. They certainly tell a fascinatingly twisted story, but don't expect to find any sympathy left in your heart when it's all over. This film disturbs me more than entertains me, but that is obviously the point. It is so harrowing and so horrendous that I can't guarantee you will want to watch it again once it's over. I'm not sure that I do, but I don't regret watching it by any means. Gary Oldman needs to try his luck with directing again one of these days, because his first attempt has gone pretty well.

    Its very rare that I rate something 10 out of 10 but Nil By Mouth deserves it. What really really nags me is that this excellent film is poorly rated by Americans and Canadians etc that just don't get the lingo etc. Or the fact that Nil By Mouth is 'too grim' to applaud. I mean, had this been some less violent American movie by some A list actors then they would of gotten Oscar nominations and all sorts. The fact is this film is too real for most people. It has a lot of heart and reality to it. Its so gritty and raw and exploding with substance I cant believe how much Nil By Mouth is overlooked. AS far as I'm concerned this is the British Once Were Warriors, another great film but from New Zealand. I praise Gary Oldman for making such an honest, from the heart film. It is so rare nowadays to see something like Nil By Mouth. Kathy Burke is fantastic as the abused wife, and Ray Winstone equally as fantastic as the abuser and raging alcoholic. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. I really wish films like this existed today, sadly no one has the balls, vision or creativeness. Top film. If you think this film has no artistic merit then you really haven't got a clue. Its unique.

    ...and when I say reality,I mean just that. A universal reality. I've only been to London once for a concert and I stayed there for 3 days, so I'm not at all qualified to say that this is a slice of proletarian London life, and yet I felt the unequivocal and bland smell of real life right from the first frame.And that's because Gary Oldman manages to capture the universal drama of human life and emotion.He manages that through some really uninteresting dialog, some ordinary issues (poverty,macho-British style,hopelessness,addiction,abuse) and almost no cinematic thrills or gimmicks. The problem is that we are so used to those cinematic artifices that a movie like this one comes across as a flat line on a hospital machine. Not even when we have a climatic scene of Ray savagely beating his wife, I didn't feel terrified or like turning away in disgust because the by then the movie painstakingly tells the viewer that that's how it is and there is nothing to do about it, in other words, you're already emotionally numb and somehow not involved. Oldman considers this a semi-autobiographical movie. Add to that the way it is presented to us and it sheds some light as to why he's such a gifted, unconventional and unique actor, he clearly takes his energy, feelings and life experience from some unusual places. Absolutely shattering stuff.

    English actor Gary Oldman sunk $1.5 million of his own money into NIL BY MOUTH, a film he wrote and directed. It is an noncommercial film set in and around the London of his youth - a South London council estate where the sun never shines (these films always work best when shot in winter) and everything has a grey, washed out look to it. There's no real plot in NIL BY MOUTH. It focuses on villain Ray (Ray Winstone), his wife (Kathy Burke) and her brother (Charlie Creed Mills). The film often seems to consist of long scenes of people boozing, swearing and shooting up heroin. Much of the dialogue consists of the 'F' word used over and over again. Oldman does have an acute ear for discomforting dialogue (one character says of a woman he saw "getting a severe portion right up the f**king Gary") - it never sounds scripted and the whole film seems to happening spontaneously in front of the camera. Winstone delivers a career-best performance as the drunk Ray and Kathy Burke (who won the Best Actress prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for this role) wears an expression of down-trodden weariness on her face in every scene. When Ray beats her up in a drunken rage (she is pregnant at the time), it's a wince inducing scene complete with moans of pain from Burke. It's an astonishing moment that stays with you days, months, even years after you witness it. This is the underclass at its rawest and filmmaking at its rawest. It's grimness and imagery burns into your mind and once seen you'll find it difficult to shake or forget, a distinction it shares with Alan Clarke's SCUM - and Clarke was one of Oldman's stated influences when shooting the movie.

    I'm a sucker for Cockney films. I've got a few Cockney mates & I'm fascinated by their accent, slang & wit, but this is not Lock, Stock & Two Smoking, mate. Not even close. I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog. (English subtitles would have come in handy here.) But the very realism that makes this film so brilliant is what makes it so excruciating to watch. First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke. Nil by Mouth is about family  & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand  in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone  is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time. Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly  clearly still in a lot of pain  but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance. Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy  you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that  but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is. And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep. The ending is left open to interpretation. This isn't Hollywood; there never was a plot, nothing's neatly resolved, no comforting closure here. Is this a temporary truce or is it worse, a genuine rapprochement? It's impossible for the viewer to forgive Ray his brutality, and yet you're left with the sinking feeling that Val will & the cycle will go on.

One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia: Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand. Excellent, and in one sense, a sheer masterpiece, that MUST be viewed.

    'Nil By Mouth' is a potent, relentless dose of real life; a portrait of the dead-end cycle of violence, abuse, addiction and poverty that occurs in cities all over the world. Though a trifle convoluted (there are a few scenes that contribute little or nothing to the film), it is a genuinely moving, visceral experience. Don't be mistaken, this is not another trashy British gangster flick, far from it. Ray Winstone(Ray) and Kathy Burke (Valerie) are both tremendous, their performances stop the film from descending into the realm of 'The Football Factory' or 'Rise of the Footsoldier'. It's also the script that distinguishes it from such films which, on face value, appear comparable. The script has ample profanity, and I really mean ample, it's the most profane film I've ever seen, but it also has segments of real poignancy. Burke and Winstone interpreted the script perfectly. Winstone's performance is unsettlingly convincing; some may say he's one-dimensional, but he really is a rather good actor. It is Kathy Burke's moments that are the most moving, chiefly a scene where she desperately tells a white-lie: it's genuinely upsetting. The film is rightfully spared of romanticism, it's completely devoid of poetic licence, what you see is pure, candid realism. Ironically, the film isn't pure at all, it's gritty and unrestrained in its depiction of violence and vulgarity; one moment being particularly horrifying. To criticise the film for being 'unfocused' is missing the point. To me, it was an almost non- linear insight into the human condition, a film woven from the personal experiences of Gary Oldman and delivered with the utmost conviction from Burke, Winstone and indeed the whole cast.

    Nil By Mouth is not a film made for enjoyment - or even entertainment, for that matter. This is a raw, gritty insight into the very real world of alcoholism, abusive relationships, and general dysfunction. In his directorial debut, Gary Oldman makes no attempt to sugarcoat his perception of life in South London. Utilizing rough dialogue, claustrophobic camera work, grim lighting, and a constant presence of violent tension, he has instead created a cathartic and uncomfortably honest atmosphere from start to finish. The entire cast is pitch-perfect for what this film is trying to achieve- that being to divert from the typical Hollywood 'art imitating life' and into the real, unglamorous, and painful lives that thousands of people world-wide have to face every day. They are not in this film for their looks or reputation, but rather for their ability to capture what it is to be human in broken circumstances. They don't make practiced faces into the camera. They don't spew out Oscar-ready monologues. They don't shed the single, pretty tear down the cheek. No. They forget about the camera's presence and do exactly what you and I would do in their given situations, making them better actors than most A-Listers that you'll see today. Nil By Mouth is a thoroughly unpleasant 2 hour watch, and it will certainly be difficult to sit through. Never-the-less, it is a film that needs to be watched. While film is a great medium for escaping our daily hardships, it can also be used as a means of opening our eyes to the crueler side of life - the life of our neighbours, our friends, or even ourselves. Oldman has achieved this without mercy or restraint, and as a result has created a masterful study of every-day horrors.

    Gary Oldman's, Nil by Mouth (1997) is a gritty, dark, bleak and powerful movie with constant extremely strong language and unprecedented realism. The Movie nails 522 F-words (The most from any official motion picture film) The documentary on the F-word isn't classed as an official movie. And has more C-words than any other film with at least 82 (Maybe up to a hundred) So I strongly suggest AVOIDING this if you can't stand bad language and all emotional viewers should steer clear as the film can be tough to watch at times. The positives are huge though,which is why I rated this film (My 1st official IMDb Review) as a whopping 10/10. The acting is so believable and convincing. It makes you feel like you are watching a documentary somehow with that amazing realism in the atmosphere. It's so gripping to watch and will leave you in shock after watching thinking WOW! What a film. It has that impact. The film received 2 Bafta's and deserves It's awards because It's a corker. Gary Oldman: Excellent actor, writer & director. Ray Winstone's best performance (IMO) in any film by a long shot. And Kathy Burke was exceptional along with him. A real gem masterpiece. Take my word for it and watch it!

    It's always a fun experience to watch an actors shift to the director chair. Such is the story behind Nil by Mouth, the directorial debut of Gary Oldman, one of the finest actors working today. Oldman himself does not appear in the film, but a whole collection of fantastic actors do instead. The film is a brutal story of a dysfunctional family living in London. This distraught and detached family struggles to stay together, having to battle one brothers heroin addiction, anothers short temper and violent tendencies, as well as the general debauchery that occurs within the lives of these people. This isn't a pleasant film and it isn't a happy film. It's a brutal depiction of London working-class districts and it will certainly disturb you to your core. The brutality of Nil by Mouth is unheard of. The film is a non-stop stream of cursing, graphic drug uses, and despicable violence. The film never lets up on the atrocity, leaving you no time to catch your breath. It's a fast moving film; one that doesn't stop to explain things and doesn't spell everything out for you. It's a completely character driven story with more character development in it than actual events occurring. Yet, enough happens to make the film plenty interesting. It slows down towards the middle as it sets up for its somber ending that leaves you with a strange and uneasy feeling in your stomach. Now, I'm always up for a great character driven story, but you have to be prepared for a lot going into Nil by Mouth. The thing is, the characters in this film are not likable in the least. They are the most despicable, deplorable, horridly atrocious people you've ever laid eyes on. Apart from them being sleazy and unattractive, they all possess the most unflattering personalities. The film presents a very strange family dynamic, having the characters constantly switch between love and hate for one another. Billy, the brother with the terrible heroin addiction, has his own mother give him drug money and also provides him with a place to shoot up. This seems like the most brutal form of motherly love until the two scream at each other a scene later, throwing the most horrendous profanities at one another. It is indeed some of the strangest relationships you could ever observe, teetering on being farcical at times, yet being sincerely compelling at other times. Overall, it is hard to become attached to the characters in Nil by Mouth. They certainly tell a fascinatingly twisted story, but don't expect to find any sympathy left in your heart when it's all over. This film disturbs me more than entertains me, but that is obviously the point. It is so harrowing and so horrendous that I can't guarantee you will want to watch it again once it's over. I'm not sure that I do, but I don't regret watching it by any means. Gary Oldman needs to try his luck with directing again one of these days, because his first attempt has gone pretty well.

    Its very rare that I rate something 10 out of 10 but Nil By Mouth deserves it. What really really nags me is that this excellent film is poorly rated by Americans and Canadians etc that just don't get the lingo etc. Or the fact that Nil By Mouth is 'too grim' to applaud. I mean, had this been some less violent American movie by some A list actors then they would of gotten Oscar nominations and all sorts. The fact is this film is too real for most people. It has a lot of heart and reality to it. Its so gritty and raw and exploding with substance I cant believe how much Nil By Mouth is overlooked. AS far as I'm concerned this is the British Once Were Warriors, another great film but from New Zealand. I praise Gary Oldman for making such an honest, from the heart film. It is so rare nowadays to see something like Nil By Mouth. Kathy Burke is fantastic as the abused wife, and Ray Winstone equally as fantastic as the abuser and raging alcoholic. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. I really wish films like this existed today, sadly no one has the balls, vision or creativeness. Top film. If you think this film has no artistic merit then you really haven't got a clue. Its unique.

    ...and when I say reality,I mean just that. A universal reality. I've only been to London once for a concert and I stayed there for 3 days, so I'm not at all qualified to say that this is a slice of proletarian London life, and yet I felt the unequivocal and bland smell of real life right from the first frame.And that's because Gary Oldman manages to capture the universal drama of human life and emotion.He manages that through some really uninteresting dialog, some ordinary issues (poverty,macho-British style,hopelessness,addiction,abuse) and almost no cinematic thrills or gimmicks. The problem is that we are so used to those cinematic artifices that a movie like this one comes across as a flat line on a hospital machine. Not even when we have a climatic scene of Ray savagely beating his wife, I didn't feel terrified or like turning away in disgust because the by then the movie painstakingly tells the viewer that that's how it is and there is nothing to do about it, in other words, you're already emotionally numb and somehow not involved. Oldman considers this a semi-autobiographical movie. Add to that the way it is presented to us and it sheds some light as to why he's such a gifted, unconventional and unique actor, he clearly takes his energy, feelings and life experience from some unusual places. Absolutely shattering stuff.

    English actor Gary Oldman sunk $1.5 million of his own money into NIL BY MOUTH, a film he wrote and directed. It is an noncommercial film set in and around the London of his youth - a South London council estate where the sun never shines (these films always work best when shot in winter) and everything has a grey, washed out look to it. There's no real plot in NIL BY MOUTH. It focuses on villain Ray (Ray Winstone), his wife (Kathy Burke) and her brother (Charlie Creed Mills). The film often seems to consist of long scenes of people boozing, swearing and shooting up heroin. Much of the dialogue consists of the 'F' word used over and over again. Oldman does have an acute ear for discomforting dialogue (one character says of a woman he saw "getting a severe portion right up the f**king Gary") - it never sounds scripted and the whole film seems to happening spontaneously in front of the camera. Winstone delivers a career-best performance as the drunk Ray and Kathy Burke (who won the Best Actress prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for this role) wears an expression of down-trodden weariness on her face in every scene. When Ray beats her up in a drunken rage (she is pregnant at the time), it's a wince inducing scene complete with moans of pain from Burke. It's an astonishing moment that stays with you days, months, even years after you witness it. This is the underclass at its rawest and filmmaking at its rawest. It's grimness and imagery burns into your mind and once seen you'll find it difficult to shake or forget, a distinction it shares with Alan Clarke's SCUM - and Clarke was one of Oldman's stated influences when shooting the movie.

    I'm a sucker for Cockney films. I've got a few Cockney mates & I'm fascinated by their accent, slang & wit, but this is not Lock, Stock & Two Smoking, mate. Not even close. I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog. (English subtitles would have come in handy here.) But the very realism that makes this film so brilliant is what makes it so excruciating to watch. First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke. Nil by Mouth is about family  & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand  in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone  is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time. Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly  clearly still in a lot of pain  but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance. Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy  you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that  but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is. And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep. The ending is left open to interpretation. This isn't Hollywood; there never was a plot, nothing's neatly resolved, no comforting closure here. Is this a temporary truce or is it worse, a genuine rapprochement? It's impossible for the viewer to forgive Ray his brutality, and yet you're left with the sinking feeling that Val will & the cycle will go on.

    This is Gary Oldman's only directorial role. He is known for playing villains and difficult characters in a range of movies, and is known for having taken many "integrity roles" - not pandering to Hollywood-style movie star roles. His work as an actor is outstanding and suggests he loves theatre and film, and thinks seriously about the roles he accepts. So, his directorial debut should be judged by a high standard. Fortunately, it surpasses expectations. This is movie about working class London life. It is gritty, it is dark, it is heavy. It doesn't try to build up an idea of London Gangster, as other movies of this ilk seem prone to doing. There is no sense that the movie is an attempt to posture or create a "British ghetto cool" in response to American Gangster or Ghetto movies. It is unflinching in it's portrayal of housing estate life, heroin addiction, and families flawed on many levels. It doesn't romanticise any of this. But, despite the dark mood of the piece, and the coarseness of the characters involved, you do get a feeling that this family love each other and care about each other. Sometimes, this causes tension - as a viewer, you can't help feeling life might be better for each member of this family if they just went their separate ways. But, true to life, they stick together, in the face of continual betrayals, violence, angers, and destruction. And they keep a dark sense of humour throughout. As someone who has experienced the environment portrayed int his film, I found it highly realistic. The humour was twisted, but genuinely so - in times of such strife, gallows humour comes to the surface. And the continuing sense that the next crisis is only a lift ride away makes this movie forceful and unforgiving in it's portrayal of British street life.

    If you are heavily offended by the F or C word, or it's even taboo, forget about watching this film. Nil By Mouth is reality unfolding, before our very eyes. Ray Winstone gives a ferocious performance as a drug dealer ex parolee, also a heavy boozer, who likes to down a beer after a wine. Unfortunately his boozing leads to his habitual wife bashing. This time around it had devastating consequences. His long suffering wife, (Kathy Burke in a standout performance) has a heroin addict for brother, also an ex parolee (Charlie Creed Miles, who adds another A grade performance to this film). He's totally believable, especially in his desperation for another fix, mostly in scenes where he's having heated arguments with his mother (Oldman's real life sister). The montage song for this, I loved by the way. Nil by Mouth is not a plot driven movie. It's real life, and a kind of situation movie too. It's a movie based on Oldman's background, as a kid, growing up. Ray Winstone, who's got his career back on track after this 1998 film, has become one of my favorite actors. I'm glad he did too, as cinema has missed a movie great for far too long. The first half an hour has Winstone, and his best mate (Jamie Foreman) spinning gags and telling stories that you become involved with, one especially involving one of their mad crim mates. Even later on, after Winstone has gone berserk, tearing up his place, as if a buffalo charged through it, we have a scene with him spilling his sad childhood, about fatherly neglect onto his mate (Jamie Foreman), a patient and supportive listener, as shown in some other scenes as well, the kind of mate, everyone should have. The constant use of expletives, and I use constant with a capital C was true to fact from Oldman's perspective from what I heard. I've never heard a higher use of curses in film. At times the constant expletives become too much, but they're in those intense explosive scenes, Winstone's ones that work for it so darn well. E.g. like where he's trying to get his daughter back, causing a ruckus with other neighbors. You could see this happening anywhere. In life, we have our bad times and good times, one good time, clearly reflected in the last scene where everything's back on an evening keel, and Winstone's re-united with wife and daughter. It's cute, this scene with him, snuggling his daughter. These are moments you cherish and hold onto. It's one of the movie's best scenes. Another one is him, play fighting with his wife's mother, a tough steadfast oldie, who puts up her dukes. She doesn't have a bad singing voice to match, either, we discover. The other scene that's particularly impressive, is Winstone alone, liquored up, calling the wife. When he hangs up, he resumes a conversation, picking up his handset phone again, and banging it many times against it's receiver, while delivering an apologetic conversation, as if his wife (who's bashed face looks like a steamroller went over it) is there. This is followed by him defending himself, blaming the wife. This guy has really been torn in some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. We actually can't help feeling sorry for the guy, in spite of the consequences, prior to his violent acts, one murderous, which is most unforgiving. Winstone is one of those actors, like Ray Liotta, who can play rage and anger with brilliant believability, and also be threatening. Winstone's character is someone you wouldn't want get on their bad side, or meet in a dark alley. But it's Burke as the abused wife that rises above the other performances. That Kevin and Perry crap doesn't do her justice. The most effective NBM moment is near the start, during one of those stories, where Burke in the background, literally shakes for a couple of seconds while rigidly holding a coffee, as if the F words have become all too much, and too, this abuse has been going on for much too long. The bashing scene, where we see Ray's proud shirtless body, as he pounds on his wifee, who by the way is pregnant, will disturb some I imagine as it kind of did me, as he shouts the C word in a succession. One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia: Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand. Excellent, and in one sense, a sheer masterpiece, that MUST be viewed.

    It's always a fun experience to watch an actors shift to the director chair. Such is the story behind Nil by Mouth, the directorial debut of Gary Oldman, one of the finest actors working today. Oldman himself does not appear in the film, but a whole collection of fantastic actors do instead. The film is a brutal story of a dysfunctional family living in London. This distraught and detached family struggles to stay together, having to battle one brothers heroin addiction, anothers short temper and violent tendencies, as well as the general debauchery that occurs within the lives of these people. This isn't a pleasant film and it isn't a happy film. It's a brutal depiction of London working-class districts and it will certainly disturb you to your core. The brutality of Nil by Mouth is unheard of. The film is a non-stop stream of cursing, graphic drug uses, and despicable violence. The film never lets up on the atrocity, leaving you no time to catch your breath. It's a fast moving film; one that doesn't stop to explain things and doesn't spell everything out for you. It's a completely character driven story with more character development in it than actual events occurring. Yet, enough happens to make the film plenty interesting. It slows down towards the middle as it sets up for its somber ending that leaves you with a strange and uneasy feeling in your stomach. Now, I'm always up for a great character driven story, but you have to be prepared for a lot going into Nil by Mouth. The thing is, the characters in this film are not likable in the least. They are the most despicable, deplorable, horridly atrocious people you've ever laid eyes on. Apart from them being sleazy and unattractive, they all possess the most unflattering personalities. The film presents a very strange family dynamic, having the characters constantly switch between love and hate for one another. Billy, the brother with the terrible heroin addiction, has his own mother give him drug money and also provides him with a place to shoot up. This seems like the most brutal form of motherly love until the two scream at each other a scene later, throwing the most horrendous profanities at one another. It is indeed some of the strangest relationships you could ever observe, teetering on being farcical at times, yet being sincerely compelling at other times. Overall, it is hard to become attached to the characters in Nil by Mouth. They certainly tell a fascinatingly twisted story, but don't expect to find any sympathy left in your heart when it's all over. This film disturbs me more than entertains me, but that is obviously the point. It is so harrowing and so horrendous that I can't guarantee you will want to watch it again once it's over. I'm not sure that I do, but I don't regret watching it by any means. Gary Oldman needs to try his luck with directing again one of these days, because his first attempt has gone pretty well.

    Its very rare that I rate something 10 out of 10 but Nil By Mouth deserves it. What really really nags me is that this excellent film is poorly rated by Americans and Canadians etc that just don't get the lingo etc. Or the fact that Nil By Mouth is 'too grim' to applaud. I mean, had this been some less violent American movie by some A list actors then they would of gotten Oscar nominations and all sorts. The fact is this film is too real for most people. It has a lot of heart and reality to it. Its so gritty and raw and exploding with substance I cant believe how much Nil By Mouth is overlooked. AS far as I'm concerned this is the British Once Were Warriors, another great film but from New Zealand. I praise Gary Oldman for making such an honest, from the heart film. It is so rare nowadays to see something like Nil By Mouth. Kathy Burke is fantastic as the abused wife, and Ray Winstone equally as fantastic as the abuser and raging alcoholic. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. I really wish films like this existed today, sadly no one has the balls, vision or creativeness. Top film. If you think this film has no artistic merit then you really haven't got a clue. Its unique.

    ...and when I say reality,I mean just that. A universal reality. I've only been to London once for a concert and I stayed there for 3 days, so I'm not at all qualified to say that this is a slice of proletarian London life, and yet I felt the unequivocal and bland smell of real life right from the first frame.And that's because Gary Oldman manages to capture the universal drama of human life and emotion.He manages that through some really uninteresting dialog, some ordinary issues (poverty,macho-British style,hopelessness,addiction,abuse) and almost no cinematic thrills or gimmicks. The problem is that we are so used to those cinematic artifices that a movie like this one comes across as a flat line on a hospital machine. Not even when we have a climatic scene of Ray savagely beating his wife, I didn't feel terrified or like turning away in disgust because the by then the movie painstakingly tells the viewer that that's how it is and there is nothing to do about it, in other words, you're already emotionally numb and somehow not involved. Oldman considers this a semi-autobiographical movie. Add to that the way it is presented to us and it sheds some light as to why he's such a gifted, unconventional and unique actor, he clearly takes his energy, feelings and life experience from some unusual places. Absolutely shattering stuff.

    English actor Gary Oldman sunk $1.5 million of his own money into NIL BY MOUTH, a film he wrote and directed. It is an noncommercial film set in and around the London of his youth - a South London council estate where the sun never shines (these films always work best when shot in winter) and everything has a grey, washed out look to it. There's no real plot in NIL BY MOUTH. It focuses on villain Ray (Ray Winstone), his wife (Kathy Burke) and her brother (Charlie Creed Mills). The film often seems to consist of long scenes of people boozing, swearing and shooting up heroin. Much of the dialogue consists of the 'F' word used over and over again. Oldman does have an acute ear for discomforting dialogue (one character says of a woman he saw "getting a severe portion right up the f**king Gary") - it never sounds scripted and the whole film seems to happening spontaneously in front of the camera. Winstone delivers a career-best performance as the drunk Ray and Kathy Burke (who won the Best Actress prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for this role) wears an expression of down-trodden weariness on her face in every scene. When Ray beats her up in a drunken rage (she is pregnant at the time), it's a wince inducing scene complete with moans of pain from Burke. It's an astonishing moment that stays with you days, months, even years after you witness it. This is the underclass at its rawest and filmmaking at its rawest. It's grimness and imagery burns into your mind and once seen you'll find it difficult to shake or forget, a distinction it shares with Alan Clarke's SCUM - and Clarke was one of Oldman's stated influences when shooting the movie.

    I'm a sucker for Cockney films. I've got a few Cockney mates & I'm fascinated by their accent, slang & wit, but this is not Lock, Stock & Two Smoking, mate. Not even close. I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog. (English subtitles would have come in handy here.) But the very realism that makes this film so brilliant is what makes it so excruciating to watch. First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke. Nil by Mouth is about family  & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand  in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone  is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time. Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly  clearly still in a lot of pain  but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance. Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy  you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that  but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is. And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep. The ending is left open to interpretation. This isn't Hollywood; there never was a plot, nothing's neatly resolved, no comforting closure here. Is this a temporary truce or is it worse, a genuine rapprochement? It's impossible for the viewer to forgive Ray his brutality, and yet you're left with the sinking feeling that Val will & the cycle will go on.

    This is Gary Oldman's only directorial role. He is known for playing villains and difficult characters in a range of movies, and is known for having taken many "integrity roles" - not pandering to Hollywood-style movie star roles. His work as an actor is outstanding and suggests he loves theatre and film, and thinks seriously about the roles he accepts. So, his directorial debut should be judged by a high standard. Fortunately, it surpasses expectations. This is movie about working class London life. It is gritty, it is dark, it is heavy. It doesn't try to build up an idea of London Gangster, as other movies of this ilk seem prone to doing. There is no sense that the movie is an attempt to posture or create a "British ghetto cool" in response to American Gangster or Ghetto movies. It is unflinching in it's portrayal of housing estate life, heroin addiction, and families flawed on many levels. It doesn't romanticise any of this. But, despite the dark mood of the piece, and the coarseness of the characters involved, you do get a feeling that this family love each other and care about each other. Sometimes, this causes tension - as a viewer, you can't help feeling life might be better for each member of this family if they just went their separate ways. But, true to life, they stick together, in the face of continual betrayals, violence, angers, and destruction. And they keep a dark sense of humour throughout. As someone who has experienced the environment portrayed int his film, I found it highly realistic. The humour was twisted, but genuinely so - in times of such strife, gallows humour comes to the surface. And the continuing sense that the next crisis is only a lift ride away makes this movie forceful and unforgiving in it's portrayal of British street life.

    If you are heavily offended by the F or C word, or it's even taboo, forget about watching this film. Nil By Mouth is reality unfolding, before our very eyes. Ray Winstone gives a ferocious performance as a drug dealer ex parolee, also a heavy boozer, who likes to down a beer after a wine. Unfortunately his boozing leads to his habitual wife bashing. This time around it had devastating consequences. His long suffering wife, (Kathy Burke in a standout performance) has a heroin addict for brother, also an ex parolee (Charlie Creed Miles, who adds another A grade performance to this film). He's totally believable, especially in his desperation for another fix, mostly in scenes where he's having heated arguments with his mother (Oldman's real life sister). The montage song for this, I loved by the way. Nil by Mouth is not a plot driven movie. It's real life, and a kind of situation movie too. It's a movie based on Oldman's background, as a kid, growing up. Ray Winstone, who's got his career back on track after this 1998 film, has become one of my favorite actors. I'm glad he did too, as cinema has missed a movie great for far too long. The first half an hour has Winstone, and his best mate (Jamie Foreman) spinning gags and telling stories that you become involved with, one especially involving one of their mad crim mates. Even later on, after Winstone has gone berserk, tearing up his place, as if a buffalo charged through it, we have a scene with him spilling his sad childhood, about fatherly neglect onto his mate (Jamie Foreman), a patient and supportive listener, as shown in some other scenes as well, the kind of mate, everyone should have. The constant use of expletives, and I use constant with a capital C was true to fact from Oldman's perspective from what I heard. I've never heard a higher use of curses in film. At times the constant expletives become too much, but they're in those intense explosive scenes, Winstone's ones that work for it so darn well. E.g. like where he's trying to get his daughter back, causing a ruckus with other neighbors. You could see this happening anywhere. In life, we have our bad times and good times, one good time, clearly reflected in the last scene where everything's back on an evening keel, and Winstone's re-united with wife and daughter. It's cute, this scene with him, snuggling his daughter. These are moments you cherish and hold onto. It's one of the movie's best scenes. Another one is him, play fighting with his wife's mother, a tough steadfast oldie, who puts up her dukes. She doesn't have a bad singing voice to match, either, we discover. The other scene that's particularly impressive, is Winstone alone, liquored up, calling the wife. When he hangs up, he resumes a conversation, picking up his handset phone again, and banging it many times against it's receiver, while delivering an apologetic conversation, as if his wife (who's bashed face looks like a steamroller went over it) is there. This is followed by him defending himself, blaming the wife. This guy has really been torn in some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. We actually can't help feeling sorry for the guy, in spite of the consequences, prior to his violent acts, one murderous, which is most unforgiving. Winstone is one of those actors, like Ray Liotta, who can play rage and anger with brilliant believability, and also be threatening. Winstone's character is someone you wouldn't want get on their bad side, or meet in a dark alley. But it's Burke as the abused wife that rises above the other performances. That Kevin and Perry crap doesn't do her justice. The most effective NBM moment is near the start, during one of those stories, where Burke in the background, literally shakes for a couple of seconds while rigidly holding a coffee, as if the F words have become all too much, and too, this abuse has been going on for much too long. The bashing scene, where we see Ray's proud shirtless body, as he pounds on his wifee, who by the way is pregnant, will disturb some I imagine as it kind of did me, as he shouts the C word in a succession. One more scene I have to mention, cause I love it, is Charlie Creed Mile's friend, who looks Maori, his arm sporting all of this stuff, scrawled onto it, as if his arm's a blackboard. He recites that trademark Hopper scene in Apocalypse Now, in shouting form. Scenes like this are truly unforgettable. How Oldman got this project off the ground, in terms of script is an oddity. It's rough raw dialogue hardly leaves room for much else, although some of it, true to fact, hits you right in the nose. It's almost as if the actors ad-libbed. I would of loved to have read the written product. But there's no denying that this is a good movie, as it is an important one. Garry Oldman's only written and directed film. Funnily, Winstone went on to star in another controversial film, The War Zone, which was fine actor, Tim Roth's only directed film. Incidentally, some trivia: Nil By Mouth hit Adelaide cinemas, on May 21'st, Oldman's 40th birthday. Also the movie was brought back by public demand. Excellent, and in one sense, a sheer masterpiece, that MUST be viewed.

    'Nil By Mouth' is a potent, relentless dose of real life; a portrait of the dead-end cycle of violence, abuse, addiction and poverty that occurs in cities all over the world. Though a trifle convoluted (there are a few scenes that contribute little or nothing to the film), it is a genuinely moving, visceral experience. Don't be mistaken, this is not another trashy British gangster flick, far from it. Ray Winstone(Ray) and Kathy Burke (Valerie) are both tremendous, their performances stop the film from descending into the realm of 'The Football Factory' or 'Rise of the Footsoldier'. It's also the script that distinguishes it from such films which, on face value, appear comparable. The script has ample profanity, and I really mean ample, it's the most profane film I've ever seen, but it also has segments of real poignancy. Burke and Winstone interpreted the script perfectly. Winstone's performance is unsettlingly convincing; some may say he's one-dimensional, but he really is a rather good actor. It is Kathy Burke's moments that are the most moving, chiefly a scene where she desperately tells a white-lie: it's genuinely upsetting. The film is rightfully spared of romanticism, it's completely devoid of poetic licence, what you see is pure, candid realism. Ironically, the film isn't pure at all, it's gritty and unrestrained in its depiction of violence and vulgarity; one moment being particularly horrifying. To criticise the film for being 'unfocused' is missing the point. To me, it was an almost non- linear insight into the human condition, a film woven from the personal experiences of Gary Oldman and delivered with the utmost conviction from Burke, Winstone and indeed the whole cast.

    Nil By Mouth is not a film made for enjoyment - or even entertainment, for that matter. This is a raw, gritty insight into the very real world of alcoholism, abusive relationships, and general dysfunction. In his directorial debut, Gary Oldman makes no attempt to sugarcoat his perception of life in South London. Utilizing rough dialogue, claustrophobic camera work, grim lighting, and a constant presence of violent tension, he has instead created a cathartic and uncomfortably honest atmosphere from start to finish. The entire cast is pitch-perfect for what this film is trying to achieve- that being to divert from the typical Hollywood 'art imitating life' and into the real, unglamorous, and painful lives that thousands of people world-wide have to face every day. They are not in this film for their looks or reputation, but rather for their ability to capture what it is to be human in broken circumstances. They don't make practiced faces into the camera. They don't spew out Oscar-ready monologues. They don't shed the single, pretty tear down the cheek. No. They forget about the camera's presence and do exactly what you and I would do in their given situations, making them better actors than most A-Listers that you'll see today. Nil By Mouth is a thoroughly unpleasant 2 hour watch, and it will certainly be difficult to sit through. Never-the-less, it is a film that needs to be watched. While film is a great medium for escaping our daily hardships, it can also be used as a means of opening our eyes to the crueler side of life - the life of our neighbours, our friends, or even ourselves. Oldman has achieved this without mercy or restraint, and as a result has created a masterful study of every-day horrors.

    Gary Oldman's, Nil by Mouth (1997) is a gritty, dark, bleak and powerful movie with constant extremely strong language and unprecedented realism. The Movie nails 522 F-words (The most from any official motion picture film) The documentary on the F-word isn't classed as an official movie. And has more C-words than any other film with at least 82 (Maybe up to a hundred) So I strongly suggest AVOIDING this if you can't stand bad language and all emotional viewers should steer clear as the film can be tough to watch at times. The positives are huge though,which is why I rated this film (My 1st official IMDb Review) as a whopping 10/10. The acting is so believable and convincing. It makes you feel like you are watching a documentary somehow with that amazing realism in the atmosphere. It's so gripping to watch and will leave you in shock after watching thinking WOW! What a film. It has that impact. The film received 2 Bafta's and deserves It's awards because It's a corker. Gary Oldman: Excellent actor, writer & director. Ray Winstone's best performance (IMO) in any film by a long shot. And Kathy Burke was exceptional along with him. A real gem masterpiece. Take my word for it and watch it!

Add to that the way it is presented to us and it sheds some light as to why he's such a gifted, unconventional and unique actor, he clearly takes his energy, feelings and life experience from some unusual places. Absolutely shattering stuff.

    English actor Gary Oldman sunk $1.5 million of his own money into NIL BY MOUTH, a film he wrote and directed. It is an noncommercial film set in and around the London of his youth - a South London council estate where the sun never shines (these films always work best when shot in winter) and everything has a grey, washed out look to it. There's no real plot in NIL BY MOUTH. It focuses on villain Ray (Ray Winstone), his wife (Kathy Burke) and her brother (Charlie Creed Mills). The film often seems to consist of long scenes of people boozing, swearing and shooting up heroin. Much of the dialogue consists of the 'F' word used over and over again. Oldman does have an acute ear for discomforting dialogue (one character says of a woman he saw "getting a severe portion right up the f**king Gary") - it never sounds scripted and the whole film seems to happening spontaneously in front of the camera. Winstone delivers a career-best performance as the drunk Ray and Kathy Burke (who won the Best Actress prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for this role) wears an expression of down-trodden weariness on her face in every scene. When Ray beats her up in a drunken rage (she is pregnant at the time), it's a wince inducing scene complete with moans of pain from Burke. It's an astonishing moment that stays with you days, months, even years after you witness it. This is the underclass at its rawest and filmmaking at its rawest. It's grimness and imagery burns into your mind and once seen you'll find it difficult to shake or forget, a distinction it shares with Alan Clarke's SCUM - and Clarke was one of Oldman's stated influences when shooting the movie.

    I'm a sucker for Cockney films. I've got a few Cockney mates & I'm fascinated by their accent, slang & wit, but this is not Lock, Stock & Two Smoking, mate. Not even close. I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog. (English subtitles would have come in handy here.) But the very realism that makes this film so brilliant is what makes it so excruciating to watch. First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke. Nil by Mouth is about family  & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand  in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone  is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time. Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly  clearly still in a lot of pain  but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance. Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy  you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that  but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is. And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep. The ending is left open to interpretation. This isn't Hollywood; there never was a plot, nothing's neatly resolved, no comforting closure here. Is this a temporary truce or is it worse, a genuine rapprochement? It's impossible for the viewer to forgive Ray his brutality, and yet you're left with the sinking feeling that Val will & the cycle will go on.

    This is Gary Oldman's only directorial role. He is known for playing villains and difficult characters in a range of movies, and is known for having taken many "integrity roles" - not pandering to Hollywood-style movie star roles. His work as an actor is outstanding and suggests he loves theatre and film, and thinks seriously about the roles he accepts. So, his directorial debut should be judged by a high standard. Fortunately, it surpasses expectations. This is movie about working class London life. It is gritty, it is dark, it is heavy. It doesn't try to build up an idea of London Gangster, as other movies of this ilk seem prone to doing. There is no sense that the movie is an attempt to posture or create a "British ghetto cool" in response to American Gangster or Ghetto movies. It is unflinching in it's portrayal of housing estate life, heroin addiction, and families flawed on many levels. It doesn't romanticise any of this. But, despite the dark mood of the piece, and the coarseness of the characters involved, you do get a feeling that this family love each other and care about each other. Sometimes, this causes tension - as a viewer, you can't help feeling life might be better for each member of this family if they just went their separate ways. But, true to life, they stick together, in the face of continual betrayals, violence, angers, and destruction. And they keep a dark sense of humour throughout. As someone who has experienced the environment portrayed int his film, I found it highly realistic. The humour was twisted, but genuinely so - in times of such strife, gallows humour comes to the surface. And the continuing sense that the next crisis is only a lift ride away makes this movie forceful and unforgiving in it's portrayal of British street life.
