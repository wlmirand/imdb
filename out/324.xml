    This movie is very weird, like any other Lynch movie. But the story is quite interesting and the characters are intriguing and not dull. What I didn't like was some use of the metaphors in the movie which I didn't understand until I read the explanation of the movie on the internet. Pullmans performance is very good and Arquettes a fine add to the movie. Also the thing I liked very much was the soundtrack which suits the movie perfectly. The movie length is just about right. I was surprised by the role of Robert Blake but it seemed he managed it quite good. All in all, a decent movie with complicated story, a solid seven out of ten from me.

    This was the first film which made me say 'What the hell am I watching?' Ever since watching Inception (a masterpiece), I got interested in watching confusing movies. So I Googled 'The most confusing movies ever'. In one of the results this film was ranked 3rd with the photo of that bloody mystery man with a camera in his hand. I was naturally interested. They even gave a synopsis of this movie. I got even more interested and finally I bought a CD. Really, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE MOVIE ABOUT? First they show a husband and wife living a happy life. Then they start receiving mystery tapes that shows their house and they get a bit worried. They call the cops, but to hell with the cops. They don't seem to have an idea. Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends. Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit. If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this. They would really really really feel excruciating pain.

    As of late, a great fan of David Lynch, I finally got round to watching Lost Highway. I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status. If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it. The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte "Everything we see hides another thing". Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being "Mulholland Drive  2001" and the third "Inland Empire  2006". One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who "forgot" to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge!

    One of the worst films I have ever struggled to sit through. I didn't know who the director was when I sat for this viewing, nor had ever heard of the film. I saw Bill Pullman and a few other names so gave it a try. This was a total bomb, as evidenced at the box office. Right off, one could tell the director was trying very hard for an obvious artsy appeal and lost big time. $15 million was wasted on this project and director. When I think of all the good stories and entertainment that struggled to get funding and something like this makes it to the screen, it makes me very disappointed in Hollywood. A very sad and ridiculous film.

    "Lost Highway" is a little like trying to watch television while someone in another room constantly changes the channel with the remote control. One theory, amongst many, contends that the movie replicates the feeling of schizophrenia. Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place &agrave; la the psychiatrist in "Psycho", but "Lost Highway" is particularly challenging as regards explanation. Another commentator thinks that "Lost Highway" is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie  circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie. A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes. Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping  they call the police. At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him. A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end. By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense  maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea  and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; "Lost Highway" is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around.

    First of all, I would like to draw a paradigm between this movie and a painter who buys a 20 square meter canvas and paints a dot in the middle of it. So then he cr.ps about the instability and inconsistency of the universe and how he sees it through that dot. Not going to happen... This movie is weird, but not in a good way like "A Clockwork Orange" or Tarantino (Orange came to my mind because of the interior of the house, as Lynch tried to replicate the effect of the stage in Cubrick's movie. All I can say is NO WAY!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A PALE, BAD COPY...). The weirdness in "Lost Highway" comes from Lynch's radical misconception of understanding of human mind. But some people obviously love that. Some people love to think about themselves as weird and mystic and alternative. And that's where good grades come from. You don't understand it, but it's weird, so it's cool. Now back to the "mentalpiece". Things like those happened to the leading character just do not happen in the real or slightly surreal life. Little crazy masterminds do not exist. A club sax player with a 1 million $ house also does not exist. A situation when you kill someone and don't remember... Guess! Ain't gonna happen. If the director tried to make some metaphors to something, well, he failed. If this was a try of presenting human character, it failed. If there was a grade below one, well, this is an ultimate candidate for it. Now, I would rather spend the time to pull my toenails or listen to Paris Hilton's music, than to watch this movie again. My country was at war some 14 years ago and, trust me, it was nothing compared to this movie...

    My summary above was somewhat harsh, but Patricia Arquette's performance is one of the things i remembered most vividly about Lost Highway. The movie follows a non-linear narrative which is almost a standard today but has been a minor revolution at the time of it's creation. It is seldom that the crime underworld has been brought on screen in such a surrealist environment. Author's intent to lead the story nowhere is either well hidden or the producers held him on a tight leash. This hasn't been as successful in David Lynch's later work, but i think he's producing his own movies now. A large portion of my vote, however, goes for the scenes with scantily clad Patricia Arquette...

    As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music. So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places. Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home. Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelg&auml;nger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up. As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become. This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride. Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyonc&eacute; woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it. As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "f&uuml;cking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

    lost highway is not as puzzling as it might first appear. it's actually an old fashioned faustian drama adapted for a modern, lynchian age. it is also, likely the most advanced and fun film of our era; at least stylistically. fred has made a pact with the devil to be a great jazz musician - as the always scary robert blake says: you invited me into your home, it is not my business to go where i am not invited. the price fred must pay is his soul, and everything else during his time on earth.the devil, as is the literary tradition, finds this enormously amusing and enjoys toying with fred, and directs him to kill his wife. fred has no idea what is going on, because he is just a mortal pawn in a much larger game. he pays by being arrested and going to the chair. as he fries, he lives out his fantasty, the fantasy he thought he was bargaining for with the devil - his alter ego, pete - young, smooth, and a winner with the girls. but the fantasy is just that. we cannot escape our destiny, and in the end, fred/pete cannot hold true as the devil is in control, and the devil is coming to collect... hence, lost highway.

    For many people, I imagine, David Lynch's films are love them or hate them affairs. But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the "popular" statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything? The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible. Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams. Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film. However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans. Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story. With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean. Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.

    One of the worst films I have ever struggled to sit through. I didn't know who the director was when I sat for this viewing, nor had ever heard of the film. I saw Bill Pullman and a few other names so gave it a try. This was a total bomb, as evidenced at the box office. Right off, one could tell the director was trying very hard for an obvious artsy appeal and lost big time. $15 million was wasted on this project and director. When I think of all the good stories and entertainment that struggled to get funding and something like this makes it to the screen, it makes me very disappointed in Hollywood. A very sad and ridiculous film.

    "Lost Highway" is a little like trying to watch television while someone in another room constantly changes the channel with the remote control. One theory, amongst many, contends that the movie replicates the feeling of schizophrenia. Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place &agrave; la the psychiatrist in "Psycho", but "Lost Highway" is particularly challenging as regards explanation. Another commentator thinks that "Lost Highway" is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie  circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie. A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes. Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping  they call the police. At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him. A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end. By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense  maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea  and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; "Lost Highway" is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around.

    First of all, I would like to draw a paradigm between this movie and a painter who buys a 20 square meter canvas and paints a dot in the middle of it. So then he cr.ps about the instability and inconsistency of the universe and how he sees it through that dot. Not going to happen... This movie is weird, but not in a good way like "A Clockwork Orange" or Tarantino (Orange came to my mind because of the interior of the house, as Lynch tried to replicate the effect of the stage in Cubrick's movie. All I can say is NO WAY!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A PALE, BAD COPY...). The weirdness in "Lost Highway" comes from Lynch's radical misconception of understanding of human mind. But some people obviously love that. Some people love to think about themselves as weird and mystic and alternative. And that's where good grades come from. You don't understand it, but it's weird, so it's cool. Now back to the "mentalpiece". Things like those happened to the leading character just do not happen in the real or slightly surreal life. Little crazy masterminds do not exist. A club sax player with a 1 million $ house also does not exist. A situation when you kill someone and don't remember... Guess! Ain't gonna happen. If the director tried to make some metaphors to something, well, he failed. If this was a try of presenting human character, it failed. If there was a grade below one, well, this is an ultimate candidate for it. Now, I would rather spend the time to pull my toenails or listen to Paris Hilton's music, than to watch this movie again. My country was at war some 14 years ago and, trust me, it was nothing compared to this movie...

    My summary above was somewhat harsh, but Patricia Arquette's performance is one of the things i remembered most vividly about Lost Highway. The movie follows a non-linear narrative which is almost a standard today but has been a minor revolution at the time of it's creation. It is seldom that the crime underworld has been brought on screen in such a surrealist environment. Author's intent to lead the story nowhere is either well hidden or the producers held him on a tight leash. This hasn't been as successful in David Lynch's later work, but i think he's producing his own movies now. A large portion of my vote, however, goes for the scenes with scantily clad Patricia Arquette...

    As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music. So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places. Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home. Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelg&auml;nger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up. As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become. This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride. Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyonc&eacute; woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it. As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "f&uuml;cking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

    lost highway is not as puzzling as it might first appear. it's actually an old fashioned faustian drama adapted for a modern, lynchian age. it is also, likely the most advanced and fun film of our era; at least stylistically. fred has made a pact with the devil to be a great jazz musician - as the always scary robert blake says: you invited me into your home, it is not my business to go where i am not invited. the price fred must pay is his soul, and everything else during his time on earth.the devil, as is the literary tradition, finds this enormously amusing and enjoys toying with fred, and directs him to kill his wife. fred has no idea what is going on, because he is just a mortal pawn in a much larger game. he pays by being arrested and going to the chair. as he fries, he lives out his fantasty, the fantasy he thought he was bargaining for with the devil - his alter ego, pete - young, smooth, and a winner with the girls. but the fantasy is just that. we cannot escape our destiny, and in the end, fred/pete cannot hold true as the devil is in control, and the devil is coming to collect... hence, lost highway.

    For many people, I imagine, David Lynch's films are love them or hate them affairs. But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the "popular" statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything? The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible. Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams. Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film. However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans. Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story. With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean. Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.

    This movie is very weird, like any other Lynch movie. But the story is quite interesting and the characters are intriguing and not dull. What I didn't like was some use of the metaphors in the movie which I didn't understand until I read the explanation of the movie on the internet. Pullmans performance is very good and Arquettes a fine add to the movie. Also the thing I liked very much was the soundtrack which suits the movie perfectly. The movie length is just about right. I was surprised by the role of Robert Blake but it seemed he managed it quite good. All in all, a decent movie with complicated story, a solid seven out of ten from me.

    This was the first film which made me say 'What the hell am I watching?' Ever since watching Inception (a masterpiece), I got interested in watching confusing movies. So I Googled 'The most confusing movies ever'. In one of the results this film was ranked 3rd with the photo of that bloody mystery man with a camera in his hand. I was naturally interested. They even gave a synopsis of this movie. I got even more interested and finally I bought a CD. Really, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE MOVIE ABOUT? First they show a husband and wife living a happy life. Then they start receiving mystery tapes that shows their house and they get a bit worried. They call the cops, but to hell with the cops. They don't seem to have an idea. Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends. Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit. If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this. They would really really really feel excruciating pain.

    As of late, a great fan of David Lynch, I finally got round to watching Lost Highway. I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status. If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it. The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte "Everything we see hides another thing". Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being "Mulholland Drive  2001" and the third "Inland Empire  2006". One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who "forgot" to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge!

    As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music. So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places. Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home. Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelg&auml;nger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up. As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become. This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride. Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyonc&eacute; woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it. As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "f&uuml;cking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

    lost highway is not as puzzling as it might first appear. it's actually an old fashioned faustian drama adapted for a modern, lynchian age. it is also, likely the most advanced and fun film of our era; at least stylistically. fred has made a pact with the devil to be a great jazz musician - as the always scary robert blake says: you invited me into your home, it is not my business to go where i am not invited. the price fred must pay is his soul, and everything else during his time on earth.the devil, as is the literary tradition, finds this enormously amusing and enjoys toying with fred, and directs him to kill his wife. fred has no idea what is going on, because he is just a mortal pawn in a much larger game. he pays by being arrested and going to the chair. as he fries, he lives out his fantasty, the fantasy he thought he was bargaining for with the devil - his alter ego, pete - young, smooth, and a winner with the girls. but the fantasy is just that. we cannot escape our destiny, and in the end, fred/pete cannot hold true as the devil is in control, and the devil is coming to collect... hence, lost highway.

    For many people, I imagine, David Lynch's films are love them or hate them affairs. But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the "popular" statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything? The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible. Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams. Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film. However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans. Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story. With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean. Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.

    This movie is very weird, like any other Lynch movie. But the story is quite interesting and the characters are intriguing and not dull. What I didn't like was some use of the metaphors in the movie which I didn't understand until I read the explanation of the movie on the internet. Pullmans performance is very good and Arquettes a fine add to the movie. Also the thing I liked very much was the soundtrack which suits the movie perfectly. The movie length is just about right. I was surprised by the role of Robert Blake but it seemed he managed it quite good. All in all, a decent movie with complicated story, a solid seven out of ten from me.

    This was the first film which made me say 'What the hell am I watching?' Ever since watching Inception (a masterpiece), I got interested in watching confusing movies. So I Googled 'The most confusing movies ever'. In one of the results this film was ranked 3rd with the photo of that bloody mystery man with a camera in his hand. I was naturally interested. They even gave a synopsis of this movie. I got even more interested and finally I bought a CD. Really, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE MOVIE ABOUT? First they show a husband and wife living a happy life. Then they start receiving mystery tapes that shows their house and they get a bit worried. They call the cops, but to hell with the cops. They don't seem to have an idea. Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends. Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit. If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this. They would really really really feel excruciating pain.

    As of late, a great fan of David Lynch, I finally got round to watching Lost Highway. I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status. If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it. The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte "Everything we see hides another thing". Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being "Mulholland Drive  2001" and the third "Inland Empire  2006". One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who "forgot" to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge!

    One of the worst films I have ever struggled to sit through. I didn't know who the director was when I sat for this viewing, nor had ever heard of the film. I saw Bill Pullman and a few other names so gave it a try. This was a total bomb, as evidenced at the box office. Right off, one could tell the director was trying very hard for an obvious artsy appeal and lost big time. $15 million was wasted on this project and director. When I think of all the good stories and entertainment that struggled to get funding and something like this makes it to the screen, it makes me very disappointed in Hollywood. A very sad and ridiculous film.

    "Lost Highway" is a little like trying to watch television while someone in another room constantly changes the channel with the remote control. One theory, amongst many, contends that the movie replicates the feeling of schizophrenia. Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place &agrave; la the psychiatrist in "Psycho", but "Lost Highway" is particularly challenging as regards explanation. Another commentator thinks that "Lost Highway" is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie  circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie. A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes. Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping  they call the police. At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him. A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end. By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense  maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea  and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; "Lost Highway" is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around.

    First of all, I would like to draw a paradigm between this movie and a painter who buys a 20 square meter canvas and paints a dot in the middle of it. So then he cr.ps about the instability and inconsistency of the universe and how he sees it through that dot. Not going to happen... This movie is weird, but not in a good way like "A Clockwork Orange" or Tarantino (Orange came to my mind because of the interior of the house, as Lynch tried to replicate the effect of the stage in Cubrick's movie. All I can say is NO WAY!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A PALE, BAD COPY...). The weirdness in "Lost Highway" comes from Lynch's radical misconception of understanding of human mind. But some people obviously love that. Some people love to think about themselves as weird and mystic and alternative. And that's where good grades come from. You don't understand it, but it's weird, so it's cool. Now back to the "mentalpiece". Things like those happened to the leading character just do not happen in the real or slightly surreal life. Little crazy masterminds do not exist. A club sax player with a 1 million $ house also does not exist. A situation when you kill someone and don't remember... Guess! Ain't gonna happen. If the director tried to make some metaphors to something, well, he failed. If this was a try of presenting human character, it failed. If there was a grade below one, well, this is an ultimate candidate for it. Now, I would rather spend the time to pull my toenails or listen to Paris Hilton's music, than to watch this movie again. My country was at war some 14 years ago and, trust me, it was nothing compared to this movie...

    My summary above was somewhat harsh, but Patricia Arquette's performance is one of the things i remembered most vividly about Lost Highway. The movie follows a non-linear narrative which is almost a standard today but has been a minor revolution at the time of it's creation. It is seldom that the crime underworld has been brought on screen in such a surrealist environment. Author's intent to lead the story nowhere is either well hidden or the producers held him on a tight leash. This hasn't been as successful in David Lynch's later work, but i think he's producing his own movies now. A large portion of my vote, however, goes for the scenes with scantily clad Patricia Arquette...

Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything? The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible. Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams. Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film. However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans. Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story. With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean. Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.

    This movie is very weird, like any other Lynch movie. But the story is quite interesting and the characters are intriguing and not dull. What I didn't like was some use of the metaphors in the movie which I didn't understand until I read the explanation of the movie on the internet. Pullmans performance is very good and Arquettes a fine add to the movie. Also the thing I liked very much was the soundtrack which suits the movie perfectly. The movie length is just about right. I was surprised by the role of Robert Blake but it seemed he managed it quite good. All in all, a decent movie with complicated story, a solid seven out of ten from me.

    This was the first film which made me say 'What the hell am I watching?' Ever since watching Inception (a masterpiece), I got interested in watching confusing movies. So I Googled 'The most confusing movies ever'. In one of the results this film was ranked 3rd with the photo of that bloody mystery man with a camera in his hand. I was naturally interested. They even gave a synopsis of this movie. I got even more interested and finally I bought a CD. Really, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE MOVIE ABOUT? First they show a husband and wife living a happy life. Then they start receiving mystery tapes that shows their house and they get a bit worried. They call the cops, but to hell with the cops. They don't seem to have an idea. Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends. Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit. If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this. They would really really really feel excruciating pain.

    As of late, a great fan of David Lynch, I finally got round to watching Lost Highway. I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status. If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it. The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte "Everything we see hides another thing". Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being "Mulholland Drive  2001" and the third "Inland Empire  2006". One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who "forgot" to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge!

    One of the worst films I have ever struggled to sit through. I didn't know who the director was when I sat for this viewing, nor had ever heard of the film. I saw Bill Pullman and a few other names so gave it a try. This was a total bomb, as evidenced at the box office. Right off, one could tell the director was trying very hard for an obvious artsy appeal and lost big time. $15 million was wasted on this project and director. When I think of all the good stories and entertainment that struggled to get funding and something like this makes it to the screen, it makes me very disappointed in Hollywood. A very sad and ridiculous film.

    "Lost Highway" is a little like trying to watch television while someone in another room constantly changes the channel with the remote control. One theory, amongst many, contends that the movie replicates the feeling of schizophrenia. Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place &agrave; la the psychiatrist in "Psycho", but "Lost Highway" is particularly challenging as regards explanation. Another commentator thinks that "Lost Highway" is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie  circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie. A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes. Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping  they call the police. At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him. A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end. By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense  maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea  and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; "Lost Highway" is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around.

    First of all, I would like to draw a paradigm between this movie and a painter who buys a 20 square meter canvas and paints a dot in the middle of it. So then he cr.ps about the instability and inconsistency of the universe and how he sees it through that dot. Not going to happen... This movie is weird, but not in a good way like "A Clockwork Orange" or Tarantino (Orange came to my mind because of the interior of the house, as Lynch tried to replicate the effect of the stage in Cubrick's movie. All I can say is NO WAY!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A PALE, BAD COPY...). The weirdness in "Lost Highway" comes from Lynch's radical misconception of understanding of human mind. But some people obviously love that. Some people love to think about themselves as weird and mystic and alternative. And that's where good grades come from. You don't understand it, but it's weird, so it's cool. Now back to the "mentalpiece". Things like those happened to the leading character just do not happen in the real or slightly surreal life. Little crazy masterminds do not exist. A club sax player with a 1 million $ house also does not exist. A situation when you kill someone and don't remember... Guess! Ain't gonna happen. If the director tried to make some metaphors to something, well, he failed. If this was a try of presenting human character, it failed. If there was a grade below one, well, this is an ultimate candidate for it. Now, I would rather spend the time to pull my toenails or listen to Paris Hilton's music, than to watch this movie again. My country was at war some 14 years ago and, trust me, it was nothing compared to this movie...

    My summary above was somewhat harsh, but Patricia Arquette's performance is one of the things i remembered most vividly about Lost Highway. The movie follows a non-linear narrative which is almost a standard today but has been a minor revolution at the time of it's creation. It is seldom that the crime underworld has been brought on screen in such a surrealist environment. Author's intent to lead the story nowhere is either well hidden or the producers held him on a tight leash. This hasn't been as successful in David Lynch's later work, but i think he's producing his own movies now. A large portion of my vote, however, goes for the scenes with scantily clad Patricia Arquette...

    As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music. So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places. Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home. Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelg&auml;nger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up. As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become. This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride. Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyonc&eacute; woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it. As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "f&uuml;cking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

    lost highway is not as puzzling as it might first appear. it's actually an old fashioned faustian drama adapted for a modern, lynchian age. it is also, likely the most advanced and fun film of our era; at least stylistically. fred has made a pact with the devil to be a great jazz musician - as the always scary robert blake says: you invited me into your home, it is not my business to go where i am not invited. the price fred must pay is his soul, and everything else during his time on earth.the devil, as is the literary tradition, finds this enormously amusing and enjoys toying with fred, and directs him to kill his wife. fred has no idea what is going on, because he is just a mortal pawn in a much larger game. he pays by being arrested and going to the chair. as he fries, he lives out his fantasty, the fantasy he thought he was bargaining for with the devil - his alter ego, pete - young, smooth, and a winner with the girls. but the fantasy is just that. we cannot escape our destiny, and in the end, fred/pete cannot hold true as the devil is in control, and the devil is coming to collect... hence, lost highway.

    For many people, I imagine, David Lynch's films are love them or hate them affairs. But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the "popular" statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything? The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible. Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams.

The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends. Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit. If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this. They would really really really feel excruciating pain.

    As of late, a great fan of David Lynch, I finally got round to watching Lost Highway. I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status. If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it. The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte "Everything we see hides another thing". Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being "Mulholland Drive  2001" and the third "Inland Empire  2006". One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who "forgot" to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge!

    One of the worst films I have ever struggled to sit through. I didn't know who the director was when I sat for this viewing, nor had ever heard of the film. I saw Bill Pullman and a few other names so gave it a try. This was a total bomb, as evidenced at the box office. Right off, one could tell the director was trying very hard for an obvious artsy appeal and lost big time. $15 million was wasted on this project and director. When I think of all the good stories and entertainment that struggled to get funding and something like this makes it to the screen, it makes me very disappointed in Hollywood. A very sad and ridiculous film.

    "Lost Highway" is a little like trying to watch television while someone in another room constantly changes the channel with the remote control. One theory, amongst many, contends that the movie replicates the feeling of schizophrenia. Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place &agrave; la the psychiatrist in "Psycho", but "Lost Highway" is particularly challenging as regards explanation. Another commentator thinks that "Lost Highway" is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie  circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie. A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes. Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping  they call the police. At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him. A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end. By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense  maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea  and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; "Lost Highway" is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around.

    First of all, I would like to draw a paradigm between this movie and a painter who buys a 20 square meter canvas and paints a dot in the middle of it. So then he cr.ps about the instability and inconsistency of the universe and how he sees it through that dot. Not going to happen... This movie is weird, but not in a good way like "A Clockwork Orange" or Tarantino (Orange came to my mind because of the interior of the house, as Lynch tried to replicate the effect of the stage in Cubrick's movie. All I can say is NO WAY!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A PALE, BAD COPY...). The weirdness in "Lost Highway" comes from Lynch's radical misconception of understanding of human mind. But some people obviously love that. Some people love to think about themselves as weird and mystic and alternative. And that's where good grades come from. You don't understand it, but it's weird, so it's cool. Now back to the "mentalpiece". Things like those happened to the leading character just do not happen in the real or slightly surreal life. Little crazy masterminds do not exist. A club sax player with a 1 million $ house also does not exist. A situation when you kill someone and don't remember... Guess! Ain't gonna happen. If the director tried to make some metaphors to something, well, he failed. If this was a try of presenting human character, it failed. If there was a grade below one, well, this is an ultimate candidate for it. Now, I would rather spend the time to pull my toenails or listen to Paris Hilton's music, than to watch this movie again. My country was at war some 14 years ago and, trust me, it was nothing compared to this movie...

    My summary above was somewhat harsh, but Patricia Arquette's performance is one of the things i remembered most vividly about Lost Highway. The movie follows a non-linear narrative which is almost a standard today but has been a minor revolution at the time of it's creation. It is seldom that the crime underworld has been brought on screen in such a surrealist environment. Author's intent to lead the story nowhere is either well hidden or the producers held him on a tight leash. This hasn't been as successful in David Lynch's later work, but i think he's producing his own movies now. A large portion of my vote, however, goes for the scenes with scantily clad Patricia Arquette...

    As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music. So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places. Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home. Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelg&auml;nger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up. As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become. This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride. Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyonc&eacute; woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it. As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "f&uuml;cking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

    lost highway is not as puzzling as it might first appear. it's actually an old fashioned faustian drama adapted for a modern, lynchian age. it is also, likely the most advanced and fun film of our era; at least stylistically. fred has made a pact with the devil to be a great jazz musician - as the always scary robert blake says: you invited me into your home, it is not my business to go where i am not invited. the price fred must pay is his soul, and everything else during his time on earth.the devil, as is the literary tradition, finds this enormously amusing and enjoys toying with fred, and directs him to kill his wife. fred has no idea what is going on, because he is just a mortal pawn in a much larger game. he pays by being arrested and going to the chair. as he fries, he lives out his fantasty, the fantasy he thought he was bargaining for with the devil - his alter ego, pete - young, smooth, and a winner with the girls. but the fantasy is just that. we cannot escape our destiny, and in the end, fred/pete cannot hold true as the devil is in control, and the devil is coming to collect... hence, lost highway.

    For many people, I imagine, David Lynch's films are love them or hate them affairs. But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the "popular" statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything? The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible. Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams. Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film. However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans. Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story. With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean. Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.

    This movie is very weird, like any other Lynch movie. But the story is quite interesting and the characters are intriguing and not dull. What I didn't like was some use of the metaphors in the movie which I didn't understand until I read the explanation of the movie on the internet. Pullmans performance is very good and Arquettes a fine add to the movie. Also the thing I liked very much was the soundtrack which suits the movie perfectly. The movie length is just about right. I was surprised by the role of Robert Blake but it seemed he managed it quite good. All in all, a decent movie with complicated story, a solid seven out of ten from me.

    This was the first film which made me say 'What the hell am I watching?' Ever since watching Inception (a masterpiece), I got interested in watching confusing movies. So I Googled 'The most confusing movies ever'. In one of the results this film was ranked 3rd with the photo of that bloody mystery man with a camera in his hand. I was naturally interested. They even gave a synopsis of this movie. I got even more interested and finally I bought a CD. Really, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE MOVIE ABOUT? First they show a husband and wife living a happy life. Then they start receiving mystery tapes that shows their house and they get a bit worried. They call the cops, but to hell with the cops. They don't seem to have an idea. Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends. Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit. If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this.

    First of all, I would like to draw a paradigm between this movie and a painter who buys a 20 square meter canvas and paints a dot in the middle of it. So then he cr.ps about the instability and inconsistency of the universe and how he sees it through that dot. Not going to happen... This movie is weird, but not in a good way like "A Clockwork Orange" or Tarantino (Orange came to my mind because of the interior of the house, as Lynch tried to replicate the effect of the stage in Cubrick's movie. All I can say is NO WAY!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A PALE, BAD COPY...). The weirdness in "Lost Highway" comes from Lynch's radical misconception of understanding of human mind. But some people obviously love that. Some people love to think about themselves as weird and mystic and alternative. And that's where good grades come from. You don't understand it, but it's weird, so it's cool. Now back to the "mentalpiece". Things like those happened to the leading character just do not happen in the real or slightly surreal life. Little crazy masterminds do not exist. A club sax player with a 1 million $ house also does not exist. A situation when you kill someone and don't remember... Guess! Ain't gonna happen. If the director tried to make some metaphors to something, well, he failed. If this was a try of presenting human character, it failed. If there was a grade below one, well, this is an ultimate candidate for it. Now, I would rather spend the time to pull my toenails or listen to Paris Hilton's music, than to watch this movie again. My country was at war some 14 years ago and, trust me, it was nothing compared to this movie...

    My summary above was somewhat harsh, but Patricia Arquette's performance is one of the things i remembered most vividly about Lost Highway. The movie follows a non-linear narrative which is almost a standard today but has been a minor revolution at the time of it's creation. It is seldom that the crime underworld has been brought on screen in such a surrealist environment. Author's intent to lead the story nowhere is either well hidden or the producers held him on a tight leash. This hasn't been as successful in David Lynch's later work, but i think he's producing his own movies now. A large portion of my vote, however, goes for the scenes with scantily clad Patricia Arquette...

    As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music. So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places. Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home. Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelg&auml;nger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up. As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become. This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride. Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyonc&eacute; woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it. As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "f&uuml;cking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

    lost highway is not as puzzling as it might first appear. it's actually an old fashioned faustian drama adapted for a modern, lynchian age. it is also, likely the most advanced and fun film of our era; at least stylistically. fred has made a pact with the devil to be a great jazz musician - as the always scary robert blake says: you invited me into your home, it is not my business to go where i am not invited. the price fred must pay is his soul, and everything else during his time on earth.the devil, as is the literary tradition, finds this enormously amusing and enjoys toying with fred, and directs him to kill his wife. fred has no idea what is going on, because he is just a mortal pawn in a much larger game. he pays by being arrested and going to the chair. as he fries, he lives out his fantasty, the fantasy he thought he was bargaining for with the devil - his alter ego, pete - young, smooth, and a winner with the girls. but the fantasy is just that. we cannot escape our destiny, and in the end, fred/pete cannot hold true as the devil is in control, and the devil is coming to collect... hence, lost highway.

    For many people, I imagine, David Lynch's films are love them or hate them affairs. But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the "popular" statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything? The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible. Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams. Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film. However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans. Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story. With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean. Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.

    This movie is very weird, like any other Lynch movie. But the story is quite interesting and the characters are intriguing and not dull. What I didn't like was some use of the metaphors in the movie which I didn't understand until I read the explanation of the movie on the internet. Pullmans performance is very good and Arquettes a fine add to the movie. Also the thing I liked very much was the soundtrack which suits the movie perfectly. The movie length is just about right. I was surprised by the role of Robert Blake but it seemed he managed it quite good. All in all, a decent movie with complicated story, a solid seven out of ten from me.

    This was the first film which made me say 'What the hell am I watching?' Ever since watching Inception (a masterpiece), I got interested in watching confusing movies. So I Googled 'The most confusing movies ever'. In one of the results this film was ranked 3rd with the photo of that bloody mystery man with a camera in his hand. I was naturally interested. They even gave a synopsis of this movie. I got even more interested and finally I bought a CD. Really, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE MOVIE ABOUT? First they show a husband and wife living a happy life. Then they start receiving mystery tapes that shows their house and they get a bit worried. They call the cops, but to hell with the cops. They don't seem to have an idea. Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends. Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit. If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this. They would really really really feel excruciating pain.

    As of late, a great fan of David Lynch, I finally got round to watching Lost Highway. I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status. If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it. The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte "Everything we see hides another thing". Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being "Mulholland Drive  2001" and the third "Inland Empire  2006". One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who "forgot" to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge!

    One of the worst films I have ever struggled to sit through. I didn't know who the director was when I sat for this viewing, nor had ever heard of the film. I saw Bill Pullman and a few other names so gave it a try. This was a total bomb, as evidenced at the box office. Right off, one could tell the director was trying very hard for an obvious artsy appeal and lost big time. $15 million was wasted on this project and director. When I think of all the good stories and entertainment that struggled to get funding and something like this makes it to the screen, it makes me very disappointed in Hollywood. A very sad and ridiculous film.

    "Lost Highway" is a little like trying to watch television while someone in another room constantly changes the channel with the remote control. One theory, amongst many, contends that the movie replicates the feeling of schizophrenia. Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place &agrave; la the psychiatrist in "Psycho", but "Lost Highway" is particularly challenging as regards explanation. Another commentator thinks that "Lost Highway" is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie  circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie. A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes. Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping  they call the police. At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him. A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end. By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense  maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea  and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; "Lost Highway" is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around.

As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "f&uuml;cking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

    lost highway is not as puzzling as it might first appear. it's actually an old fashioned faustian drama adapted for a modern, lynchian age. it is also, likely the most advanced and fun film of our era; at least stylistically. fred has made a pact with the devil to be a great jazz musician - as the always scary robert blake says: you invited me into your home, it is not my business to go where i am not invited. the price fred must pay is his soul, and everything else during his time on earth.the devil, as is the literary tradition, finds this enormously amusing and enjoys toying with fred, and directs him to kill his wife. fred has no idea what is going on, because he is just a mortal pawn in a much larger game. he pays by being arrested and going to the chair. as he fries, he lives out his fantasty, the fantasy he thought he was bargaining for with the devil - his alter ego, pete - young, smooth, and a winner with the girls. but the fantasy is just that. we cannot escape our destiny, and in the end, fred/pete cannot hold true as the devil is in control, and the devil is coming to collect... hence, lost highway.

    For many people, I imagine, David Lynch's films are love them or hate them affairs. But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the "popular" statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything? The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible. Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams. Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film. However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans. Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story. With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean. Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.

    This movie is very weird, like any other Lynch movie. But the story is quite interesting and the characters are intriguing and not dull. What I didn't like was some use of the metaphors in the movie which I didn't understand until I read the explanation of the movie on the internet. Pullmans performance is very good and Arquettes a fine add to the movie. Also the thing I liked very much was the soundtrack which suits the movie perfectly. The movie length is just about right. I was surprised by the role of Robert Blake but it seemed he managed it quite good. All in all, a decent movie with complicated story, a solid seven out of ten from me.

    This was the first film which made me say 'What the hell am I watching?' Ever since watching Inception (a masterpiece), I got interested in watching confusing movies. So I Googled 'The most confusing movies ever'. In one of the results this film was ranked 3rd with the photo of that bloody mystery man with a camera in his hand. I was naturally interested. They even gave a synopsis of this movie. I got even more interested and finally I bought a CD. Really, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE MOVIE ABOUT? First they show a husband and wife living a happy life. Then they start receiving mystery tapes that shows their house and they get a bit worried. They call the cops, but to hell with the cops. They don't seem to have an idea. Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends. Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit. If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this. They would really really really feel excruciating pain.

    As of late, a great fan of David Lynch, I finally got round to watching Lost Highway. I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status. If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it. The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte "Everything we see hides another thing". Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being "Mulholland Drive  2001" and the third "Inland Empire  2006". One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who "forgot" to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge!

    One of the worst films I have ever struggled to sit through. I didn't know who the director was when I sat for this viewing, nor had ever heard of the film. I saw Bill Pullman and a few other names so gave it a try. This was a total bomb, as evidenced at the box office. Right off, one could tell the director was trying very hard for an obvious artsy appeal and lost big time. $15 million was wasted on this project and director. When I think of all the good stories and entertainment that struggled to get funding and something like this makes it to the screen, it makes me very disappointed in Hollywood. A very sad and ridiculous film.

    "Lost Highway" is a little like trying to watch television while someone in another room constantly changes the channel with the remote control. One theory, amongst many, contends that the movie replicates the feeling of schizophrenia. Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place &agrave; la the psychiatrist in "Psycho", but "Lost Highway" is particularly challenging as regards explanation. Another commentator thinks that "Lost Highway" is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie  circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie. A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes. Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping  they call the police. At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him. A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end. By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense  maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea  and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; "Lost Highway" is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around.

    First of all, I would like to draw a paradigm between this movie and a painter who buys a 20 square meter canvas and paints a dot in the middle of it. So then he cr.ps about the instability and inconsistency of the universe and how he sees it through that dot. Not going to happen... This movie is weird, but not in a good way like "A Clockwork Orange" or Tarantino (Orange came to my mind because of the interior of the house, as Lynch tried to replicate the effect of the stage in Cubrick's movie. All I can say is NO WAY!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A PALE, BAD COPY...). The weirdness in "Lost Highway" comes from Lynch's radical misconception of understanding of human mind. But some people obviously love that. Some people love to think about themselves as weird and mystic and alternative. And that's where good grades come from. You don't understand it, but it's weird, so it's cool. Now back to the "mentalpiece". Things like those happened to the leading character just do not happen in the real or slightly surreal life. Little crazy masterminds do not exist. A club sax player with a 1 million $ house also does not exist. A situation when you kill someone and don't remember... Guess! Ain't gonna happen. If the director tried to make some metaphors to something, well, he failed. If this was a try of presenting human character, it failed. If there was a grade below one, well, this is an ultimate candidate for it. Now, I would rather spend the time to pull my toenails or listen to Paris Hilton's music, than to watch this movie again. My country was at war some 14 years ago and, trust me, it was nothing compared to this movie...

    My summary above was somewhat harsh, but Patricia Arquette's performance is one of the things i remembered most vividly about Lost Highway. The movie follows a non-linear narrative which is almost a standard today but has been a minor revolution at the time of it's creation. It is seldom that the crime underworld has been brought on screen in such a surrealist environment. Author's intent to lead the story nowhere is either well hidden or the producers held him on a tight leash. This hasn't been as successful in David Lynch's later work, but i think he's producing his own movies now. A large portion of my vote, however, goes for the scenes with scantily clad Patricia Arquette...

    As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music. So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places. Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home. Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelg&auml;nger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up. As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become. This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride. Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyonc&eacute; woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it. As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "f&uuml;cking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.

    This movie is very weird, like any other Lynch movie. But the story is quite interesting and the characters are intriguing and not dull. What I didn't like was some use of the metaphors in the movie which I didn't understand until I read the explanation of the movie on the internet. Pullmans performance is very good and Arquettes a fine add to the movie. Also the thing I liked very much was the soundtrack which suits the movie perfectly. The movie length is just about right. I was surprised by the role of Robert Blake but it seemed he managed it quite good. All in all, a decent movie with complicated story, a solid seven out of ten from me.

    This was the first film which made me say 'What the hell am I watching?' Ever since watching Inception (a masterpiece), I got interested in watching confusing movies. So I Googled 'The most confusing movies ever'. In one of the results this film was ranked 3rd with the photo of that bloody mystery man with a camera in his hand. I was naturally interested. They even gave a synopsis of this movie. I got even more interested and finally I bought a CD. Really, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE MOVIE ABOUT? First they show a husband and wife living a happy life. Then they start receiving mystery tapes that shows their house and they get a bit worried. They call the cops, but to hell with the cops. They don't seem to have an idea. Then, they go to a party and a pale faced, eyebrows-less, pants shittingly scary man (who is aptly called 'The mystery man') comes to the husband and says creepy dialogues like 'We have met before, haven't we?' Then the wife suddenly dies of no reason and the husband is put in a prison where he mysteriously turns into some other guy. The wife of the first guy suddenly becomes the mistress of a short tempered porn film maker. The new guy falls in love with this mistress. The mystery man calls this new guy and again says some creepy dialogues. The new guy and the mistress prepares to run away. Then they go to a very deserted place and start having sex. Suddenly the girl disappears and the new guy turns into the old guy. Mystery man again comes and you know... says some creepy thing. The old guy along with the mystery man kills the porno film maker. The old guy goes to his house and says through the intercom 'dick Laurent is dead' and speed off in a car and mysteriously turns into the new guy while the police chases him and the film abruptly ends. Seriously, I don't get the universal appeal for this film. The only thing nice about this film is that whenever you are getting confused, boobs would appear on screen. I gave 1 star just for that. I didn't see anything else good in this dogshit. If you are a person trying to find new ways to torture someone, please do make your victims watch this. They would really really really feel excruciating pain.

    As of late, a great fan of David Lynch, I finally got round to watching Lost Highway. I am not sure it could be classified as a masterpiece, as many reviewers have claimed, but certainly weird, bizarre and perplexing enough (but without a meaningful, cohesive or purposeful plot) to realise why it flopped in the cinemas on release in the late 90s but now enjoying an almost cult status. If you are a mainstream cinema goer this film is not for you. However, If you are into niche, enigmatic, surreal dualistic existence, with a touch of constrained eroticism, that can be interpreted which ever way to suit a reasonable or gratifying explanation, you'll enjoy it. The parallel I would draw here is like looking at a Salvador Dally or Rene Magritte painting, trying to make sense of it and soon realise that it is far from being intuitive or apparent. You are however looking at a piece of great art, and in the words of Rene Magritte "Everything we see hides another thing". Similar feelings are evoked by the Lost Highway. It could be considered as the first instalment in a trilogy of psychological dream-like mystery thrillers, with the second being "Mulholland Drive  2001" and the third "Inland Empire  2006". One major criticism must unreservedly go to the DVD release owners who "forgot" to add any subtitles. So, if you are trying to pick up every word spoken (that at times are mumbled) or if you are hard of hearing, then this will present you with an additional challenge!

    One of the worst films I have ever struggled to sit through. I didn't know who the director was when I sat for this viewing, nor had ever heard of the film. I saw Bill Pullman and a few other names so gave it a try. This was a total bomb, as evidenced at the box office. Right off, one could tell the director was trying very hard for an obvious artsy appeal and lost big time. $15 million was wasted on this project and director. When I think of all the good stories and entertainment that struggled to get funding and something like this makes it to the screen, it makes me very disappointed in Hollywood. A very sad and ridiculous film.

    "Lost Highway" is a little like trying to watch television while someone in another room constantly changes the channel with the remote control. One theory, amongst many, contends that the movie replicates the feeling of schizophrenia. Although it may not be what Lynch had in mind, and certainly doesn't provide the perfect GPS for finding your way through this movie, it does warn you that the route ahead will probably be difficult. At a surface level, there are no resolutions; the film is as aimless as fate itself. Not that it should always be necessary for an explainer to come along and put everything in place &agrave; la the psychiatrist in "Psycho", but "Lost Highway" is particularly challenging as regards explanation. Another commentator thinks that "Lost Highway" is set in hell. The highway equates with the astral plane, the crossover point on the way to being born and after death. In this context, the body is a vehicle and the soul a passenger. Passengers can be exchanged, and other ones picked up, which neatly explains why different actors can play variations of the same character. The theory, which has much more to it, is supported by the cyclic nature of the movie  circular actions being associated with hell where the denizens are condemned to perform repetitive, pointless behaviour. Wow! What a great theory. One problem though, I'm pretty sure David Lynch hasn't signed off on it. In a way, it actually sounds better than Lynch's movie. A brief outline of the story is tricky but here goes. Bill Pullman plays Fred Madison, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, played by Patricia Arquette. When they receive a series of videos showing their home from the outside, then the inside, and then with them sleeping  they call the police. At a party Fred meets a mysterious man played by Robert Blake who seems to know him, and claims that he has been in his home. This mystery man, who could be Fred's alter ego or an astral spirit according to the hell theory, reappears throughout the film. Reality is altered when Fred enters a dark, seemingly endless corridor in his home. Fred receives another video that shows him possibly murdering his wife. He ends up in jail where his troubled mental state overwhelms him. A major transformation takes place at this point. When a guard checks on Fred's cell, he finds a completely different person in his place. No explanation is given for this change. The new character, Pete Dayton, played by Balthazar Getty is released and goes back to his former life, a different one to Fred Madison's. Many of the characters associated with Fred reappear in Pete's life but in different guises including Patricia Arquette as a gangster's girlfriend. Another complex scenario is played out before Fred Madison as played by Bill Pullman re-emerges towards the end. By the time this happens, most in the audience will have abandoned any notion that the film will make sense  maybe we do need an explainer after all. As Lynch reflects in the extras on the DVD, the film is based on an idea  and that's the only clue he gives. Maybe Lynch is training us to view cinema and storytelling in a completely new way. One thing is for sure; "Lost Highway" is one trip where you need to proceed with caution because Lynch has deliberately switched all the road signs around.

    First of all, I would like to draw a paradigm between this movie and a painter who buys a 20 square meter canvas and paints a dot in the middle of it. So then he cr.ps about the instability and inconsistency of the universe and how he sees it through that dot. Not going to happen... This movie is weird, but not in a good way like "A Clockwork Orange" or Tarantino (Orange came to my mind because of the interior of the house, as Lynch tried to replicate the effect of the stage in Cubrick's movie. All I can say is NO WAY!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A PALE, BAD COPY...). The weirdness in "Lost Highway" comes from Lynch's radical misconception of understanding of human mind. But some people obviously love that. Some people love to think about themselves as weird and mystic and alternative. And that's where good grades come from. You don't understand it, but it's weird, so it's cool. Now back to the "mentalpiece". Things like those happened to the leading character just do not happen in the real or slightly surreal life. Little crazy masterminds do not exist. A club sax player with a 1 million $ house also does not exist. A situation when you kill someone and don't remember... Guess! Ain't gonna happen. If the director tried to make some metaphors to something, well, he failed. If this was a try of presenting human character, it failed. If there was a grade below one, well, this is an ultimate candidate for it. Now, I would rather spend the time to pull my toenails or listen to Paris Hilton's music, than to watch this movie again. My country was at war some 14 years ago and, trust me, it was nothing compared to this movie...

    My summary above was somewhat harsh, but Patricia Arquette's performance is one of the things i remembered most vividly about Lost Highway. The movie follows a non-linear narrative which is almost a standard today but has been a minor revolution at the time of it's creation. It is seldom that the crime underworld has been brought on screen in such a surrealist environment. Author's intent to lead the story nowhere is either well hidden or the producers held him on a tight leash. This hasn't been as successful in David Lynch's later work, but i think he's producing his own movies now. A large portion of my vote, however, goes for the scenes with scantily clad Patricia Arquette...

    As much as I keep thinking about the content of 'Lost Highway', every time I watch it I'm so captivated by its style and atmosphere that I never really analyze what makes it work technically, nor do I have much of a desire to dissect it. Even so I know that it is a film-experience that very much feels unlike any other, with pretty simple frame compositions that focus on faces in front of monochrome walls or black nothingness and on intricate empty spaces alike, visually beautiful because the images are impactful, and a sound design that never lets up with what almost feels like wall-to-wall music. So with 'Lost Highway' we have a wife killer who for legal purposes isn't named O.J. Simpson but Fred Madison. As he's awaiting execution in his prison cell he's plagued by guilt, crippling headaches and a lack of sleep so he receives a sleeping pill that doesn't appear to be too successful at helping him fall asleep but it certainly helps him to go places. Fred takes a trip to wish fulfillment land where he is Pete, an attractive young lad with "half-biker, half-Beaver suburban parents" (thanks Donald Lyons) who don't forbid him to go out with his druggy friends at night but actually encourage him to do so. He's popular at work and talented at what he does. He has an influential friend who sticks up for him (preferably with a gun up somebody's butt) and a girlfriend who he is able to fully sexually please. And the sun is shining on him and on his next door neighbor's idyllic garden that unmistakably belongs to the poor guy who keeled over at the beginning of 'Blue Velvet' although except for the little family dog nobody seems to be at home. Skip to "This Magic Moment" as Pete hooks up with Alice, his criminally influential friend's girlfriend who conveniently is the blonde spitting image of Renee, Fred's dead wife. After some fun times in cheap motel rooms Pete starts to question Alice's sincerity about really carrying about him, she comes off as calculating as she seemingly out of nowhere comes up with a murder plot that requires Pete's assistance with him getting to do the dirty job. It recalls the plot of 'Double Indemnity' while a lot of minor things ooze of 'Vertigo', from the dame's blonde doppelg&auml;nger to a floating head in a dream to policemen tailing an unfaithful guy as he "gets more pussy than a toilet seat", but those small similarities add up. As the frame shakes and quakes from time to time and the image loses focus for a moment while the volume of the droning on the soundtrack fluctuates the dream gradually turns into a nightmare and the irony of it all is that Fred's fantasy-self eventually is the cause of his predicament for Pete ends up in the position of the guy who Fred's wife cheats on. After his elaborate trip of denial Fred probably understands this "other guy" better than ever but instead of this knowledge bringing about a catharsis it more and more makes his dream resemble the nightmare that his life has become. This "loss of control" is where the highway from the opaque movie title comes into play. The two credit sequences show the view from a car as it drives on a highway at night while David Bowie sings "cruise me, blonde - cruise me, babe" sounding like he's falling into an abyss as he lets everybody know "I'm deranged". As much as this image is associated with Lynch's film this particular highway actually is only seen once as part of the story. It's when Pete and Alice drive out into the desert after she got him to kill Andy for some money. Now she tells Pete that they have to meet a friend of hers who lives in a 'Kiss Me Deadly' cabin in the desert. He wouldn't know what else to do and of course he loves her so he goes along with it. But Alice is taking him for the proverbial ride. Fred thought he couldn't keep his wife in his own bed because he was a lousy lay, which was devastating enough for him to go mental on her and to cover their shared bedroom floor with her body parts like he was making his own little home movie adaption of the Black Dahlia case. But when Alice says to the stud Pete while having sex "You'll never have me" he makes a banally simple realization, a truth so basic that he can only hope to escape it by leaving wish fulfillment land behind and entering the world of his memories, the past as he remembers it, not necessarily how it happened. That truth is that woman isn't only flesh and bone and smooth skin but also soul, and unless maybe her name is Beyonc&eacute; woman isn't a thing that can be owned, not even if you like it and you put a ring on it. As the fantasy-bubble bursts and Pete turns into Fred again without a change of location his mysterious friend already awaits him to put the Betacam on him once more provoking him to face facts by insisting to say to the camera what his "f&uuml;cking name" is. But not all hope is lost quite yet, Fred still has enough delusion left in him to refabricate his memory making himself believe that he's prosecuted for taking revenge on the bastard who screwed his wife and making himself the sinister-voiced unknown who tells him that "Dick Laurent is dead" before the whole thing ever even started, a message that really tells him that it was all predestined to happen, that he's a victim of his own fate with him having no choice in the matter, that maybe Fred never even existed for he all along was a movie character stuck inside a film noir.

    lost highway is not as puzzling as it might first appear. it's actually an old fashioned faustian drama adapted for a modern, lynchian age. it is also, likely the most advanced and fun film of our era; at least stylistically. fred has made a pact with the devil to be a great jazz musician - as the always scary robert blake says: you invited me into your home, it is not my business to go where i am not invited. the price fred must pay is his soul, and everything else during his time on earth.the devil, as is the literary tradition, finds this enormously amusing and enjoys toying with fred, and directs him to kill his wife. fred has no idea what is going on, because he is just a mortal pawn in a much larger game. he pays by being arrested and going to the chair. as he fries, he lives out his fantasty, the fantasy he thought he was bargaining for with the devil - his alter ego, pete - young, smooth, and a winner with the girls. but the fantasy is just that. we cannot escape our destiny, and in the end, fred/pete cannot hold true as the devil is in control, and the devil is coming to collect... hence, lost highway.

    For many people, I imagine, David Lynch's films are love them or hate them affairs. But, frankly, I seem to fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize that Lynch has a strong visual style, and at times can create mesmerizing moments in his films. But then, he offsets those positive attributes with one-dimensional characters, indecipherable plots and, often, weirdness, it seems, for weirdness sake. Someone has described Lynch as the first popular surrealist, and that sounds a fitting description, although I would debate the "popular" statement, as most of Lynch's films are not box-office hits and have generated cult followings at best. Lost Highway fits right into this model: it features some absorbing imagery, a strong soundtrack at times, and some engrossing moments, but then, when all is said and done, does it really add up to anything? The plot of Lost Highway, what there is of one, focuses on Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) a saxophonist whose wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette), seems to be drifting away from him. Fred suspects she might be having an affair, but he can't be sure. One morning, Renee finds a videotape on the front steps that contains a black and white image of their home. The following day, another tape is found, this one following up the original imagery with an intruder, it would appear, videotaping Fred and Renee asleep in bed. At a party later, Fred is confronted by a chalk white skinned individual (Robert Blake, in what is, so far, his last role to date) who informs him he knows him, and that he is also at his home right then, which is corroborated by Fred phoning his home only to speak to the mystery man while he also stands in front of him. Shortly thereafter, Fred suddenly finds himself in jail, Renee dead, and the police believing he is responsible. Lost Highway then switches gears, and we are introduced to Pete (Balthazar Getty), a mechanic who is the favorite of a sadistic mob boss, Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who has a stunning blonde girlfriend, Alice (also Patricia Arquette). Pete and Alice begin to have an affair and make plans to run away together, but Pete is troubled by strange memories of things that happened a few nights ago that he can't fully remember and unnerving dreams. Lost Highway, like Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive, deals in elements of identity, memory, and guilt. Upon watching the whole film, you can kind of see what Lynch is trying for, and there are elements that seem to fit together, but nothing you can concretely say makes much sense if you follow your ideas through. The film has a very non-linear, dreamlike quality that, as mentioned above, Lynch would revisit in Mulholland Drive, but this very much seems to be a dress rehearsal for that later, better received film. However, while some can content themselves by calling Lynch a visual stylist and surrealist and forgiving him his trespasses, the rest of us who are looking for something in a film beyond a string of stunning images are, frankly, largely out of luck. In the end, the real problem with Lost Highway is not so much its convoluted narrative, but its lack of character development. The way Lynch directs his actors (and considering they all perform about the same, I find it difficult to believe it isn't Lynch calling the shots on this) much of the dialogue is delivered in a short, clipped and detached manner, as if the need to include words was an afterthought to Lynch who doesn't quite want to make a silent film. We learn little to nothing about the characters, there is no background, no insight into them as people, they are merely pawns for Lynch's visually driven plot machinations, not people. It doesn't help that the narrative suddenly changes focus at midpoint, and we are left dealing with a new set of characters and story that may or may not be connected to the earlier scenes. Again, these characters are thinly drawn, more types than three dimensional humans. Lost Highway displays Lynch's typical fascination with the 1950's. Both of the characters Arquette essays are traditional femme fatales, steeped in noir filmmaking, and most of the characters wear leather jackets, drive 50s cars or motorcycles and smoke rather ceaselessly. Loggia's performance as Mr. Eddy feels like a mid-Century mob boss and Pullman seems to channel a Beat-era avant garde musician. Again, it is all about Lynch assembling the imagery that intrigues him, less about telling a coherent story. With all that being said, Lost Highway can still draw you in at times. Many of the encounters involving Pete and Alice have an undeniable erotic charge to them and a flashback scene revealing how Alice and Mr. Eddy first met is a potent mix of sex and danger that is engrossing. The early scenes that introduce the mystery elements are also at times hypnotizing, but as the film draws to a close, and things don't really start adding up, and we are dealing with characters we don't really care about, Lost Highway begins deflating and we are left scratching our heads about what it all might mean. Lost Highway was one of Lynch's last gasps of popular success. He followed it up with The Straight Story, a very traditional drama that proved he could make a "normal" film, then Mulholland Drive which fit squarely in the Lynchian typical style that received a lot of critical acclaim but again suffered from the same issues that plague Lost Highway. Since then, Lynch has made only one full-length feature, 2006's little seen Inland Empire. Lynch is definitely not for everyone, I might tolerate him better than many, but Lost Highway is a typical sample of what you can usually expect from the director: gorgeous imagery, glossing over a somewhat vacant, at times frustrating, core. I wouldn't be surprised if he wouldn't want it any other way.
