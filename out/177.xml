 <sinopse>
  A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Blondie (The Good) is a professional gunslinger who is out trying to earn a few dollars. Angel Eyes (The Bad) is a hit man who always commits to a task and sees it through, as long as he is paid to do so. And Tuco (The Ugly) is a wanted outlaw trying to take care of his own hide. Tuco and Blondie share a partnership together making money off Tuco's bounty, but when Blondie unties the partnership, Tuco tries to hunt down Blondie. When Blondie and Tuco comes across a horse carriage loaded with dead bodies, they soon learn from the only survivor (Bill Carson) that he and a few other men have buried a stash of gold in a cemetery. Unfortunately Carson dies and Tuco only finds out the name of the cemetery, while Blondie finds out the name on the grave. Now the two must keep each other alive in order to find the gold. Angel Eyes (who had been looking for Bill Carson) discovers that Tuco and Blondie meet with Carson and knows they know the location of the gold. All he needs is for the two to ...

    The Good Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly Tuco (Eli Wallach) are racing to find buried gold during the civil war. Blondie and Tuco had a scam where Blondie would bring in Tuco for the reward. Just when Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie would shot Tuco down off the noose. Except the last time when Blondie double crossed Tuco and left him behind. So comrades in crime turn into enemies. Just as Blondie is about to be killed by Tuco, Blondie hears a name from a dead soldier. That name leading to the buried gold. So enemies become comrades in crime once again. The action is bigger than before. The scale of the movie is bigger. The number of people is bigger. The sets are bigger. The battle scene is gigantic. But it's Eli Wallach that steals the show. He is able to bring humor into this movie. He and Clint really have great chemistry together.

    The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is easily the best western I've seen so far. I must say I haven't explored many films from this genre, but I had the opportunity to check a few classics such as Unforgiven and Once Upon A Time in America in theaters a year ago. There is so much to like here I don't even know where to begin. We have plenty of humorous moments that work remarkably well thanks to a great comedic timing by the actors and how they provide their lines just effortlessly. The shootout scenes are always thrilling and very stylish to see, making the journey thoroughly entertaining. The iconic score by Ennio Morricone is simply amazing and I liked how there were variations of the main theme, being the soul of the film. Also, the cinematography here was magnificent, with some breathtaking landscapes in the background, terrific battle scenes (the whole bridge segment was brilliantly executed) as well as interesting close up shots which really enhanced the intensity in a lot of instances. Finally, how could I forget about that last standoff. Everything in that scene was mesmerizing! Just as I was recovering from such an intense moment, Sergio Leone presents us another striking situation between the leads, ending on a very high note. Now let's talk about the main characters here. I loved how each one of them are so distinguished and memorable in their own way. Tuco is a greedy bounty hunter who doesn't really care about anyone other than himself and is described as The Ugly. Eli Wallach was truly great as Tuco and I liked how he's always energetic and has a dark sense of humor. Blondie, The Good, is portrayed by Clint Eastwood and he would be my favorite character in the film. He is a complete bad ass, being very relaxed and cool no matter what situation he's in. Not only Blondie has masterful skills as a gunslinger, but is also a very compassionate fellow, making you respect the guy. The ambivalent partnership between these two worked really well. Then, we have Angel Eyes, The Bad, interpreted by Lee Van Cleef. His performance was also outstanding as this ruthless and senseless hit man who always gets the job done. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly absolutely deserves its high praise as one of the best films of all time, combining a beautiful score, gorgeous cinematography and well developed characters.

    The plot is snail-paced if you consider watching it in now (2013) mostly because, many sequences have huge potential to bore the hell out of you at a time of fast-paced action-thrillers. Now the discrepancies are mentioned, the epic western movie does strike multiple chords throughout its 3 hour time-line. The amazing climax, the gun-slinging shots, the surprise action moves & of course, human nature theme are portrayed with such brilliance that you wonder how much effort went behind them. The soundtrack is one more melodious thing about it. Cast performance is fantastic & Sergio Leone's direction works wonders with the genuine locations. The story is fresh & entertains fine. A humble 7.5 out of 10 for the wonderful & most probably the best western to come out of 20th century; that 21st century stands out. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for people who love westerns. Others may get bored. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity: Mild | Sex/Foreplay: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Mediocre | Smoking/Drugs: Very Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Porn: No

    Clint Eastwood returns as the mysterious wandering gunfighter & bounty hunter "The Man With No Name" (AKA "The Good"), along with Lee Van Cleef as evil gunfighter & bounty hunter "Angel Eyes" (AKA "The Bad") & finally Eli Wallach as bandit and lowlife "Tuco" (AKA "The Ugly") in Sergio Leone's brilliantly directed, unbelievably stylish, compelling, & mesmerizing finale to his "Dollars" trilogy, with an unforgettable, influential score by Mr. Morricone. Story has the three men looking for buried confederate gold in a cemetery, and the long, winding path it takes to get there. Though long, it is never overlong, being an amazingly involving story of three ruthless yet disparate men. Performances are perfect, script filled with funny & memorable lines, and climax in the cemetery, both the 'Ecstasy Of Gold' & ' Final Showdown' the perfect cinematic experience, so memorably does it combine character, story, direction, and score. My favorite film of all time, which stands up to repeated viewings. (I lost count!)

    The best western ever made period! In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns," Clint Eastwood reposed the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed "the Good," Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. "The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts," claimed Leone. "In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest." Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive "spaghetti western," rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).

    This film's one of my all time favorites featuring Clint Eastwood*hums the theme song*..You can enjoy what he brought to "Fistful Of Dollars" or later on "Unforgiven" (you may even appreciate him more for his series of Dirty Harry movies) but Eastwood knew how to deliver his lines and even better he understood the true West as an underbelly of lies, deception, and ultimately money for power..This film, in my opinion, was a social statement meant to make people aware that history authors like to glorify Western folk heroes because of their good deeds, yet also make us aware that every hero had a dark side that showed itself during the course of their lives out West..

    "The good, the bad and the ugly" is a western movie and for many people considered to be the best western movie of all times. It's a really interesting movie such as the plot and the storyline. I am thinking that at least one of the three protagonists of this movie (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) should have won an Oscar. I also think that maybe Sergio Leone should have won an Oscar for the direction and if not for this movie maybe for all the other good movies which has direct for example: For a few dollars more and A Fistful of Dollars. I like very much this movie because is a classic western movie with really good cast Clint Eastwood as The Good, Lee Van Cleef as The Bad and Eli Wallach as The Ugly.

    This movie is a timeless movie that will never lose its excellence. I am relatively young and i just watched it recently and I loved it so much. The acting, pretense,writing,and action is amazing. I love Clint Eastwood so much and this is by far my favorite movie of his. I normally hate all western but this is one of the only western movies I've ever liked. It definitely deserves its very high reviews and I don't expect them to go down any time soon. It's really easy to get a hold of because its free on amazon prime so you can watch it. Een though it is incredibly long it is definitely worth watching. You should watch it. Its amazing. Nuff said

    Part of the 'Man with no name' Trilogy, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is the third film produced by Sergio Leone in which Blondie (The Good, portrayed by Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (The Ugly, portrayed by Eli Wallach) form an uncomfortable alliance in the hunt for gold in a race against Sentenza/Angel Eyes (The Bad, portrayed by Lee Van Cleef). The film is set around the time of the American Civil war, and despite being the third instalment of what has become known as a trilogy, it is the first chronologically. The three films are not connected in any way other than the mysterious man with no name and can be watched in any order without spoiling each other although many will recommend them in the order of 'Fistful of Dollars', 'For a Few Dollars more' and then finally 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' simply for the reason that we can view Sergio Leone's progression as a director, each film arguably outdoing each other, with 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' often regarded as his best ever film. Throughout the film such an atmosphere is created that the viewer can feel the uncomfortable tension generated from the uneasy relationship of the characters, although some scenes feel tough and possibly slow, Leone uses his environment to maximise such feelings such as the scene where Tuco drags Blondie through the desert, close to death. Having viewed the extended version of the film, I am yet to view the cut version and with some great scenes being cut such as the alcoholic union officer I find it hard to understand why such scenes would be. The film can possibly be divided in to two halves; the first is a more long winded insight in to each three of the characters as Leone introduces us in to the lives of each, the second sees more fast paced action as the chase for gold accelerates, with the unpredictable characters competing against each other for a $200,000 dollar reward. Although Clint Eastwood is often regarded as the main character and the face of the film, Tuco finds himself having far more dialogue than his partner in what is a fantastic performance by a criminal who as the film title suggests, shows many ugly characteristics, however we perhaps find ourselves feeling sorry for a man who seems to show genuine emotions in certain scenes such as when he meets his brother, the head of a church. No review of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' would be complete without a mention for Ennio Morricone who adds magical and often haunting music that creates some fantastic and dramatic scenes. The film features probably one of the best musical scores ever for a film and Morricone's music is regarded as one of best features of Sergio Leone's Westerns. The final, inevitable scene emerges as the result of all these fantastic ingredients, fantastic acting and each character's attitude can be seen, Leone uses his close-up and dramatic style and Morricone compliments it brilliantly with his fantastic music. The film is in my opinion Leone's greatest ever film and possibly the greatest Western created.

The final, inevitable scene emerges as the result of all these fantastic ingredients, fantastic acting and each character's attitude can be seen, Leone uses his close-up and dramatic style and Morricone compliments it brilliantly with his fantastic music. The film is in my opinion Leone's greatest ever film and possibly the greatest Western created.

    The Good Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly Tuco (Eli Wallach) are racing to find buried gold during the civil war. Blondie and Tuco had a scam where Blondie would bring in Tuco for the reward. Just when Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie would shot Tuco down off the noose. Except the last time when Blondie double crossed Tuco and left him behind. So comrades in crime turn into enemies. Just as Blondie is about to be killed by Tuco, Blondie hears a name from a dead soldier. That name leading to the buried gold. So enemies become comrades in crime once again. The action is bigger than before. The scale of the movie is bigger. The number of people is bigger. The sets are bigger. The battle scene is gigantic. But it's Eli Wallach that steals the show. He is able to bring humor into this movie. He and Clint really have great chemistry together.

    The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is easily the best western I've seen so far. I must say I haven't explored many films from this genre, but I had the opportunity to check a few classics such as Unforgiven and Once Upon A Time in America in theaters a year ago. There is so much to like here I don't even know where to begin. We have plenty of humorous moments that work remarkably well thanks to a great comedic timing by the actors and how they provide their lines just effortlessly. The shootout scenes are always thrilling and very stylish to see, making the journey thoroughly entertaining. The iconic score by Ennio Morricone is simply amazing and I liked how there were variations of the main theme, being the soul of the film. Also, the cinematography here was magnificent, with some breathtaking landscapes in the background, terrific battle scenes (the whole bridge segment was brilliantly executed) as well as interesting close up shots which really enhanced the intensity in a lot of instances. Finally, how could I forget about that last standoff. Everything in that scene was mesmerizing! Just as I was recovering from such an intense moment, Sergio Leone presents us another striking situation between the leads, ending on a very high note. Now let's talk about the main characters here. I loved how each one of them are so distinguished and memorable in their own way. Tuco is a greedy bounty hunter who doesn't really care about anyone other than himself and is described as The Ugly. Eli Wallach was truly great as Tuco and I liked how he's always energetic and has a dark sense of humor. Blondie, The Good, is portrayed by Clint Eastwood and he would be my favorite character in the film. He is a complete bad ass, being very relaxed and cool no matter what situation he's in. Not only Blondie has masterful skills as a gunslinger, but is also a very compassionate fellow, making you respect the guy. The ambivalent partnership between these two worked really well. Then, we have Angel Eyes, The Bad, interpreted by Lee Van Cleef. His performance was also outstanding as this ruthless and senseless hit man who always gets the job done. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly absolutely deserves its high praise as one of the best films of all time, combining a beautiful score, gorgeous cinematography and well developed characters.

    The plot is snail-paced if you consider watching it in now (2013) mostly because, many sequences have huge potential to bore the hell out of you at a time of fast-paced action-thrillers. Now the discrepancies are mentioned, the epic western movie does strike multiple chords throughout its 3 hour time-line. The amazing climax, the gun-slinging shots, the surprise action moves & of course, human nature theme are portrayed with such brilliance that you wonder how much effort went behind them. The soundtrack is one more melodious thing about it. Cast performance is fantastic & Sergio Leone's direction works wonders with the genuine locations. The story is fresh & entertains fine. A humble 7.5 out of 10 for the wonderful & most probably the best western to come out of 20th century; that 21st century stands out. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for people who love westerns. Others may get bored. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity: Mild | Sex/Foreplay: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Mediocre | Smoking/Drugs: Very Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Porn: No

    Clint Eastwood returns as the mysterious wandering gunfighter & bounty hunter "The Man With No Name" (AKA "The Good"), along with Lee Van Cleef as evil gunfighter & bounty hunter "Angel Eyes" (AKA "The Bad") & finally Eli Wallach as bandit and lowlife "Tuco" (AKA "The Ugly") in Sergio Leone's brilliantly directed, unbelievably stylish, compelling, & mesmerizing finale to his "Dollars" trilogy, with an unforgettable, influential score by Mr. Morricone. Story has the three men looking for buried confederate gold in a cemetery, and the long, winding path it takes to get there. Though long, it is never overlong, being an amazingly involving story of three ruthless yet disparate men. Performances are perfect, script filled with funny & memorable lines, and climax in the cemetery, both the 'Ecstasy Of Gold' & ' Final Showdown' the perfect cinematic experience, so memorably does it combine character, story, direction, and score. My favorite film of all time, which stands up to repeated viewings. (I lost count!)

    The best western ever made period! In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns," Clint Eastwood reposed the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed "the Good," Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. "The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts," claimed Leone. "In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest." Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive "spaghetti western," rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).

    This film's one of my all time favorites featuring Clint Eastwood*hums the theme song*..You can enjoy what he brought to "Fistful Of Dollars" or later on "Unforgiven" (you may even appreciate him more for his series of Dirty Harry movies) but Eastwood knew how to deliver his lines and even better he understood the true West as an underbelly of lies, deception, and ultimately money for power..This film, in my opinion, was a social statement meant to make people aware that history authors like to glorify Western folk heroes because of their good deeds, yet also make us aware that every hero had a dark side that showed itself during the course of their lives out West..

    "The good, the bad and the ugly" is a western movie and for many people considered to be the best western movie of all times. It's a really interesting movie such as the plot and the storyline. I am thinking that at least one of the three protagonists of this movie (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) should have won an Oscar. I also think that maybe Sergio Leone should have won an Oscar for the direction and if not for this movie maybe for all the other good movies which has direct for example: For a few dollars more and A Fistful of Dollars. I like very much this movie because is a classic western movie with really good cast Clint Eastwood as The Good, Lee Van Cleef as The Bad and Eli Wallach as The Ugly.

    This movie is a timeless movie that will never lose its excellence. I am relatively young and i just watched it recently and I loved it so much. The acting, pretense,writing,and action is amazing. I love Clint Eastwood so much and this is by far my favorite movie of his. I normally hate all western but this is one of the only western movies I've ever liked. It definitely deserves its very high reviews and I don't expect them to go down any time soon. It's really easy to get a hold of because its free on amazon prime so you can watch it. Een though it is incredibly long it is definitely worth watching. You should watch it. Its amazing. Nuff said

    Part of the 'Man with no name' Trilogy, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is the third film produced by Sergio Leone in which Blondie (The Good, portrayed by Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (The Ugly, portrayed by Eli Wallach) form an uncomfortable alliance in the hunt for gold in a race against Sentenza/Angel Eyes (The Bad, portrayed by Lee Van Cleef). The film is set around the time of the American Civil war, and despite being the third instalment of what has become known as a trilogy, it is the first chronologically. The three films are not connected in any way other than the mysterious man with no name and can be watched in any order without spoiling each other although many will recommend them in the order of 'Fistful of Dollars', 'For a Few Dollars more' and then finally 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' simply for the reason that we can view Sergio Leone's progression as a director, each film arguably outdoing each other, with 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' often regarded as his best ever film. Throughout the film such an atmosphere is created that the viewer can feel the uncomfortable tension generated from the uneasy relationship of the characters, although some scenes feel tough and possibly slow, Leone uses his environment to maximise such feelings such as the scene where Tuco drags Blondie through the desert, close to death. Having viewed the extended version of the film, I am yet to view the cut version and with some great scenes being cut such as the alcoholic union officer I find it hard to understand why such scenes would be. The film can possibly be divided in to two halves; the first is a more long winded insight in to each three of the characters as Leone introduces us in to the lives of each, the second sees more fast paced action as the chase for gold accelerates, with the unpredictable characters competing against each other for a $200,000 dollar reward. Although Clint Eastwood is often regarded as the main character and the face of the film, Tuco finds himself having far more dialogue than his partner in what is a fantastic performance by a criminal who as the film title suggests, shows many ugly characteristics, however we perhaps find ourselves feeling sorry for a man who seems to show genuine emotions in certain scenes such as when he meets his brother, the head of a church. No review of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' would be complete without a mention for Ennio Morricone who adds magical and often haunting music that creates some fantastic and dramatic scenes. The film features probably one of the best musical scores ever for a film and Morricone's music is regarded as one of best features of Sergio Leone's Westerns.

There is so much to like here I don't even know where to begin. We have plenty of humorous moments that work remarkably well thanks to a great comedic timing by the actors and how they provide their lines just effortlessly. The shootout scenes are always thrilling and very stylish to see, making the journey thoroughly entertaining. The iconic score by Ennio Morricone is simply amazing and I liked how there were variations of the main theme, being the soul of the film. Also, the cinematography here was magnificent, with some breathtaking landscapes in the background, terrific battle scenes (the whole bridge segment was brilliantly executed) as well as interesting close up shots which really enhanced the intensity in a lot of instances. Finally, how could I forget about that last standoff. Everything in that scene was mesmerizing! Just as I was recovering from such an intense moment, Sergio Leone presents us another striking situation between the leads, ending on a very high note. Now let's talk about the main characters here. I loved how each one of them are so distinguished and memorable in their own way. Tuco is a greedy bounty hunter who doesn't really care about anyone other than himself and is described as The Ugly. Eli Wallach was truly great as Tuco and I liked how he's always energetic and has a dark sense of humor. Blondie, The Good, is portrayed by Clint Eastwood and he would be my favorite character in the film. He is a complete bad ass, being very relaxed and cool no matter what situation he's in. Not only Blondie has masterful skills as a gunslinger, but is also a very compassionate fellow, making you respect the guy. The ambivalent partnership between these two worked really well. Then, we have Angel Eyes, The Bad, interpreted by Lee Van Cleef. His performance was also outstanding as this ruthless and senseless hit man who always gets the job done. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly absolutely deserves its high praise as one of the best films of all time, combining a beautiful score, gorgeous cinematography and well developed characters.

    The plot is snail-paced if you consider watching it in now (2013) mostly because, many sequences have huge potential to bore the hell out of you at a time of fast-paced action-thrillers. Now the discrepancies are mentioned, the epic western movie does strike multiple chords throughout its 3 hour time-line. The amazing climax, the gun-slinging shots, the surprise action moves & of course, human nature theme are portrayed with such brilliance that you wonder how much effort went behind them. The soundtrack is one more melodious thing about it. Cast performance is fantastic & Sergio Leone's direction works wonders with the genuine locations. The story is fresh & entertains fine. A humble 7.5 out of 10 for the wonderful & most probably the best western to come out of 20th century; that 21st century stands out. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for people who love westerns. Others may get bored. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity: Mild | Sex/Foreplay: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Mediocre | Smoking/Drugs: Very Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Porn: No

    Clint Eastwood returns as the mysterious wandering gunfighter & bounty hunter "The Man With No Name" (AKA "The Good"), along with Lee Van Cleef as evil gunfighter & bounty hunter "Angel Eyes" (AKA "The Bad") & finally Eli Wallach as bandit and lowlife "Tuco" (AKA "The Ugly") in Sergio Leone's brilliantly directed, unbelievably stylish, compelling, & mesmerizing finale to his "Dollars" trilogy, with an unforgettable, influential score by Mr. Morricone. Story has the three men looking for buried confederate gold in a cemetery, and the long, winding path it takes to get there. Though long, it is never overlong, being an amazingly involving story of three ruthless yet disparate men. Performances are perfect, script filled with funny & memorable lines, and climax in the cemetery, both the 'Ecstasy Of Gold' & ' Final Showdown' the perfect cinematic experience, so memorably does it combine character, story, direction, and score. My favorite film of all time, which stands up to repeated viewings. (I lost count!)

    The best western ever made period! In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns," Clint Eastwood reposed the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed "the Good," Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. "The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts," claimed Leone. "In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest." Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive "spaghetti western," rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).

    This film's one of my all time favorites featuring Clint Eastwood*hums the theme song*..You can enjoy what he brought to "Fistful Of Dollars" or later on "Unforgiven" (you may even appreciate him more for his series of Dirty Harry movies) but Eastwood knew how to deliver his lines and even better he understood the true West as an underbelly of lies, deception, and ultimately money for power..This film, in my opinion, was a social statement meant to make people aware that history authors like to glorify Western folk heroes because of their good deeds, yet also make us aware that every hero had a dark side that showed itself during the course of their lives out West..

    "The good, the bad and the ugly" is a western movie and for many people considered to be the best western movie of all times. It's a really interesting movie such as the plot and the storyline. I am thinking that at least one of the three protagonists of this movie (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) should have won an Oscar. I also think that maybe Sergio Leone should have won an Oscar for the direction and if not for this movie maybe for all the other good movies which has direct for example: For a few dollars more and A Fistful of Dollars. I like very much this movie because is a classic western movie with really good cast Clint Eastwood as The Good, Lee Van Cleef as The Bad and Eli Wallach as The Ugly.

    This movie is a timeless movie that will never lose its excellence. I am relatively young and i just watched it recently and I loved it so much. The acting, pretense,writing,and action is amazing. I love Clint Eastwood so much and this is by far my favorite movie of his. I normally hate all western but this is one of the only western movies I've ever liked. It definitely deserves its very high reviews and I don't expect them to go down any time soon. It's really easy to get a hold of because its free on amazon prime so you can watch it. Een though it is incredibly long it is definitely worth watching. You should watch it. Its amazing. Nuff said

    Part of the 'Man with no name' Trilogy, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is the third film produced by Sergio Leone in which Blondie (The Good, portrayed by Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (The Ugly, portrayed by Eli Wallach) form an uncomfortable alliance in the hunt for gold in a race against Sentenza/Angel Eyes (The Bad, portrayed by Lee Van Cleef). The film is set around the time of the American Civil war, and despite being the third instalment of what has become known as a trilogy, it is the first chronologically. The three films are not connected in any way other than the mysterious man with no name and can be watched in any order without spoiling each other although many will recommend them in the order of 'Fistful of Dollars', 'For a Few Dollars more' and then finally 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' simply for the reason that we can view Sergio Leone's progression as a director, each film arguably outdoing each other, with 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' often regarded as his best ever film. Throughout the film such an atmosphere is created that the viewer can feel the uncomfortable tension generated from the uneasy relationship of the characters, although some scenes feel tough and possibly slow, Leone uses his environment to maximise such feelings such as the scene where Tuco drags Blondie through the desert, close to death. Having viewed the extended version of the film, I am yet to view the cut version and with some great scenes being cut such as the alcoholic union officer I find it hard to understand why such scenes would be. The film can possibly be divided in to two halves; the first is a more long winded insight in to each three of the characters as Leone introduces us in to the lives of each, the second sees more fast paced action as the chase for gold accelerates, with the unpredictable characters competing against each other for a $200,000 dollar reward. Although Clint Eastwood is often regarded as the main character and the face of the film, Tuco finds himself having far more dialogue than his partner in what is a fantastic performance by a criminal who as the film title suggests, shows many ugly characteristics, however we perhaps find ourselves feeling sorry for a man who seems to show genuine emotions in certain scenes such as when he meets his brother, the head of a church. No review of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' would be complete without a mention for Ennio Morricone who adds magical and often haunting music that creates some fantastic and dramatic scenes. The film features probably one of the best musical scores ever for a film and Morricone's music is regarded as one of best features of Sergio Leone's Westerns. The final, inevitable scene emerges as the result of all these fantastic ingredients, fantastic acting and each character's attitude can be seen, Leone uses his close-up and dramatic style and Morricone compliments it brilliantly with his fantastic music. The film is in my opinion Leone's greatest ever film and possibly the greatest Western created.

    The Good Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly Tuco (Eli Wallach) are racing to find buried gold during the civil war. Blondie and Tuco had a scam where Blondie would bring in Tuco for the reward. Just when Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie would shot Tuco down off the noose. Except the last time when Blondie double crossed Tuco and left him behind. So comrades in crime turn into enemies. Just as Blondie is about to be killed by Tuco, Blondie hears a name from a dead soldier. That name leading to the buried gold. So enemies become comrades in crime once again. The action is bigger than before. The scale of the movie is bigger. The number of people is bigger. The sets are bigger. The battle scene is gigantic. But it's Eli Wallach that steals the show. He is able to bring humor into this movie. He and Clint really have great chemistry together.

    The plot is snail-paced if you consider watching it in now (2013) mostly because, many sequences have huge potential to bore the hell out of you at a time of fast-paced action-thrillers. Now the discrepancies are mentioned, the epic western movie does strike multiple chords throughout its 3 hour time-line. The amazing climax, the gun-slinging shots, the surprise action moves & of course, human nature theme are portrayed with such brilliance that you wonder how much effort went behind them. The soundtrack is one more melodious thing about it. Cast performance is fantastic & Sergio Leone's direction works wonders with the genuine locations. The story is fresh & entertains fine. A humble 7.5 out of 10 for the wonderful & most probably the best western to come out of 20th century; that 21st century stands out. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for people who love westerns. Others may get bored. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity: Mild | Sex/Foreplay: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Mediocre | Smoking/Drugs: Very Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Porn: No

    I have been a fan of Cow Boy's since childhood. But it is only now after close to 20 years i really understood the level of quality this movie has. This is one of the best Movie's made in regards to me !! You ask and it has everything a great movie needs in it, The ever typical Cow boy's and the bandits in west can be a stereotype from this movie and none . Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach with Lee Wan Cliff are the best cast and as the title " The Good The Bad and The Ugly " Cheers ..

    Clint Eastwood returns as the mysterious wandering gunfighter & bounty hunter "The Man With No Name" (AKA "The Good"), along with Lee Van Cleef as evil gunfighter & bounty hunter "Angel Eyes" (AKA "The Bad") & finally Eli Wallach as bandit and lowlife "Tuco" (AKA "The Ugly") in Sergio Leone's brilliantly directed, unbelievably stylish, compelling, & mesmerizing finale to his "Dollars" trilogy, with an unforgettable, influential score by Mr. Morricone. Story has the three men looking for buried confederate gold in a cemetery, and the long, winding path it takes to get there. Though long, it is never overlong, being an amazingly involving story of three ruthless yet disparate men. Performances are perfect, script filled with funny & memorable lines, and climax in the cemetery, both the 'Ecstasy Of Gold' & ' Final Showdown' the perfect cinematic experience, so memorably does it combine character, story, direction, and score. My favorite film of all time, which stands up to repeated viewings. (I lost count!)

    The best western ever made period! In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns," Clint Eastwood reposed the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed "the Good," Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. "The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts," claimed Leone. "In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest." Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive "spaghetti western," rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).

    This film's one of my all time favorites featuring Clint Eastwood*hums the theme song*..You can enjoy what he brought to "Fistful Of Dollars" or later on "Unforgiven" (you may even appreciate him more for his series of Dirty Harry movies) but Eastwood knew how to deliver his lines and even better he understood the true West as an underbelly of lies, deception, and ultimately money for power..This film, in my opinion, was a social statement meant to make people aware that history authors like to glorify Western folk heroes because of their good deeds, yet also make us aware that every hero had a dark side that showed itself during the course of their lives out West..

    "The good, the bad and the ugly" is a western movie and for many people considered to be the best western movie of all times. It's a really interesting movie such as the plot and the storyline. I am thinking that at least one of the three protagonists of this movie (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) should have won an Oscar. I also think that maybe Sergio Leone should have won an Oscar for the direction and if not for this movie maybe for all the other good movies which has direct for example: For a few dollars more and A Fistful of Dollars. I like very much this movie because is a classic western movie with really good cast Clint Eastwood as The Good, Lee Van Cleef as The Bad and Eli Wallach as The Ugly.

    This movie is a timeless movie that will never lose its excellence. I am relatively young and i just watched it recently and I loved it so much. The acting, pretense,writing,and action is amazing. I love Clint Eastwood so much and this is by far my favorite movie of his. I normally hate all western but this is one of the only western movies I've ever liked. It definitely deserves its very high reviews and I don't expect them to go down any time soon. It's really easy to get a hold of because its free on amazon prime so you can watch it. Een though it is incredibly long it is definitely worth watching. You should watch it. Its amazing. Nuff said

    Part of the 'Man with no name' Trilogy, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is the third film produced by Sergio Leone in which Blondie (The Good, portrayed by Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (The Ugly, portrayed by Eli Wallach) form an uncomfortable alliance in the hunt for gold in a race against Sentenza/Angel Eyes (The Bad, portrayed by Lee Van Cleef). The film is set around the time of the American Civil war, and despite being the third instalment of what has become known as a trilogy, it is the first chronologically. The three films are not connected in any way other than the mysterious man with no name and can be watched in any order without spoiling each other although many will recommend them in the order of 'Fistful of Dollars', 'For a Few Dollars more' and then finally 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' simply for the reason that we can view Sergio Leone's progression as a director, each film arguably outdoing each other, with 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' often regarded as his best ever film. Throughout the film such an atmosphere is created that the viewer can feel the uncomfortable tension generated from the uneasy relationship of the characters, although some scenes feel tough and possibly slow, Leone uses his environment to maximise such feelings such as the scene where Tuco drags Blondie through the desert, close to death. Having viewed the extended version of the film, I am yet to view the cut version and with some great scenes being cut such as the alcoholic union officer I find it hard to understand why such scenes would be. The film can possibly be divided in to two halves; the first is a more long winded insight in to each three of the characters as Leone introduces us in to the lives of each, the second sees more fast paced action as the chase for gold accelerates, with the unpredictable characters competing against each other for a $200,000 dollar reward. Although Clint Eastwood is often regarded as the main character and the face of the film, Tuco finds himself having far more dialogue than his partner in what is a fantastic performance by a criminal who as the film title suggests, shows many ugly characteristics, however we perhaps find ourselves feeling sorry for a man who seems to show genuine emotions in certain scenes such as when he meets his brother, the head of a church. No review of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' would be complete without a mention for Ennio Morricone who adds magical and often haunting music that creates some fantastic and dramatic scenes. The film features probably one of the best musical scores ever for a film and Morricone's music is regarded as one of best features of Sergio Leone's Westerns. The final, inevitable scene emerges as the result of all these fantastic ingredients, fantastic acting and each character's attitude can be seen, Leone uses his close-up and dramatic style and Morricone compliments it brilliantly with his fantastic music. The film is in my opinion Leone's greatest ever film and possibly the greatest Western created.

    The Good Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly Tuco (Eli Wallach) are racing to find buried gold during the civil war. Blondie and Tuco had a scam where Blondie would bring in Tuco for the reward. Just when Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie would shot Tuco down off the noose. Except the last time when Blondie double crossed Tuco and left him behind. So comrades in crime turn into enemies. Just as Blondie is about to be killed by Tuco, Blondie hears a name from a dead soldier. That name leading to the buried gold. So enemies become comrades in crime once again. The action is bigger than before. The scale of the movie is bigger. The number of people is bigger. The sets are bigger. The battle scene is gigantic. But it's Eli Wallach that steals the show. He is able to bring humor into this movie. He and Clint really have great chemistry together.

    The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is easily the best western I've seen so far. I must say I haven't explored many films from this genre, but I had the opportunity to check a few classics such as Unforgiven and Once Upon A Time in America in theaters a year ago. There is so much to like here I don't even know where to begin. We have plenty of humorous moments that work remarkably well thanks to a great comedic timing by the actors and how they provide their lines just effortlessly. The shootout scenes are always thrilling and very stylish to see, making the journey thoroughly entertaining. The iconic score by Ennio Morricone is simply amazing and I liked how there were variations of the main theme, being the soul of the film. Also, the cinematography here was magnificent, with some breathtaking landscapes in the background, terrific battle scenes (the whole bridge segment was brilliantly executed) as well as interesting close up shots which really enhanced the intensity in a lot of instances. Finally, how could I forget about that last standoff. Everything in that scene was mesmerizing! Just as I was recovering from such an intense moment, Sergio Leone presents us another striking situation between the leads, ending on a very high note. Now let's talk about the main characters here. I loved how each one of them are so distinguished and memorable in their own way. Tuco is a greedy bounty hunter who doesn't really care about anyone other than himself and is described as The Ugly. Eli Wallach was truly great as Tuco and I liked how he's always energetic and has a dark sense of humor. Blondie, The Good, is portrayed by Clint Eastwood and he would be my favorite character in the film. He is a complete bad ass, being very relaxed and cool no matter what situation he's in. Not only Blondie has masterful skills as a gunslinger, but is also a very compassionate fellow, making you respect the guy. The ambivalent partnership between these two worked really well. Then, we have Angel Eyes, The Bad, interpreted by Lee Van Cleef. His performance was also outstanding as this ruthless and senseless hit man who always gets the job done. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly absolutely deserves its high praise as one of the best films of all time, combining a beautiful score, gorgeous cinematography and well developed characters.

    Clint Eastwood returns as the mysterious wandering gunfighter & bounty hunter "The Man With No Name" (AKA "The Good"), along with Lee Van Cleef as evil gunfighter & bounty hunter "Angel Eyes" (AKA "The Bad") & finally Eli Wallach as bandit and lowlife "Tuco" (AKA "The Ugly") in Sergio Leone's brilliantly directed, unbelievably stylish, compelling, & mesmerizing finale to his "Dollars" trilogy, with an unforgettable, influential score by Mr. Morricone. Story has the three men looking for buried confederate gold in a cemetery, and the long, winding path it takes to get there. Though long, it is never overlong, being an amazingly involving story of three ruthless yet disparate men. Performances are perfect, script filled with funny & memorable lines, and climax in the cemetery, both the 'Ecstasy Of Gold' & ' Final Showdown' the perfect cinematic experience, so memorably does it combine character, story, direction, and score. My favorite film of all time, which stands up to repeated viewings. (I lost count!)

    The best western ever made period! In the last and the best installment of his so-called "Dollars" trilogy of Sergio Leone-directed "spaghetti westerns," Clint Eastwood reposed the role of a taciturn, enigmatic loner. Here he searches for a cache of stolen gold against rivals the Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless bounty hunter, and the Ugly (Eli Wallach), a Mexican bandit. Though dubbed "the Good," Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. "The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts," claimed Leone. "In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest." Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive "spaghetti western," rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).

    This film's one of my all time favorites featuring Clint Eastwood*hums the theme song*..You can enjoy what he brought to "Fistful Of Dollars" or later on "Unforgiven" (you may even appreciate him more for his series of Dirty Harry movies) but Eastwood knew how to deliver his lines and even better he understood the true West as an underbelly of lies, deception, and ultimately money for power..This film, in my opinion, was a social statement meant to make people aware that history authors like to glorify Western folk heroes because of their good deeds, yet also make us aware that every hero had a dark side that showed itself during the course of their lives out West..

    "The good, the bad and the ugly" is a western movie and for many people considered to be the best western movie of all times. It's a really interesting movie such as the plot and the storyline. I am thinking that at least one of the three protagonists of this movie (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) should have won an Oscar. I also think that maybe Sergio Leone should have won an Oscar for the direction and if not for this movie maybe for all the other good movies which has direct for example: For a few dollars more and A Fistful of Dollars. I like very much this movie because is a classic western movie with really good cast Clint Eastwood as The Good, Lee Van Cleef as The Bad and Eli Wallach as The Ugly.

    This movie is a timeless movie that will never lose its excellence. I am relatively young and i just watched it recently and I loved it so much. The acting, pretense,writing,and action is amazing. I love Clint Eastwood so much and this is by far my favorite movie of his. I normally hate all western but this is one of the only western movies I've ever liked. It definitely deserves its very high reviews and I don't expect them to go down any time soon. It's really easy to get a hold of because its free on amazon prime so you can watch it. Een though it is incredibly long it is definitely worth watching. You should watch it. Its amazing. Nuff said

    Part of the 'Man with no name' Trilogy, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is the third film produced by Sergio Leone in which Blondie (The Good, portrayed by Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (The Ugly, portrayed by Eli Wallach) form an uncomfortable alliance in the hunt for gold in a race against Sentenza/Angel Eyes (The Bad, portrayed by Lee Van Cleef). The film is set around the time of the American Civil war, and despite being the third instalment of what has become known as a trilogy, it is the first chronologically. The three films are not connected in any way other than the mysterious man with no name and can be watched in any order without spoiling each other although many will recommend them in the order of 'Fistful of Dollars', 'For a Few Dollars more' and then finally 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' simply for the reason that we can view Sergio Leone's progression as a director, each film arguably outdoing each other, with 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' often regarded as his best ever film. Throughout the film such an atmosphere is created that the viewer can feel the uncomfortable tension generated from the uneasy relationship of the characters, although some scenes feel tough and possibly slow, Leone uses his environment to maximise such feelings such as the scene where Tuco drags Blondie through the desert, close to death. Having viewed the extended version of the film, I am yet to view the cut version and with some great scenes being cut such as the alcoholic union officer I find it hard to understand why such scenes would be. The film can possibly be divided in to two halves; the first is a more long winded insight in to each three of the characters as Leone introduces us in to the lives of each, the second sees more fast paced action as the chase for gold accelerates, with the unpredictable characters competing against each other for a $200,000 dollar reward. Although Clint Eastwood is often regarded as the main character and the face of the film, Tuco finds himself having far more dialogue than his partner in what is a fantastic performance by a criminal who as the film title suggests, shows many ugly characteristics, however we perhaps find ourselves feeling sorry for a man who seems to show genuine emotions in certain scenes such as when he meets his brother, the head of a church. No review of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' would be complete without a mention for Ennio Morricone who adds magical and often haunting music that creates some fantastic and dramatic scenes. The film features probably one of the best musical scores ever for a film and Morricone's music is regarded as one of best features of Sergio Leone's Westerns. The final, inevitable scene emerges as the result of all these fantastic ingredients, fantastic acting and each character's attitude can be seen, Leone uses his close-up and dramatic style and Morricone compliments it brilliantly with his fantastic music. The film is in my opinion Leone's greatest ever film and possibly the greatest Western created.

    The Good Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly Tuco (Eli Wallach) are racing to find buried gold during the civil war. Blondie and Tuco had a scam where Blondie would bring in Tuco for the reward. Just when Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie would shot Tuco down off the noose. Except the last time when Blondie double crossed Tuco and left him behind. So comrades in crime turn into enemies. Just as Blondie is about to be killed by Tuco, Blondie hears a name from a dead soldier. That name leading to the buried gold. So enemies become comrades in crime once again. The action is bigger than before. The scale of the movie is bigger. The number of people is bigger. The sets are bigger. The battle scene is gigantic. But it's Eli Wallach that steals the show. He is able to bring humor into this movie. He and Clint really have great chemistry together.

    The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is easily the best western I've seen so far. I must say I haven't explored many films from this genre, but I had the opportunity to check a few classics such as Unforgiven and Once Upon A Time in America in theaters a year ago. There is so much to like here I don't even know where to begin. We have plenty of humorous moments that work remarkably well thanks to a great comedic timing by the actors and how they provide their lines just effortlessly. The shootout scenes are always thrilling and very stylish to see, making the journey thoroughly entertaining. The iconic score by Ennio Morricone is simply amazing and I liked how there were variations of the main theme, being the soul of the film. Also, the cinematography here was magnificent, with some breathtaking landscapes in the background, terrific battle scenes (the whole bridge segment was brilliantly executed) as well as interesting close up shots which really enhanced the intensity in a lot of instances. Finally, how could I forget about that last standoff. Everything in that scene was mesmerizing! Just as I was recovering from such an intense moment, Sergio Leone presents us another striking situation between the leads, ending on a very high note. Now let's talk about the main characters here. I loved how each one of them are so distinguished and memorable in their own way. Tuco is a greedy bounty hunter who doesn't really care about anyone other than himself and is described as The Ugly. Eli Wallach was truly great as Tuco and I liked how he's always energetic and has a dark sense of humor. Blondie, The Good, is portrayed by Clint Eastwood and he would be my favorite character in the film. He is a complete bad ass, being very relaxed and cool no matter what situation he's in. Not only Blondie has masterful skills as a gunslinger, but is also a very compassionate fellow, making you respect the guy. The ambivalent partnership between these two worked really well. Then, we have Angel Eyes, The Bad, interpreted by Lee Van Cleef. His performance was also outstanding as this ruthless and senseless hit man who always gets the job done. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly absolutely deserves its high praise as one of the best films of all time, combining a beautiful score, gorgeous cinematography and well developed characters.

    The plot is snail-paced if you consider watching it in now (2013) mostly because, many sequences have huge potential to bore the hell out of you at a time of fast-paced action-thrillers. Now the discrepancies are mentioned, the epic western movie does strike multiple chords throughout its 3 hour time-line. The amazing climax, the gun-slinging shots, the surprise action moves & of course, human nature theme are portrayed with such brilliance that you wonder how much effort went behind them. The soundtrack is one more melodious thing about it. Cast performance is fantastic & Sergio Leone's direction works wonders with the genuine locations. The story is fresh & entertains fine. A humble 7.5 out of 10 for the wonderful & most probably the best western to come out of 20th century; that 21st century stands out. BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for people who love westerns. Others may get bored. Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity: Mild | Sex/Foreplay: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Mediocre | Smoking/Drugs: Very Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Porn: No

    I have been a fan of Cow Boy's since childhood. But it is only now after close to 20 years i really understood the level of quality this movie has. This is one of the best Movie's made in regards to me !! You ask and it has everything a great movie needs in it, The ever typical Cow boy's and the bandits in west can be a stereotype from this movie and none . Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach with Lee Wan Cliff are the best cast and as the title " The Good The Bad and The Ugly " Cheers ..
