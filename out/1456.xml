 <sinopse>
  On their way to Africa are a group of rogues who hope to get rich there, and a seemingly innocent British couple. They meet and things happen...
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A quartet of international crooks -- Peterson, O'Hara, Ross and Ravello -- is stranded in Italy while their steamer is being repaired. With them are the Dannreuthers. The six are headed for Africa, presumably to sell vacuum cleaners but actually to buy land supposedly loaded with uranium. They are joined by others who apparently have similar designs.

    Having much of the same talent as 1951's masterpiece "The African Queen", this film comes off as a total contradiction in its entirety, giving a dark view of humanity at its most amoral and laughing at it at the same time. A group of strangers are crowded together on a steamer and something shady is afoot. At first, you really can't figure out what's going on, because every time that the writers drop an important plot point, a distraction occurs which moves it into a different direction. The film is alternately wise and confusing, one moment with leading man Humphrey Bogart standing out with me where he is informed that Hitler and Mussolini like leaders will soon destroy the world. Bogart simply states that he would like another year or two to continue to be miserable. That statement applies to how many people seem to feel today, a cynical society in an ever increasing dangerous world where unhappiness seems to be a better option than total oblivion. Replacing Sydney Greenstreet as the villainous fat man, Robert Morley is a total contrast to his fearful missionary in "The African Queen". He's so instantly smarmy, you're surprised anybody even wants to be around him. Add in Peter Lorre (sadly a very undefined character) and two leading ladies (Jennifer Jones, highly resembling Vivien Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and the luscious Gina Lollobrigida, obviously somebody's "kept woman" here), and you have a dream cast. The remainder of the cast are cynical men who seem intent on creating more unhappiness, and while there are some surprising plot twists and sudden turns (people are believed to be dead, incorrectly it turns out) and everybody is in danger at all times. A ship's steward politely tells Bogart that the ship is sinking as if announcing dinner. It is obvious that John Huston had his tongue so far into his cheek he could taste last week's dinner, yet the inside joke wasn't let out on an unsuspecting public who, according to reviews, just didn't get it. I did, but it may not have been the filmmaker's ideas that I got, just my own visions of what the film said, at least to me. Along with another independently made Bogart film ("The Barefoot Contessa"), this is a film that doesn't necessarily work but with its star performances and a few dropped intelligent witticisms, can inspire some great thought. Otherwise, however, it is a pretentious bore.

    Humphrey Bogart is anything but suave. He looks silly with a feminine silk scarf beneath a dress shirt and blazer. He is also stiff as a comedic actor although I understand that he is the straight man who never utters a humorous line. The others are intended to be funny, but they don't pull it off too well, especially Robert Morley and Peter Lorre, who have been in comedies but are more believable as bad guys. Jennifer Jones is great, only because she was born in Tulsa, OK and does a fine job with a British accent, something most actors couldn't do in 1953. Still, she is not a comedic actress and that contributes to the mis-casting and the ultimate flatness of the film. The plot is weak and disorienting. I watched this film during a day-long TCM tribute to Bogart, and fortunately, it was played during my lunch hour. Perhaps, in eating lunch, I missed the point and the comedy, but I think NOT! The remainder of the films were excellent, however, I have to concede that I've seen these Bogart films many times, the most often being 'The Caine Mutiny' which I had to watch in college for an ROTC class and have been hooked on this film since. I continue to see something new with each viewing.

    This is a film that has be described as a " thriller , " a " comedy " A "romance " a " drama " and an " adventure " . In other words it has elements of being a cross genre movie . The cross genre movie was very popular in the 1980s when you'd get the likes of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and TOP GUN where the girls would flock to the cinema to swoon all over the hunky male star and get caught up in the on screen romance while boys would get involved in the macho culture of the military drama . In other words there's two distinct genres to the movie .Watching BEAT THE DEVIL you're aware there's no real distinct elements to the story There is indeed different elements at play here from a screenplay by Truman Capote but comes across as being very uneasy with itself as characters discuss love , fascism and other aspects of the human condition . This existentialist discussion might work very much better in a French New Wave movie but jars in a film that resembles a British B movie despite the exotic locations . For some reason everything has a dullness to it that one would never expect from Huston This is a film that seems more easier to market down to the casting rather than the storytelling . Humphrey Bogart was of course a screen legend but he seems to lack his usual charisma . People on this page have commentated that he looks ill and certainly you get the impression that his heart isn't in this movie . Indeed everyone involved has been much better in almost everything they've done and explains why BEAT THE DEVIL is relatively obscure when you think of the talent behind and in front of the screen

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort. Gwendolen is smitten with Billy, while Harry doesn't care much for him. On the other hand, Harry is smitten by Billy's seductive wife, Maria. Their steamer is delayed constantly, by a malfunctioning oil tank and a drunk captain. When Billy and one of his four acquaintances watch their car fall over a cliff, they are presumed dead, and one of the criminals lets Harry in on the secret, and Gwendolen confesses her love for Billy. When Billy and his acquaintance arrive back, everyone is confused, and then they get the call to board the steamer. It only gets more confusing, so I'll save you the trouble. When I finished Wise Blood, another Huston film, I was terribly perplexed. On one hand it was a very interesting film, on the other it left me cold, and confused. I didn't know how to review it, properly at least. I promised myself that if I ever came across a similarly perplexing film, I would think for a while before I wrote a review. When I first heard of this film, I immediately thought I would come across a similar situation. I mean, come on, have you heard the plot! Critically, it is also divisive. Roger Ebert placed it upon his Great Movies list, a list of the best films of all time, yet it has a 6.6 on IMDb. I was worried I would be overly confused by the plot and turned off by its craziness. What a surprise I found when I finished watching the film, and had a review already planned in my head. This film has been called a satire, but a satire of what? I cannot classify this as a satire, so what is it? The answer is very simple, it is an adventure film. I found myself laughing at many points, although it is not a comedy. It is certainly an odd film, yet it is entertaining to say the least and the tricky twists and turns of the plot are actually quite easy to follow. It seems like the whole cast is having a ball, with Bogart turning in the kind of cynical performance he is the master of. Jennifer Jones is blonde, and loving it. I haven't seen many films with her, so I can't quite judge her quality as an actress, but she is excellent as the devious Gwendolen Chelm. The typical English exterior is betrayed, as she reveals herself to be a scheming little devil with a voracious appetite, for love out side of her marriage. Peter Lorre, Robert Morely and Edward Underdown are all also excellent. The odd man, or should I say woman, out is Gina Lollobrigida. Her role as Bogart's young, sensuous Italian wife is certainly fine, but she seems to be in the wrong film. This may not be her fault, as it seems as if no one on this movie knew what they were going for. Her performance is a bit one note, which is never good, even in a adventurous romp like this film. To be fair she is never really given any stand out scenes. The screenplay seems incredibly muddled, yet it works in a very strange way. It seems that even working nights wasn't enough to stop Truman Capote from putting his own spin on the proceedings, and the dialog is one of the films strengths. Capote and Huston manage to keep the screenplay tight and lean, but some scenes could have been cut, and some are just unnecessary. This film can be found in the Public Domain, so the transfer isn't of the best quality. The cinematography is fair, but nothing truly stands out. The same can be said of the score, it works, but you don't find yourself humming it later on. The locations are beautiful and they work well for this type of story. Huston's direction reflects the tone of the story, relaxed, smooth and in control. It flows naturally, showing that Huston wasn't afraid to take it easy, while still remaining in command of his film. Overall, is it amazing? No, not really. Is it entertaining enough to serve as an enjoyable experience for 90 minutes? Yes, of course. It isn't thought-provoking. It isn't deeply psychological. It is entertaining, fast paced and likable. So yes, it's not bad. Beat the Devil, 1953, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones and Robert Morely. Directed by John Huston, 7.5/10 (B+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie. You can view this and other reviews at http://everyjohnhustonmovie.blogspot.ca/)

    I wanted to see this movie simply because I was somewhere in the middle of a Humphrey Bogart marathon. Truthfully, I must say that the main plot did not amaze right from the start. Even though the amount of great actors is really terrific, the performances that they give are, sadly, on a much lower level than they should be. Not one of the characters that we see (Billy Dannreuther and his wife, Mrs. Helm and her husband, and the four crooks) stand out from the group. One thing I can say about the four main characters - the crooks - is that their comedic appearances almost burst me into tears. If it was not for the fact that it is hard to attach this movie to one particular genre, and even the director was not sure what the final outcome was, I would have to say that this is one of the first parodies of a classical noir cinema. However, paradoxically, if it was meant to be a parody I would not say that it is truly a good one. That is what amazes me about this movie - you are not sure what kind of a flick you are watching, yet, if you want to categorize it becomes even less entertaining. Still, the plot is enjoyable, because of the obvious conflicts and scams overwhelming all of the greedy and suspicious characters. The events that occur in the three different places (Italy, ship and North Africa) are somewhat adorable, because of the comedic subplots. And in the end even the great old saying comes in handy - where two fight the third one wins. It is, ladies and gentlemen, as simple as that.

    From writer Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Innocents) and director John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), this film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and that was good enough reason for me to watch it. Basically a group of international criminals: Peterson (Robert Morley), Julius O'Hara (Peter Lorre), Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) and Ravello (Marco Tulli) have to wait for their steamer to be repaired, so are stranded in Italy. They are joined by the Dannreuthers, Billy (Humphrey Bogart) and Maria (Gina Lollobrigida), who are posing as vacuum cleaner salespeople, but they actually plan to buy some land in Africa supposedly loaded with valuable uranium. There are people with apparently similar ideas, so it is all a big scheme that will see the most clever and determined brains get what they want in the end. This is apparently a spoof of the Huston adventure movies The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Also starring Jennifer Jones as Mrs. Gwendolen Chelm, Edward Underdown as Harry Chelm, James Bond's Bernard Lee as Insp. Jack Clayton, Mario Perrone as Purser on SS Nyanga and Aldo Silvani as Charles - Restaurant Manager. Bogart does reasonably well as the head of the gang, Jones gets some good moments, and as the sly villain Morley has some amusing scenes with his posh English accent coming in handy, the other well known stars do fine too. I will admit that I did not understand the full story, and I didn't find myself laughing at much, but the adventure element is okay, and there are some relatively amusing moments, I'm not sure why it would be considered a must see film, but it is an alright comedy thriller. Worth watching!

    "A fortune hunting couple (Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida) join forces with a derelict group of four men (Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard and Marco Tulli) to find a uranium rich plot of land in Africa. While waiting for their ship to depart from Italy, they run into another scheming couple (Edward Underdown and Jennifer Jones). Soon all eight characters are drawn together in a race to see who can claim the fortune for themselves," according to the folks at synopsis central... An interesting mix of characters is wasted in this directionless, poorly paced attempt at a spoofing detective spy stories - like John Huston's own "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) - and wife-swapping. The legendary star appears tired, especially next to Ms. Lollobrigida, and not completely "in" on the joke. Though wasted, Ms. Jones contributes the best characterization; at least, she realizes how to strike the correct tone. Brought in to salvage the project, writer Truman Capote contributes some subtle wit; but, the resulting humor seems more dependent on accidentally bad filmmaking as it is on intentional comedy. **** Beat the Devil (11/24/53) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Robert Morley

    I do like John Huston's films a lot, so I feel really bad about saying this, but I didn't like Beat the Devil that much. I do like most of the cinematography and production values, there are some very witty lines and there are some amusing scenes. And Beat the Devil has a great cast, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and especially a suitably sly Robert Morley are very good in their roles and have good comic timing. On the other hand, John Huston's direction didn't work for me, he is a terrific director but you can tell comedy isn't his forte and I didn't feel that his heart was completely in it. The pace is also sluggish in places, but the real let down was the story. If I had to sum up the story in one phrase, would convoluted mess suffice? I loved the idea of it and all, and it started off grand, but then suddenly there is too much going on and it is hard to follow. So overall, I guess it's worth the look but I wasn't enthused with it, sorry. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    This is a great example of well written script, great direction and great acting. Capote's comedic dialog is precious. Huston's directing is a good example of letting fine actors, act and the repartee between Bogart, Jones and the other players is smooth and effortless. Present day movie makers could take a lesson from how to construct a character-driven movie from this entertaining film and young actors should be obligated to observe how real professionals ply their craft. The romantic farces that we get know just feature good looking actors repeating script lines and adding little to the creative process. Reference any movie with Jennifer Aniston, Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey or any number of other young stars and compare what they do to how Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida run through this script and you will see what I mean. At some point one feels like they are in the movie instead of just watching it. My only regret is that the DVD I watched didn't have subtitles.

    As Hollywood production became ever more individualised, with writers-directors and producer directors working independently of the studios, there were many pictures which attacked Hollywood conventions themselves. In Beat the Devil writer-director John Huston gives us a farcical take upon the recurring heist-gone-wrong subgenre. The style now known as film noir may not have been fully defined and discussed until the 60s, but any keen-minded cinemagoer can recognise a trend. And if a trend can be recognised then it is open to parody. It looks however as if Beat the Devil may have begun life as a serious thriller. All the business about criminals going after uranium mines in Africa seems fairly original, and is certainly not an archetypal noir plot. And really there is no grand satire here, and no lampooning of specific genre clich&eacute;s. The story's premise is essentially serious, yet is written with comedy characters and comical mishaps along the way. It's if Huston and his co-writer Truman Capote simply gave up on following it through and instead decided to have a bit of fun with it. Nevertheless, Huston shoots this one with the same thoughtfulness and precision as he would a drama. As always, he favours set-ups which keep multiple actors in shot together, background and foreground, minimising on cuts between them. With some neat movements he is able to bring the right person to our attention at the right moment, for example the scene in which we first see Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida. Bogart paces back and forth in the foreground moving in and out of shot, while Lollobrigida is in mid-shot but sat in the same place, meaning the two of them take turns to be the focal point without lots of editing or obtrusive camera-work. Another neat touch is when the major approaches Bogart at the outdoor table, starting off in the background as if an extra, until it becomes apparent he is worth taking note of. Huston's technique is about elaborate arrangement to keep all characters involved and performances intact without the distractions of film form. And here there are many characters and performances worth looking at. As befitting for the tone, this is a real outing for oddball supporting players. Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There's a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled  often impeccably  by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema. There's also a great turn by Jennifer Jones, at her most comical and almost unrecognisable as an eccentric Englishwoman, showing superb comic timing as she casually beats her husband at chess. With so much scene-stealing going on, it's possible to forget this is ostensibly a Humphrey Bogart movie. But while Beat the Devil is full of quirky characters and has numerous funny little moments, it doesn't have much point beside that. The humour is never exactly hilarious because the whole thing really doesn't seem conceived as a comedy. There's not enough of the interaction between crazy characters and sane world which drives wild comedy (such as the Marx Brothers), because in Beat the Devil virtually everyone and everything is crazy. Meanwhile the only completely straight characters (Bogart and Lollobrigida) are simply dull marginalised figures who exist separately from the comedy yet don't have the strength to perk up their end of the movie. Overall it is just a chaotic mess that happens to be worth a chuckle here and there.

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort. Gwendolen is smitten with Billy, while Harry doesn't care much for him. On the other hand, Harry is smitten by Billy's seductive wife, Maria. Their steamer is delayed constantly, by a malfunctioning oil tank and a drunk captain. When Billy and one of his four acquaintances watch their car fall over a cliff, they are presumed dead, and one of the criminals lets Harry in on the secret, and Gwendolen confesses her love for Billy. When Billy and his acquaintance arrive back, everyone is confused, and then they get the call to board the steamer. It only gets more confusing, so I'll save you the trouble. When I finished Wise Blood, another Huston film, I was terribly perplexed. On one hand it was a very interesting film, on the other it left me cold, and confused. I didn't know how to review it, properly at least. I promised myself that if I ever came across a similarly perplexing film, I would think for a while before I wrote a review. When I first heard of this film, I immediately thought I would come across a similar situation. I mean, come on, have you heard the plot! Critically, it is also divisive. Roger Ebert placed it upon his Great Movies list, a list of the best films of all time, yet it has a 6.6 on IMDb. I was worried I would be overly confused by the plot and turned off by its craziness. What a surprise I found when I finished watching the film, and had a review already planned in my head. This film has been called a satire, but a satire of what? I cannot classify this as a satire, so what is it? The answer is very simple, it is an adventure film. I found myself laughing at many points, although it is not a comedy. It is certainly an odd film, yet it is entertaining to say the least and the tricky twists and turns of the plot are actually quite easy to follow. It seems like the whole cast is having a ball, with Bogart turning in the kind of cynical performance he is the master of. Jennifer Jones is blonde, and loving it. I haven't seen many films with her, so I can't quite judge her quality as an actress, but she is excellent as the devious Gwendolen Chelm. The typical English exterior is betrayed, as she reveals herself to be a scheming little devil with a voracious appetite, for love out side of her marriage. Peter Lorre, Robert Morely and Edward Underdown are all also excellent. The odd man, or should I say woman, out is Gina Lollobrigida. Her role as Bogart's young, sensuous Italian wife is certainly fine, but she seems to be in the wrong film. This may not be her fault, as it seems as if no one on this movie knew what they were going for. Her performance is a bit one note, which is never good, even in a adventurous romp like this film. To be fair she is never really given any stand out scenes. The screenplay seems incredibly muddled, yet it works in a very strange way. It seems that even working nights wasn't enough to stop Truman Capote from putting his own spin on the proceedings, and the dialog is one of the films strengths. Capote and Huston manage to keep the screenplay tight and lean, but some scenes could have been cut, and some are just unnecessary. This film can be found in the Public Domain, so the transfer isn't of the best quality. The cinematography is fair, but nothing truly stands out. The same can be said of the score, it works, but you don't find yourself humming it later on. The locations are beautiful and they work well for this type of story. Huston's direction reflects the tone of the story, relaxed, smooth and in control. It flows naturally, showing that Huston wasn't afraid to take it easy, while still remaining in command of his film. Overall, is it amazing? No, not really. Is it entertaining enough to serve as an enjoyable experience for 90 minutes? Yes, of course. It isn't thought-provoking. It isn't deeply psychological. It is entertaining, fast paced and likable. So yes, it's not bad. Beat the Devil, 1953, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones and Robert Morely.

    I wanted to see this movie simply because I was somewhere in the middle of a Humphrey Bogart marathon. Truthfully, I must say that the main plot did not amaze right from the start. Even though the amount of great actors is really terrific, the performances that they give are, sadly, on a much lower level than they should be. Not one of the characters that we see (Billy Dannreuther and his wife, Mrs. Helm and her husband, and the four crooks) stand out from the group. One thing I can say about the four main characters - the crooks - is that their comedic appearances almost burst me into tears. If it was not for the fact that it is hard to attach this movie to one particular genre, and even the director was not sure what the final outcome was, I would have to say that this is one of the first parodies of a classical noir cinema. However, paradoxically, if it was meant to be a parody I would not say that it is truly a good one. That is what amazes me about this movie - you are not sure what kind of a flick you are watching, yet, if you want to categorize it becomes even less entertaining. Still, the plot is enjoyable, because of the obvious conflicts and scams overwhelming all of the greedy and suspicious characters. The events that occur in the three different places (Italy, ship and North Africa) are somewhat adorable, because of the comedic subplots. And in the end even the great old saying comes in handy - where two fight the third one wins. It is, ladies and gentlemen, as simple as that.

    From writer Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Innocents) and director John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), this film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and that was good enough reason for me to watch it. Basically a group of international criminals: Peterson (Robert Morley), Julius O'Hara (Peter Lorre), Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) and Ravello (Marco Tulli) have to wait for their steamer to be repaired, so are stranded in Italy. They are joined by the Dannreuthers, Billy (Humphrey Bogart) and Maria (Gina Lollobrigida), who are posing as vacuum cleaner salespeople, but they actually plan to buy some land in Africa supposedly loaded with valuable uranium. There are people with apparently similar ideas, so it is all a big scheme that will see the most clever and determined brains get what they want in the end. This is apparently a spoof of the Huston adventure movies The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Also starring Jennifer Jones as Mrs. Gwendolen Chelm, Edward Underdown as Harry Chelm, James Bond's Bernard Lee as Insp. Jack Clayton, Mario Perrone as Purser on SS Nyanga and Aldo Silvani as Charles - Restaurant Manager. Bogart does reasonably well as the head of the gang, Jones gets some good moments, and as the sly villain Morley has some amusing scenes with his posh English accent coming in handy, the other well known stars do fine too. I will admit that I did not understand the full story, and I didn't find myself laughing at much, but the adventure element is okay, and there are some relatively amusing moments, I'm not sure why it would be considered a must see film, but it is an alright comedy thriller. Worth watching!

    "A fortune hunting couple (Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida) join forces with a derelict group of four men (Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard and Marco Tulli) to find a uranium rich plot of land in Africa. While waiting for their ship to depart from Italy, they run into another scheming couple (Edward Underdown and Jennifer Jones). Soon all eight characters are drawn together in a race to see who can claim the fortune for themselves," according to the folks at synopsis central... An interesting mix of characters is wasted in this directionless, poorly paced attempt at a spoofing detective spy stories - like John Huston's own "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) - and wife-swapping. The legendary star appears tired, especially next to Ms. Lollobrigida, and not completely "in" on the joke. Though wasted, Ms. Jones contributes the best characterization; at least, she realizes how to strike the correct tone. Brought in to salvage the project, writer Truman Capote contributes some subtle wit; but, the resulting humor seems more dependent on accidentally bad filmmaking as it is on intentional comedy. **** Beat the Devil (11/24/53) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Robert Morley

    I do like John Huston's films a lot, so I feel really bad about saying this, but I didn't like Beat the Devil that much. I do like most of the cinematography and production values, there are some very witty lines and there are some amusing scenes. And Beat the Devil has a great cast, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and especially a suitably sly Robert Morley are very good in their roles and have good comic timing. On the other hand, John Huston's direction didn't work for me, he is a terrific director but you can tell comedy isn't his forte and I didn't feel that his heart was completely in it. The pace is also sluggish in places, but the real let down was the story. If I had to sum up the story in one phrase, would convoluted mess suffice? I loved the idea of it and all, and it started off grand, but then suddenly there is too much going on and it is hard to follow. So overall, I guess it's worth the look but I wasn't enthused with it, sorry. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    This is a great example of well written script, great direction and great acting. Capote's comedic dialog is precious. Huston's directing is a good example of letting fine actors, act and the repartee between Bogart, Jones and the other players is smooth and effortless. Present day movie makers could take a lesson from how to construct a character-driven movie from this entertaining film and young actors should be obligated to observe how real professionals ply their craft. The romantic farces that we get know just feature good looking actors repeating script lines and adding little to the creative process. Reference any movie with Jennifer Aniston, Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey or any number of other young stars and compare what they do to how Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida run through this script and you will see what I mean. At some point one feels like they are in the movie instead of just watching it. My only regret is that the DVD I watched didn't have subtitles.

    As Hollywood production became ever more individualised, with writers-directors and producer directors working independently of the studios, there were many pictures which attacked Hollywood conventions themselves. In Beat the Devil writer-director John Huston gives us a farcical take upon the recurring heist-gone-wrong subgenre. The style now known as film noir may not have been fully defined and discussed until the 60s, but any keen-minded cinemagoer can recognise a trend. And if a trend can be recognised then it is open to parody. It looks however as if Beat the Devil may have begun life as a serious thriller. All the business about criminals going after uranium mines in Africa seems fairly original, and is certainly not an archetypal noir plot. And really there is no grand satire here, and no lampooning of specific genre clich&eacute;s. The story's premise is essentially serious, yet is written with comedy characters and comical mishaps along the way. It's if Huston and his co-writer Truman Capote simply gave up on following it through and instead decided to have a bit of fun with it. Nevertheless, Huston shoots this one with the same thoughtfulness and precision as he would a drama. As always, he favours set-ups which keep multiple actors in shot together, background and foreground, minimising on cuts between them. With some neat movements he is able to bring the right person to our attention at the right moment, for example the scene in which we first see Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida. Bogart paces back and forth in the foreground moving in and out of shot, while Lollobrigida is in mid-shot but sat in the same place, meaning the two of them take turns to be the focal point without lots of editing or obtrusive camera-work. Another neat touch is when the major approaches Bogart at the outdoor table, starting off in the background as if an extra, until it becomes apparent he is worth taking note of. Huston's technique is about elaborate arrangement to keep all characters involved and performances intact without the distractions of film form. And here there are many characters and performances worth looking at. As befitting for the tone, this is a real outing for oddball supporting players. Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There's a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled  often impeccably  by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema. There's also a great turn by Jennifer Jones, at her most comical and almost unrecognisable as an eccentric Englishwoman, showing superb comic timing as she casually beats her husband at chess. With so much scene-stealing going on, it's possible to forget this is ostensibly a Humphrey Bogart movie. But while Beat the Devil is full of quirky characters and has numerous funny little moments, it doesn't have much point beside that. The humour is never exactly hilarious because the whole thing really doesn't seem conceived as a comedy. There's not enough of the interaction between crazy characters and sane world which drives wild comedy (such as the Marx Brothers), because in Beat the Devil virtually everyone and everything is crazy. Meanwhile the only completely straight characters (Bogart and Lollobrigida) are simply dull marginalised figures who exist separately from the comedy yet don't have the strength to perk up their end of the movie. Overall it is just a chaotic mess that happens to be worth a chuckle here and there.

    Having much of the same talent as 1951's masterpiece "The African Queen", this film comes off as a total contradiction in its entirety, giving a dark view of humanity at its most amoral and laughing at it at the same time. A group of strangers are crowded together on a steamer and something shady is afoot. At first, you really can't figure out what's going on, because every time that the writers drop an important plot point, a distraction occurs which moves it into a different direction. The film is alternately wise and confusing, one moment with leading man Humphrey Bogart standing out with me where he is informed that Hitler and Mussolini like leaders will soon destroy the world. Bogart simply states that he would like another year or two to continue to be miserable. That statement applies to how many people seem to feel today, a cynical society in an ever increasing dangerous world where unhappiness seems to be a better option than total oblivion. Replacing Sydney Greenstreet as the villainous fat man, Robert Morley is a total contrast to his fearful missionary in "The African Queen". He's so instantly smarmy, you're surprised anybody even wants to be around him. Add in Peter Lorre (sadly a very undefined character) and two leading ladies (Jennifer Jones, highly resembling Vivien Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and the luscious Gina Lollobrigida, obviously somebody's "kept woman" here), and you have a dream cast. The remainder of the cast are cynical men who seem intent on creating more unhappiness, and while there are some surprising plot twists and sudden turns (people are believed to be dead, incorrectly it turns out) and everybody is in danger at all times. A ship's steward politely tells Bogart that the ship is sinking as if announcing dinner. It is obvious that John Huston had his tongue so far into his cheek he could taste last week's dinner, yet the inside joke wasn't let out on an unsuspecting public who, according to reviews, just didn't get it. I did, but it may not have been the filmmaker's ideas that I got, just my own visions of what the film said, at least to me. Along with another independently made Bogart film ("The Barefoot Contessa"), this is a film that doesn't necessarily work but with its star performances and a few dropped intelligent witticisms, can inspire some great thought. Otherwise, however, it is a pretentious bore.

    Humphrey Bogart is anything but suave. He looks silly with a feminine silk scarf beneath a dress shirt and blazer. He is also stiff as a comedic actor although I understand that he is the straight man who never utters a humorous line. The others are intended to be funny, but they don't pull it off too well, especially Robert Morley and Peter Lorre, who have been in comedies but are more believable as bad guys. Jennifer Jones is great, only because she was born in Tulsa, OK and does a fine job with a British accent, something most actors couldn't do in 1953. Still, she is not a comedic actress and that contributes to the mis-casting and the ultimate flatness of the film. The plot is weak and disorienting. I watched this film during a day-long TCM tribute to Bogart, and fortunately, it was played during my lunch hour. Perhaps, in eating lunch, I missed the point and the comedy, but I think NOT! The remainder of the films were excellent, however, I have to concede that I've seen these Bogart films many times, the most often being 'The Caine Mutiny' which I had to watch in college for an ROTC class and have been hooked on this film since. I continue to see something new with each viewing.

    This is a film that has be described as a " thriller , " a " comedy " A "romance " a " drama " and an " adventure " . In other words it has elements of being a cross genre movie . The cross genre movie was very popular in the 1980s when you'd get the likes of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and TOP GUN where the girls would flock to the cinema to swoon all over the hunky male star and get caught up in the on screen romance while boys would get involved in the macho culture of the military drama . In other words there's two distinct genres to the movie .Watching BEAT THE DEVIL you're aware there's no real distinct elements to the story There is indeed different elements at play here from a screenplay by Truman Capote but comes across as being very uneasy with itself as characters discuss love , fascism and other aspects of the human condition . This existentialist discussion might work very much better in a French New Wave movie but jars in a film that resembles a British B movie despite the exotic locations . For some reason everything has a dullness to it that one would never expect from Huston This is a film that seems more easier to market down to the casting rather than the storytelling . Humphrey Bogart was of course a screen legend but he seems to lack his usual charisma . People on this page have commentated that he looks ill and certainly you get the impression that his heart isn't in this movie . Indeed everyone involved has been much better in almost everything they've done and explains why BEAT THE DEVIL is relatively obscure when you think of the talent behind and in front of the screen

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort. Gwendolen is smitten with Billy, while Harry doesn't care much for him. On the other hand, Harry is smitten by Billy's seductive wife, Maria. Their steamer is delayed constantly, by a malfunctioning oil tank and a drunk captain. When Billy and one of his four acquaintances watch their car fall over a cliff, they are presumed dead, and one of the criminals lets Harry in on the secret, and Gwendolen confesses her love for Billy.

    I do like John Huston's films a lot, so I feel really bad about saying this, but I didn't like Beat the Devil that much. I do like most of the cinematography and production values, there are some very witty lines and there are some amusing scenes. And Beat the Devil has a great cast, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and especially a suitably sly Robert Morley are very good in their roles and have good comic timing. On the other hand, John Huston's direction didn't work for me, he is a terrific director but you can tell comedy isn't his forte and I didn't feel that his heart was completely in it. The pace is also sluggish in places, but the real let down was the story. If I had to sum up the story in one phrase, would convoluted mess suffice? I loved the idea of it and all, and it started off grand, but then suddenly there is too much going on and it is hard to follow. So overall, I guess it's worth the look but I wasn't enthused with it, sorry. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    This is a great example of well written script, great direction and great acting. Capote's comedic dialog is precious. Huston's directing is a good example of letting fine actors, act and the repartee between Bogart, Jones and the other players is smooth and effortless. Present day movie makers could take a lesson from how to construct a character-driven movie from this entertaining film and young actors should be obligated to observe how real professionals ply their craft. The romantic farces that we get know just feature good looking actors repeating script lines and adding little to the creative process. Reference any movie with Jennifer Aniston, Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey or any number of other young stars and compare what they do to how Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida run through this script and you will see what I mean. At some point one feels like they are in the movie instead of just watching it. My only regret is that the DVD I watched didn't have subtitles.

    As Hollywood production became ever more individualised, with writers-directors and producer directors working independently of the studios, there were many pictures which attacked Hollywood conventions themselves. In Beat the Devil writer-director John Huston gives us a farcical take upon the recurring heist-gone-wrong subgenre. The style now known as film noir may not have been fully defined and discussed until the 60s, but any keen-minded cinemagoer can recognise a trend. And if a trend can be recognised then it is open to parody. It looks however as if Beat the Devil may have begun life as a serious thriller. All the business about criminals going after uranium mines in Africa seems fairly original, and is certainly not an archetypal noir plot. And really there is no grand satire here, and no lampooning of specific genre clich&eacute;s. The story's premise is essentially serious, yet is written with comedy characters and comical mishaps along the way. It's if Huston and his co-writer Truman Capote simply gave up on following it through and instead decided to have a bit of fun with it. Nevertheless, Huston shoots this one with the same thoughtfulness and precision as he would a drama. As always, he favours set-ups which keep multiple actors in shot together, background and foreground, minimising on cuts between them. With some neat movements he is able to bring the right person to our attention at the right moment, for example the scene in which we first see Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida. Bogart paces back and forth in the foreground moving in and out of shot, while Lollobrigida is in mid-shot but sat in the same place, meaning the two of them take turns to be the focal point without lots of editing or obtrusive camera-work. Another neat touch is when the major approaches Bogart at the outdoor table, starting off in the background as if an extra, until it becomes apparent he is worth taking note of. Huston's technique is about elaborate arrangement to keep all characters involved and performances intact without the distractions of film form. And here there are many characters and performances worth looking at. As befitting for the tone, this is a real outing for oddball supporting players. Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There's a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled  often impeccably  by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema. There's also a great turn by Jennifer Jones, at her most comical and almost unrecognisable as an eccentric Englishwoman, showing superb comic timing as she casually beats her husband at chess. With so much scene-stealing going on, it's possible to forget this is ostensibly a Humphrey Bogart movie. But while Beat the Devil is full of quirky characters and has numerous funny little moments, it doesn't have much point beside that. The humour is never exactly hilarious because the whole thing really doesn't seem conceived as a comedy. There's not enough of the interaction between crazy characters and sane world which drives wild comedy (such as the Marx Brothers), because in Beat the Devil virtually everyone and everything is crazy. Meanwhile the only completely straight characters (Bogart and Lollobrigida) are simply dull marginalised figures who exist separately from the comedy yet don't have the strength to perk up their end of the movie. Overall it is just a chaotic mess that happens to be worth a chuckle here and there.

    Having much of the same talent as 1951's masterpiece "The African Queen", this film comes off as a total contradiction in its entirety, giving a dark view of humanity at its most amoral and laughing at it at the same time. A group of strangers are crowded together on a steamer and something shady is afoot. At first, you really can't figure out what's going on, because every time that the writers drop an important plot point, a distraction occurs which moves it into a different direction. The film is alternately wise and confusing, one moment with leading man Humphrey Bogart standing out with me where he is informed that Hitler and Mussolini like leaders will soon destroy the world. Bogart simply states that he would like another year or two to continue to be miserable. That statement applies to how many people seem to feel today, a cynical society in an ever increasing dangerous world where unhappiness seems to be a better option than total oblivion. Replacing Sydney Greenstreet as the villainous fat man, Robert Morley is a total contrast to his fearful missionary in "The African Queen". He's so instantly smarmy, you're surprised anybody even wants to be around him. Add in Peter Lorre (sadly a very undefined character) and two leading ladies (Jennifer Jones, highly resembling Vivien Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and the luscious Gina Lollobrigida, obviously somebody's "kept woman" here), and you have a dream cast. The remainder of the cast are cynical men who seem intent on creating more unhappiness, and while there are some surprising plot twists and sudden turns (people are believed to be dead, incorrectly it turns out) and everybody is in danger at all times. A ship's steward politely tells Bogart that the ship is sinking as if announcing dinner. It is obvious that John Huston had his tongue so far into his cheek he could taste last week's dinner, yet the inside joke wasn't let out on an unsuspecting public who, according to reviews, just didn't get it. I did, but it may not have been the filmmaker's ideas that I got, just my own visions of what the film said, at least to me. Along with another independently made Bogart film ("The Barefoot Contessa"), this is a film that doesn't necessarily work but with its star performances and a few dropped intelligent witticisms, can inspire some great thought. Otherwise, however, it is a pretentious bore.

    Humphrey Bogart is anything but suave. He looks silly with a feminine silk scarf beneath a dress shirt and blazer. He is also stiff as a comedic actor although I understand that he is the straight man who never utters a humorous line. The others are intended to be funny, but they don't pull it off too well, especially Robert Morley and Peter Lorre, who have been in comedies but are more believable as bad guys. Jennifer Jones is great, only because she was born in Tulsa, OK and does a fine job with a British accent, something most actors couldn't do in 1953. Still, she is not a comedic actress and that contributes to the mis-casting and the ultimate flatness of the film. The plot is weak and disorienting. I watched this film during a day-long TCM tribute to Bogart, and fortunately, it was played during my lunch hour. Perhaps, in eating lunch, I missed the point and the comedy, but I think NOT! The remainder of the films were excellent, however, I have to concede that I've seen these Bogart films many times, the most often being 'The Caine Mutiny' which I had to watch in college for an ROTC class and have been hooked on this film since. I continue to see something new with each viewing.

    This is a film that has be described as a " thriller , " a " comedy " A "romance " a " drama " and an " adventure " . In other words it has elements of being a cross genre movie . The cross genre movie was very popular in the 1980s when you'd get the likes of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and TOP GUN where the girls would flock to the cinema to swoon all over the hunky male star and get caught up in the on screen romance while boys would get involved in the macho culture of the military drama . In other words there's two distinct genres to the movie .Watching BEAT THE DEVIL you're aware there's no real distinct elements to the story There is indeed different elements at play here from a screenplay by Truman Capote but comes across as being very uneasy with itself as characters discuss love , fascism and other aspects of the human condition . This existentialist discussion might work very much better in a French New Wave movie but jars in a film that resembles a British B movie despite the exotic locations . For some reason everything has a dullness to it that one would never expect from Huston This is a film that seems more easier to market down to the casting rather than the storytelling . Humphrey Bogart was of course a screen legend but he seems to lack his usual charisma . People on this page have commentated that he looks ill and certainly you get the impression that his heart isn't in this movie . Indeed everyone involved has been much better in almost everything they've done and explains why BEAT THE DEVIL is relatively obscure when you think of the talent behind and in front of the screen

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort. Gwendolen is smitten with Billy, while Harry doesn't care much for him. On the other hand, Harry is smitten by Billy's seductive wife, Maria. Their steamer is delayed constantly, by a malfunctioning oil tank and a drunk captain. When Billy and one of his four acquaintances watch their car fall over a cliff, they are presumed dead, and one of the criminals lets Harry in on the secret, and Gwendolen confesses her love for Billy. When Billy and his acquaintance arrive back, everyone is confused, and then they get the call to board the steamer. It only gets more confusing, so I'll save you the trouble. When I finished Wise Blood, another Huston film, I was terribly perplexed. On one hand it was a very interesting film, on the other it left me cold, and confused. I didn't know how to review it, properly at least. I promised myself that if I ever came across a similarly perplexing film, I would think for a while before I wrote a review. When I first heard of this film, I immediately thought I would come across a similar situation. I mean, come on, have you heard the plot! Critically, it is also divisive. Roger Ebert placed it upon his Great Movies list, a list of the best films of all time, yet it has a 6.6 on IMDb. I was worried I would be overly confused by the plot and turned off by its craziness. What a surprise I found when I finished watching the film, and had a review already planned in my head. This film has been called a satire, but a satire of what? I cannot classify this as a satire, so what is it? The answer is very simple, it is an adventure film. I found myself laughing at many points, although it is not a comedy. It is certainly an odd film, yet it is entertaining to say the least and the tricky twists and turns of the plot are actually quite easy to follow. It seems like the whole cast is having a ball, with Bogart turning in the kind of cynical performance he is the master of. Jennifer Jones is blonde, and loving it. I haven't seen many films with her, so I can't quite judge her quality as an actress, but she is excellent as the devious Gwendolen Chelm. The typical English exterior is betrayed, as she reveals herself to be a scheming little devil with a voracious appetite, for love out side of her marriage. Peter Lorre, Robert Morely and Edward Underdown are all also excellent. The odd man, or should I say woman, out is Gina Lollobrigida. Her role as Bogart's young, sensuous Italian wife is certainly fine, but she seems to be in the wrong film. This may not be her fault, as it seems as if no one on this movie knew what they were going for. Her performance is a bit one note, which is never good, even in a adventurous romp like this film. To be fair she is never really given any stand out scenes. The screenplay seems incredibly muddled, yet it works in a very strange way. It seems that even working nights wasn't enough to stop Truman Capote from putting his own spin on the proceedings, and the dialog is one of the films strengths. Capote and Huston manage to keep the screenplay tight and lean, but some scenes could have been cut, and some are just unnecessary. This film can be found in the Public Domain, so the transfer isn't of the best quality. The cinematography is fair, but nothing truly stands out. The same can be said of the score, it works, but you don't find yourself humming it later on. The locations are beautiful and they work well for this type of story. Huston's direction reflects the tone of the story, relaxed, smooth and in control. It flows naturally, showing that Huston wasn't afraid to take it easy, while still remaining in command of his film. Overall, is it amazing? No, not really. Is it entertaining enough to serve as an enjoyable experience for 90 minutes? Yes, of course. It isn't thought-provoking. It isn't deeply psychological. It is entertaining, fast paced and likable. So yes, it's not bad. Beat the Devil, 1953, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones and Robert Morely. Directed by John Huston, 7.5/10 (B+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie. You can view this and other reviews at http://everyjohnhustonmovie.blogspot.ca/)

    I wanted to see this movie simply because I was somewhere in the middle of a Humphrey Bogart marathon. Truthfully, I must say that the main plot did not amaze right from the start. Even though the amount of great actors is really terrific, the performances that they give are, sadly, on a much lower level than they should be. Not one of the characters that we see (Billy Dannreuther and his wife, Mrs. Helm and her husband, and the four crooks) stand out from the group. One thing I can say about the four main characters - the crooks - is that their comedic appearances almost burst me into tears. If it was not for the fact that it is hard to attach this movie to one particular genre, and even the director was not sure what the final outcome was, I would have to say that this is one of the first parodies of a classical noir cinema. However, paradoxically, if it was meant to be a parody I would not say that it is truly a good one. That is what amazes me about this movie - you are not sure what kind of a flick you are watching, yet, if you want to categorize it becomes even less entertaining. Still, the plot is enjoyable, because of the obvious conflicts and scams overwhelming all of the greedy and suspicious characters. The events that occur in the three different places (Italy, ship and North Africa) are somewhat adorable, because of the comedic subplots. And in the end even the great old saying comes in handy - where two fight the third one wins. It is, ladies and gentlemen, as simple as that.

    From writer Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Innocents) and director John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), this film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and that was good enough reason for me to watch it. Basically a group of international criminals: Peterson (Robert Morley), Julius O'Hara (Peter Lorre), Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) and Ravello (Marco Tulli) have to wait for their steamer to be repaired, so are stranded in Italy. They are joined by the Dannreuthers, Billy (Humphrey Bogart) and Maria (Gina Lollobrigida), who are posing as vacuum cleaner salespeople, but they actually plan to buy some land in Africa supposedly loaded with valuable uranium. There are people with apparently similar ideas, so it is all a big scheme that will see the most clever and determined brains get what they want in the end. This is apparently a spoof of the Huston adventure movies The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Also starring Jennifer Jones as Mrs. Gwendolen Chelm, Edward Underdown as Harry Chelm, James Bond's Bernard Lee as Insp. Jack Clayton, Mario Perrone as Purser on SS Nyanga and Aldo Silvani as Charles - Restaurant Manager. Bogart does reasonably well as the head of the gang, Jones gets some good moments, and as the sly villain Morley has some amusing scenes with his posh English accent coming in handy, the other well known stars do fine too. I will admit that I did not understand the full story, and I didn't find myself laughing at much, but the adventure element is okay, and there are some relatively amusing moments, I'm not sure why it would be considered a must see film, but it is an alright comedy thriller. Worth watching!

    "A fortune hunting couple (Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida) join forces with a derelict group of four men (Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard and Marco Tulli) to find a uranium rich plot of land in Africa. While waiting for their ship to depart from Italy, they run into another scheming couple (Edward Underdown and Jennifer Jones). Soon all eight characters are drawn together in a race to see who can claim the fortune for themselves," according to the folks at synopsis central... An interesting mix of characters is wasted in this directionless, poorly paced attempt at a spoofing detective spy stories - like John Huston's own "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) - and wife-swapping. The legendary star appears tired, especially next to Ms. Lollobrigida, and not completely "in" on the joke. Though wasted, Ms. Jones contributes the best characterization; at least, she realizes how to strike the correct tone. Brought in to salvage the project, writer Truman Capote contributes some subtle wit; but, the resulting humor seems more dependent on accidentally bad filmmaking as it is on intentional comedy. **** Beat the Devil (11/24/53) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Robert Morley

    Humphrey Bogart is anything but suave. He looks silly with a feminine silk scarf beneath a dress shirt and blazer. He is also stiff as a comedic actor although I understand that he is the straight man who never utters a humorous line. The others are intended to be funny, but they don't pull it off too well, especially Robert Morley and Peter Lorre, who have been in comedies but are more believable as bad guys. Jennifer Jones is great, only because she was born in Tulsa, OK and does a fine job with a British accent, something most actors couldn't do in 1953. Still, she is not a comedic actress and that contributes to the mis-casting and the ultimate flatness of the film. The plot is weak and disorienting. I watched this film during a day-long TCM tribute to Bogart, and fortunately, it was played during my lunch hour. Perhaps, in eating lunch, I missed the point and the comedy, but I think NOT! The remainder of the films were excellent, however, I have to concede that I've seen these Bogart films many times, the most often being 'The Caine Mutiny' which I had to watch in college for an ROTC class and have been hooked on this film since. I continue to see something new with each viewing.

    This is a film that has be described as a " thriller , " a " comedy " A "romance " a " drama " and an " adventure " . In other words it has elements of being a cross genre movie . The cross genre movie was very popular in the 1980s when you'd get the likes of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and TOP GUN where the girls would flock to the cinema to swoon all over the hunky male star and get caught up in the on screen romance while boys would get involved in the macho culture of the military drama . In other words there's two distinct genres to the movie .Watching BEAT THE DEVIL you're aware there's no real distinct elements to the story There is indeed different elements at play here from a screenplay by Truman Capote but comes across as being very uneasy with itself as characters discuss love , fascism and other aspects of the human condition . This existentialist discussion might work very much better in a French New Wave movie but jars in a film that resembles a British B movie despite the exotic locations . For some reason everything has a dullness to it that one would never expect from Huston This is a film that seems more easier to market down to the casting rather than the storytelling . Humphrey Bogart was of course a screen legend but he seems to lack his usual charisma . People on this page have commentated that he looks ill and certainly you get the impression that his heart isn't in this movie . Indeed everyone involved has been much better in almost everything they've done and explains why BEAT THE DEVIL is relatively obscure when you think of the talent behind and in front of the screen

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort. Gwendolen is smitten with Billy, while Harry doesn't care much for him. On the other hand, Harry is smitten by Billy's seductive wife, Maria. Their steamer is delayed constantly, by a malfunctioning oil tank and a drunk captain. When Billy and one of his four acquaintances watch their car fall over a cliff, they are presumed dead, and one of the criminals lets Harry in on the secret, and Gwendolen confesses her love for Billy. When Billy and his acquaintance arrive back, everyone is confused, and then they get the call to board the steamer. It only gets more confusing, so I'll save you the trouble. When I finished Wise Blood, another Huston film, I was terribly perplexed. On one hand it was a very interesting film, on the other it left me cold, and confused. I didn't know how to review it, properly at least. I promised myself that if I ever came across a similarly perplexing film, I would think for a while before I wrote a review. When I first heard of this film, I immediately thought I would come across a similar situation. I mean, come on, have you heard the plot! Critically, it is also divisive. Roger Ebert placed it upon his Great Movies list, a list of the best films of all time, yet it has a 6.6 on IMDb. I was worried I would be overly confused by the plot and turned off by its craziness. What a surprise I found when I finished watching the film, and had a review already planned in my head. This film has been called a satire, but a satire of what? I cannot classify this as a satire, so what is it? The answer is very simple, it is an adventure film. I found myself laughing at many points, although it is not a comedy. It is certainly an odd film, yet it is entertaining to say the least and the tricky twists and turns of the plot are actually quite easy to follow. It seems like the whole cast is having a ball, with Bogart turning in the kind of cynical performance he is the master of. Jennifer Jones is blonde, and loving it. I haven't seen many films with her, so I can't quite judge her quality as an actress, but she is excellent as the devious Gwendolen Chelm. The typical English exterior is betrayed, as she reveals herself to be a scheming little devil with a voracious appetite, for love out side of her marriage. Peter Lorre, Robert Morely and Edward Underdown are all also excellent. The odd man, or should I say woman, out is Gina Lollobrigida. Her role as Bogart's young, sensuous Italian wife is certainly fine, but she seems to be in the wrong film. This may not be her fault, as it seems as if no one on this movie knew what they were going for. Her performance is a bit one note, which is never good, even in a adventurous romp like this film. To be fair she is never really given any stand out scenes. The screenplay seems incredibly muddled, yet it works in a very strange way. It seems that even working nights wasn't enough to stop Truman Capote from putting his own spin on the proceedings, and the dialog is one of the films strengths. Capote and Huston manage to keep the screenplay tight and lean, but some scenes could have been cut, and some are just unnecessary. This film can be found in the Public Domain, so the transfer isn't of the best quality. The cinematography is fair, but nothing truly stands out. The same can be said of the score, it works, but you don't find yourself humming it later on. The locations are beautiful and they work well for this type of story. Huston's direction reflects the tone of the story, relaxed, smooth and in control. It flows naturally, showing that Huston wasn't afraid to take it easy, while still remaining in command of his film. Overall, is it amazing? No, not really. Is it entertaining enough to serve as an enjoyable experience for 90 minutes? Yes, of course. It isn't thought-provoking. It isn't deeply psychological. It is entertaining, fast paced and likable. So yes, it's not bad. Beat the Devil, 1953, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones and Robert Morely.

    I wanted to see this movie simply because I was somewhere in the middle of a Humphrey Bogart marathon. Truthfully, I must say that the main plot did not amaze right from the start. Even though the amount of great actors is really terrific, the performances that they give are, sadly, on a much lower level than they should be. Not one of the characters that we see (Billy Dannreuther and his wife, Mrs. Helm and her husband, and the four crooks) stand out from the group. One thing I can say about the four main characters - the crooks - is that their comedic appearances almost burst me into tears. If it was not for the fact that it is hard to attach this movie to one particular genre, and even the director was not sure what the final outcome was, I would have to say that this is one of the first parodies of a classical noir cinema. However, paradoxically, if it was meant to be a parody I would not say that it is truly a good one. That is what amazes me about this movie - you are not sure what kind of a flick you are watching, yet, if you want to categorize it becomes even less entertaining. Still, the plot is enjoyable, because of the obvious conflicts and scams overwhelming all of the greedy and suspicious characters. The events that occur in the three different places (Italy, ship and North Africa) are somewhat adorable, because of the comedic subplots. And in the end even the great old saying comes in handy - where two fight the third one wins. It is, ladies and gentlemen, as simple as that.

    From writer Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Innocents) and director John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), this film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and that was good enough reason for me to watch it. Basically a group of international criminals: Peterson (Robert Morley), Julius O'Hara (Peter Lorre), Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) and Ravello (Marco Tulli) have to wait for their steamer to be repaired, so are stranded in Italy. They are joined by the Dannreuthers, Billy (Humphrey Bogart) and Maria (Gina Lollobrigida), who are posing as vacuum cleaner salespeople, but they actually plan to buy some land in Africa supposedly loaded with valuable uranium. There are people with apparently similar ideas, so it is all a big scheme that will see the most clever and determined brains get what they want in the end. This is apparently a spoof of the Huston adventure movies The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Also starring Jennifer Jones as Mrs. Gwendolen Chelm, Edward Underdown as Harry Chelm, James Bond's Bernard Lee as Insp. Jack Clayton, Mario Perrone as Purser on SS Nyanga and Aldo Silvani as Charles - Restaurant Manager. Bogart does reasonably well as the head of the gang, Jones gets some good moments, and as the sly villain Morley has some amusing scenes with his posh English accent coming in handy, the other well known stars do fine too. I will admit that I did not understand the full story, and I didn't find myself laughing at much, but the adventure element is okay, and there are some relatively amusing moments, I'm not sure why it would be considered a must see film, but it is an alright comedy thriller. Worth watching!

    "A fortune hunting couple (Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida) join forces with a derelict group of four men (Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard and Marco Tulli) to find a uranium rich plot of land in Africa. While waiting for their ship to depart from Italy, they run into another scheming couple (Edward Underdown and Jennifer Jones). Soon all eight characters are drawn together in a race to see who can claim the fortune for themselves," according to the folks at synopsis central... An interesting mix of characters is wasted in this directionless, poorly paced attempt at a spoofing detective spy stories - like John Huston's own "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) - and wife-swapping. The legendary star appears tired, especially next to Ms. Lollobrigida, and not completely "in" on the joke. Though wasted, Ms. Jones contributes the best characterization; at least, she realizes how to strike the correct tone. Brought in to salvage the project, writer Truman Capote contributes some subtle wit; but, the resulting humor seems more dependent on accidentally bad filmmaking as it is on intentional comedy. **** Beat the Devil (11/24/53) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Robert Morley

    I do like John Huston's films a lot, so I feel really bad about saying this, but I didn't like Beat the Devil that much. I do like most of the cinematography and production values, there are some very witty lines and there are some amusing scenes. And Beat the Devil has a great cast, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and especially a suitably sly Robert Morley are very good in their roles and have good comic timing. On the other hand, John Huston's direction didn't work for me, he is a terrific director but you can tell comedy isn't his forte and I didn't feel that his heart was completely in it. The pace is also sluggish in places, but the real let down was the story. If I had to sum up the story in one phrase, would convoluted mess suffice? I loved the idea of it and all, and it started off grand, but then suddenly there is too much going on and it is hard to follow. So overall, I guess it's worth the look but I wasn't enthused with it, sorry. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    This is a great example of well written script, great direction and great acting. Capote's comedic dialog is precious. Huston's directing is a good example of letting fine actors, act and the repartee between Bogart, Jones and the other players is smooth and effortless. Present day movie makers could take a lesson from how to construct a character-driven movie from this entertaining film and young actors should be obligated to observe how real professionals ply their craft. The romantic farces that we get know just feature good looking actors repeating script lines and adding little to the creative process. Reference any movie with Jennifer Aniston, Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey or any number of other young stars and compare what they do to how Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida run through this script and you will see what I mean. At some point one feels like they are in the movie instead of just watching it. My only regret is that the DVD I watched didn't have subtitles.

    As Hollywood production became ever more individualised, with writers-directors and producer directors working independently of the studios, there were many pictures which attacked Hollywood conventions themselves. In Beat the Devil writer-director John Huston gives us a farcical take upon the recurring heist-gone-wrong subgenre. The style now known as film noir may not have been fully defined and discussed until the 60s, but any keen-minded cinemagoer can recognise a trend. And if a trend can be recognised then it is open to parody. It looks however as if Beat the Devil may have begun life as a serious thriller. All the business about criminals going after uranium mines in Africa seems fairly original, and is certainly not an archetypal noir plot. And really there is no grand satire here, and no lampooning of specific genre clich&eacute;s. The story's premise is essentially serious, yet is written with comedy characters and comical mishaps along the way. It's if Huston and his co-writer Truman Capote simply gave up on following it through and instead decided to have a bit of fun with it. Nevertheless, Huston shoots this one with the same thoughtfulness and precision as he would a drama. As always, he favours set-ups which keep multiple actors in shot together, background and foreground, minimising on cuts between them. With some neat movements he is able to bring the right person to our attention at the right moment, for example the scene in which we first see Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida. Bogart paces back and forth in the foreground moving in and out of shot, while Lollobrigida is in mid-shot but sat in the same place, meaning the two of them take turns to be the focal point without lots of editing or obtrusive camera-work. Another neat touch is when the major approaches Bogart at the outdoor table, starting off in the background as if an extra, until it becomes apparent he is worth taking note of. Huston's technique is about elaborate arrangement to keep all characters involved and performances intact without the distractions of film form. And here there are many characters and performances worth looking at. As befitting for the tone, this is a real outing for oddball supporting players. Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There's a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled  often impeccably  by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema. There's also a great turn by Jennifer Jones, at her most comical and almost unrecognisable as an eccentric Englishwoman, showing superb comic timing as she casually beats her husband at chess. With so much scene-stealing going on, it's possible to forget this is ostensibly a Humphrey Bogart movie. But while Beat the Devil is full of quirky characters and has numerous funny little moments, it doesn't have much point beside that. The humour is never exactly hilarious because the whole thing really doesn't seem conceived as a comedy. There's not enough of the interaction between crazy characters and sane world which drives wild comedy (such as the Marx Brothers), because in Beat the Devil virtually everyone and everything is crazy. Meanwhile the only completely straight characters (Bogart and Lollobrigida) are simply dull marginalised figures who exist separately from the comedy yet don't have the strength to perk up their end of the movie. Overall it is just a chaotic mess that happens to be worth a chuckle here and there.

    Having much of the same talent as 1951's masterpiece "The African Queen", this film comes off as a total contradiction in its entirety, giving a dark view of humanity at its most amoral and laughing at it at the same time. A group of strangers are crowded together on a steamer and something shady is afoot. At first, you really can't figure out what's going on, because every time that the writers drop an important plot point, a distraction occurs which moves it into a different direction. The film is alternately wise and confusing, one moment with leading man Humphrey Bogart standing out with me where he is informed that Hitler and Mussolini like leaders will soon destroy the world. Bogart simply states that he would like another year or two to continue to be miserable. That statement applies to how many people seem to feel today, a cynical society in an ever increasing dangerous world where unhappiness seems to be a better option than total oblivion. Replacing Sydney Greenstreet as the villainous fat man, Robert Morley is a total contrast to his fearful missionary in "The African Queen". He's so instantly smarmy, you're surprised anybody even wants to be around him. Add in Peter Lorre (sadly a very undefined character) and two leading ladies (Jennifer Jones, highly resembling Vivien Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and the luscious Gina Lollobrigida, obviously somebody's "kept woman" here), and you have a dream cast. The remainder of the cast are cynical men who seem intent on creating more unhappiness, and while there are some surprising plot twists and sudden turns (people are believed to be dead, incorrectly it turns out) and everybody is in danger at all times. A ship's steward politely tells Bogart that the ship is sinking as if announcing dinner. It is obvious that John Huston had his tongue so far into his cheek he could taste last week's dinner, yet the inside joke wasn't let out on an unsuspecting public who, according to reviews, just didn't get it. I did, but it may not have been the filmmaker's ideas that I got, just my own visions of what the film said, at least to me. Along with another independently made Bogart film ("The Barefoot Contessa"), this is a film that doesn't necessarily work but with its star performances and a few dropped intelligent witticisms, can inspire some great thought. Otherwise, however, it is a pretentious bore.

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort.

That is what amazes me about this movie - you are not sure what kind of a flick you are watching, yet, if you want to categorize it becomes even less entertaining. Still, the plot is enjoyable, because of the obvious conflicts and scams overwhelming all of the greedy and suspicious characters. The events that occur in the three different places (Italy, ship and North Africa) are somewhat adorable, because of the comedic subplots. And in the end even the great old saying comes in handy - where two fight the third one wins. It is, ladies and gentlemen, as simple as that.

    From writer Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Innocents) and director John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), this film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and that was good enough reason for me to watch it. Basically a group of international criminals: Peterson (Robert Morley), Julius O'Hara (Peter Lorre), Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) and Ravello (Marco Tulli) have to wait for their steamer to be repaired, so are stranded in Italy. They are joined by the Dannreuthers, Billy (Humphrey Bogart) and Maria (Gina Lollobrigida), who are posing as vacuum cleaner salespeople, but they actually plan to buy some land in Africa supposedly loaded with valuable uranium. There are people with apparently similar ideas, so it is all a big scheme that will see the most clever and determined brains get what they want in the end. This is apparently a spoof of the Huston adventure movies The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Also starring Jennifer Jones as Mrs. Gwendolen Chelm, Edward Underdown as Harry Chelm, James Bond's Bernard Lee as Insp. Jack Clayton, Mario Perrone as Purser on SS Nyanga and Aldo Silvani as Charles - Restaurant Manager. Bogart does reasonably well as the head of the gang, Jones gets some good moments, and as the sly villain Morley has some amusing scenes with his posh English accent coming in handy, the other well known stars do fine too. I will admit that I did not understand the full story, and I didn't find myself laughing at much, but the adventure element is okay, and there are some relatively amusing moments, I'm not sure why it would be considered a must see film, but it is an alright comedy thriller. Worth watching!

    "A fortune hunting couple (Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida) join forces with a derelict group of four men (Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard and Marco Tulli) to find a uranium rich plot of land in Africa. While waiting for their ship to depart from Italy, they run into another scheming couple (Edward Underdown and Jennifer Jones). Soon all eight characters are drawn together in a race to see who can claim the fortune for themselves," according to the folks at synopsis central... An interesting mix of characters is wasted in this directionless, poorly paced attempt at a spoofing detective spy stories - like John Huston's own "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) - and wife-swapping. The legendary star appears tired, especially next to Ms. Lollobrigida, and not completely "in" on the joke. Though wasted, Ms. Jones contributes the best characterization; at least, she realizes how to strike the correct tone. Brought in to salvage the project, writer Truman Capote contributes some subtle wit; but, the resulting humor seems more dependent on accidentally bad filmmaking as it is on intentional comedy. **** Beat the Devil (11/24/53) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Robert Morley

    I do like John Huston's films a lot, so I feel really bad about saying this, but I didn't like Beat the Devil that much. I do like most of the cinematography and production values, there are some very witty lines and there are some amusing scenes. And Beat the Devil has a great cast, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and especially a suitably sly Robert Morley are very good in their roles and have good comic timing. On the other hand, John Huston's direction didn't work for me, he is a terrific director but you can tell comedy isn't his forte and I didn't feel that his heart was completely in it. The pace is also sluggish in places, but the real let down was the story. If I had to sum up the story in one phrase, would convoluted mess suffice? I loved the idea of it and all, and it started off grand, but then suddenly there is too much going on and it is hard to follow. So overall, I guess it's worth the look but I wasn't enthused with it, sorry. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    This is a great example of well written script, great direction and great acting. Capote's comedic dialog is precious. Huston's directing is a good example of letting fine actors, act and the repartee between Bogart, Jones and the other players is smooth and effortless. Present day movie makers could take a lesson from how to construct a character-driven movie from this entertaining film and young actors should be obligated to observe how real professionals ply their craft. The romantic farces that we get know just feature good looking actors repeating script lines and adding little to the creative process. Reference any movie with Jennifer Aniston, Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey or any number of other young stars and compare what they do to how Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida run through this script and you will see what I mean. At some point one feels like they are in the movie instead of just watching it. My only regret is that the DVD I watched didn't have subtitles.

    As Hollywood production became ever more individualised, with writers-directors and producer directors working independently of the studios, there were many pictures which attacked Hollywood conventions themselves. In Beat the Devil writer-director John Huston gives us a farcical take upon the recurring heist-gone-wrong subgenre. The style now known as film noir may not have been fully defined and discussed until the 60s, but any keen-minded cinemagoer can recognise a trend. And if a trend can be recognised then it is open to parody. It looks however as if Beat the Devil may have begun life as a serious thriller. All the business about criminals going after uranium mines in Africa seems fairly original, and is certainly not an archetypal noir plot. And really there is no grand satire here, and no lampooning of specific genre clich&eacute;s. The story's premise is essentially serious, yet is written with comedy characters and comical mishaps along the way. It's if Huston and his co-writer Truman Capote simply gave up on following it through and instead decided to have a bit of fun with it. Nevertheless, Huston shoots this one with the same thoughtfulness and precision as he would a drama. As always, he favours set-ups which keep multiple actors in shot together, background and foreground, minimising on cuts between them. With some neat movements he is able to bring the right person to our attention at the right moment, for example the scene in which we first see Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida. Bogart paces back and forth in the foreground moving in and out of shot, while Lollobrigida is in mid-shot but sat in the same place, meaning the two of them take turns to be the focal point without lots of editing or obtrusive camera-work. Another neat touch is when the major approaches Bogart at the outdoor table, starting off in the background as if an extra, until it becomes apparent he is worth taking note of. Huston's technique is about elaborate arrangement to keep all characters involved and performances intact without the distractions of film form. And here there are many characters and performances worth looking at. As befitting for the tone, this is a real outing for oddball supporting players. Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There's a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled  often impeccably  by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema. There's also a great turn by Jennifer Jones, at her most comical and almost unrecognisable as an eccentric Englishwoman, showing superb comic timing as she casually beats her husband at chess. With so much scene-stealing going on, it's possible to forget this is ostensibly a Humphrey Bogart movie. But while Beat the Devil is full of quirky characters and has numerous funny little moments, it doesn't have much point beside that. The humour is never exactly hilarious because the whole thing really doesn't seem conceived as a comedy. There's not enough of the interaction between crazy characters and sane world which drives wild comedy (such as the Marx Brothers), because in Beat the Devil virtually everyone and everything is crazy. Meanwhile the only completely straight characters (Bogart and Lollobrigida) are simply dull marginalised figures who exist separately from the comedy yet don't have the strength to perk up their end of the movie. Overall it is just a chaotic mess that happens to be worth a chuckle here and there.

    Having much of the same talent as 1951's masterpiece "The African Queen", this film comes off as a total contradiction in its entirety, giving a dark view of humanity at its most amoral and laughing at it at the same time. A group of strangers are crowded together on a steamer and something shady is afoot. At first, you really can't figure out what's going on, because every time that the writers drop an important plot point, a distraction occurs which moves it into a different direction. The film is alternately wise and confusing, one moment with leading man Humphrey Bogart standing out with me where he is informed that Hitler and Mussolini like leaders will soon destroy the world. Bogart simply states that he would like another year or two to continue to be miserable. That statement applies to how many people seem to feel today, a cynical society in an ever increasing dangerous world where unhappiness seems to be a better option than total oblivion. Replacing Sydney Greenstreet as the villainous fat man, Robert Morley is a total contrast to his fearful missionary in "The African Queen". He's so instantly smarmy, you're surprised anybody even wants to be around him. Add in Peter Lorre (sadly a very undefined character) and two leading ladies (Jennifer Jones, highly resembling Vivien Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and the luscious Gina Lollobrigida, obviously somebody's "kept woman" here), and you have a dream cast. The remainder of the cast are cynical men who seem intent on creating more unhappiness, and while there are some surprising plot twists and sudden turns (people are believed to be dead, incorrectly it turns out) and everybody is in danger at all times. A ship's steward politely tells Bogart that the ship is sinking as if announcing dinner. It is obvious that John Huston had his tongue so far into his cheek he could taste last week's dinner, yet the inside joke wasn't let out on an unsuspecting public who, according to reviews, just didn't get it. I did, but it may not have been the filmmaker's ideas that I got, just my own visions of what the film said, at least to me. Along with another independently made Bogart film ("The Barefoot Contessa"), this is a film that doesn't necessarily work but with its star performances and a few dropped intelligent witticisms, can inspire some great thought. Otherwise, however, it is a pretentious bore.

    Humphrey Bogart is anything but suave. He looks silly with a feminine silk scarf beneath a dress shirt and blazer. He is also stiff as a comedic actor although I understand that he is the straight man who never utters a humorous line. The others are intended to be funny, but they don't pull it off too well, especially Robert Morley and Peter Lorre, who have been in comedies but are more believable as bad guys. Jennifer Jones is great, only because she was born in Tulsa, OK and does a fine job with a British accent, something most actors couldn't do in 1953. Still, she is not a comedic actress and that contributes to the mis-casting and the ultimate flatness of the film. The plot is weak and disorienting. I watched this film during a day-long TCM tribute to Bogart, and fortunately, it was played during my lunch hour. Perhaps, in eating lunch, I missed the point and the comedy, but I think NOT! The remainder of the films were excellent, however, I have to concede that I've seen these Bogart films many times, the most often being 'The Caine Mutiny' which I had to watch in college for an ROTC class and have been hooked on this film since. I continue to see something new with each viewing.

    This is a film that has be described as a " thriller , " a " comedy " A "romance " a " drama " and an " adventure " . In other words it has elements of being a cross genre movie . The cross genre movie was very popular in the 1980s when you'd get the likes of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and TOP GUN where the girls would flock to the cinema to swoon all over the hunky male star and get caught up in the on screen romance while boys would get involved in the macho culture of the military drama . In other words there's two distinct genres to the movie .Watching BEAT THE DEVIL you're aware there's no real distinct elements to the story There is indeed different elements at play here from a screenplay by Truman Capote but comes across as being very uneasy with itself as characters discuss love , fascism and other aspects of the human condition . This existentialist discussion might work very much better in a French New Wave movie but jars in a film that resembles a British B movie despite the exotic locations . For some reason everything has a dullness to it that one would never expect from Huston This is a film that seems more easier to market down to the casting rather than the storytelling . Humphrey Bogart was of course a screen legend but he seems to lack his usual charisma . People on this page have commentated that he looks ill and certainly you get the impression that his heart isn't in this movie . Indeed everyone involved has been much better in almost everything they've done and explains why BEAT THE DEVIL is relatively obscure when you think of the talent behind and in front of the screen

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort. Gwendolen is smitten with Billy, while Harry doesn't care much for him. On the other hand, Harry is smitten by Billy's seductive wife, Maria. Their steamer is delayed constantly, by a malfunctioning oil tank and a drunk captain. When Billy and one of his four acquaintances watch their car fall over a cliff, they are presumed dead, and one of the criminals lets Harry in on the secret, and Gwendolen confesses her love for Billy. When Billy and his acquaintance arrive back, everyone is confused, and then they get the call to board the steamer. It only gets more confusing, so I'll save you the trouble. When I finished Wise Blood, another Huston film, I was terribly perplexed. On one hand it was a very interesting film, on the other it left me cold, and confused. I didn't know how to review it, properly at least. I promised myself that if I ever came across a similarly perplexing film, I would think for a while before I wrote a review. When I first heard of this film, I immediately thought I would come across a similar situation. I mean, come on, have you heard the plot! Critically, it is also divisive. Roger Ebert placed it upon his Great Movies list, a list of the best films of all time, yet it has a 6.6 on IMDb. I was worried I would be overly confused by the plot and turned off by its craziness. What a surprise I found when I finished watching the film, and had a review already planned in my head. This film has been called a satire, but a satire of what? I cannot classify this as a satire, so what is it? The answer is very simple, it is an adventure film. I found myself laughing at many points, although it is not a comedy. It is certainly an odd film, yet it is entertaining to say the least and the tricky twists and turns of the plot are actually quite easy to follow. It seems like the whole cast is having a ball, with Bogart turning in the kind of cynical performance he is the master of. Jennifer Jones is blonde, and loving it. I haven't seen many films with her, so I can't quite judge her quality as an actress, but she is excellent as the devious Gwendolen Chelm. The typical English exterior is betrayed, as she reveals herself to be a scheming little devil with a voracious appetite, for love out side of her marriage. Peter Lorre, Robert Morely and Edward Underdown are all also excellent. The odd man, or should I say woman, out is Gina Lollobrigida. Her role as Bogart's young, sensuous Italian wife is certainly fine, but she seems to be in the wrong film. This may not be her fault, as it seems as if no one on this movie knew what they were going for. Her performance is a bit one note, which is never good, even in a adventurous romp like this film. To be fair she is never really given any stand out scenes. The screenplay seems incredibly muddled, yet it works in a very strange way. It seems that even working nights wasn't enough to stop Truman Capote from putting his own spin on the proceedings, and the dialog is one of the films strengths. Capote and Huston manage to keep the screenplay tight and lean, but some scenes could have been cut, and some are just unnecessary. This film can be found in the Public Domain, so the transfer isn't of the best quality. The cinematography is fair, but nothing truly stands out. The same can be said of the score, it works, but you don't find yourself humming it later on. The locations are beautiful and they work well for this type of story. Huston's direction reflects the tone of the story, relaxed, smooth and in control. It flows naturally, showing that Huston wasn't afraid to take it easy, while still remaining in command of his film. Overall, is it amazing? No, not really. Is it entertaining enough to serve as an enjoyable experience for 90 minutes? Yes, of course. It isn't thought-provoking. It isn't deeply psychological. It is entertaining, fast paced and likable. So yes, it's not bad. Beat the Devil, 1953, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones and Robert Morely. Directed by John Huston, 7.5/10 (B+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie. You can view this and other reviews at http://everyjohnhustonmovie.blogspot.ca/)

    I wanted to see this movie simply because I was somewhere in the middle of a Humphrey Bogart marathon. Truthfully, I must say that the main plot did not amaze right from the start. Even though the amount of great actors is really terrific, the performances that they give are, sadly, on a much lower level than they should be. Not one of the characters that we see (Billy Dannreuther and his wife, Mrs. Helm and her husband, and the four crooks) stand out from the group. One thing I can say about the four main characters - the crooks - is that their comedic appearances almost burst me into tears. If it was not for the fact that it is hard to attach this movie to one particular genre, and even the director was not sure what the final outcome was, I would have to say that this is one of the first parodies of a classical noir cinema. However, paradoxically, if it was meant to be a parody I would not say that it is truly a good one. That is what amazes me about this movie - you are not sure what kind of a flick you are watching, yet, if you want to categorize it becomes even less entertaining.

Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There's a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled  often impeccably  by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema. There's also a great turn by Jennifer Jones, at her most comical and almost unrecognisable as an eccentric Englishwoman, showing superb comic timing as she casually beats her husband at chess. With so much scene-stealing going on, it's possible to forget this is ostensibly a Humphrey Bogart movie. But while Beat the Devil is full of quirky characters and has numerous funny little moments, it doesn't have much point beside that. The humour is never exactly hilarious because the whole thing really doesn't seem conceived as a comedy. There's not enough of the interaction between crazy characters and sane world which drives wild comedy (such as the Marx Brothers), because in Beat the Devil virtually everyone and everything is crazy. Meanwhile the only completely straight characters (Bogart and Lollobrigida) are simply dull marginalised figures who exist separately from the comedy yet don't have the strength to perk up their end of the movie. Overall it is just a chaotic mess that happens to be worth a chuckle here and there.

    Having much of the same talent as 1951's masterpiece "The African Queen", this film comes off as a total contradiction in its entirety, giving a dark view of humanity at its most amoral and laughing at it at the same time. A group of strangers are crowded together on a steamer and something shady is afoot. At first, you really can't figure out what's going on, because every time that the writers drop an important plot point, a distraction occurs which moves it into a different direction. The film is alternately wise and confusing, one moment with leading man Humphrey Bogart standing out with me where he is informed that Hitler and Mussolini like leaders will soon destroy the world. Bogart simply states that he would like another year or two to continue to be miserable. That statement applies to how many people seem to feel today, a cynical society in an ever increasing dangerous world where unhappiness seems to be a better option than total oblivion. Replacing Sydney Greenstreet as the villainous fat man, Robert Morley is a total contrast to his fearful missionary in "The African Queen". He's so instantly smarmy, you're surprised anybody even wants to be around him. Add in Peter Lorre (sadly a very undefined character) and two leading ladies (Jennifer Jones, highly resembling Vivien Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and the luscious Gina Lollobrigida, obviously somebody's "kept woman" here), and you have a dream cast. The remainder of the cast are cynical men who seem intent on creating more unhappiness, and while there are some surprising plot twists and sudden turns (people are believed to be dead, incorrectly it turns out) and everybody is in danger at all times. A ship's steward politely tells Bogart that the ship is sinking as if announcing dinner. It is obvious that John Huston had his tongue so far into his cheek he could taste last week's dinner, yet the inside joke wasn't let out on an unsuspecting public who, according to reviews, just didn't get it. I did, but it may not have been the filmmaker's ideas that I got, just my own visions of what the film said, at least to me. Along with another independently made Bogart film ("The Barefoot Contessa"), this is a film that doesn't necessarily work but with its star performances and a few dropped intelligent witticisms, can inspire some great thought. Otherwise, however, it is a pretentious bore.

    Humphrey Bogart is anything but suave. He looks silly with a feminine silk scarf beneath a dress shirt and blazer. He is also stiff as a comedic actor although I understand that he is the straight man who never utters a humorous line. The others are intended to be funny, but they don't pull it off too well, especially Robert Morley and Peter Lorre, who have been in comedies but are more believable as bad guys. Jennifer Jones is great, only because she was born in Tulsa, OK and does a fine job with a British accent, something most actors couldn't do in 1953. Still, she is not a comedic actress and that contributes to the mis-casting and the ultimate flatness of the film. The plot is weak and disorienting. I watched this film during a day-long TCM tribute to Bogart, and fortunately, it was played during my lunch hour. Perhaps, in eating lunch, I missed the point and the comedy, but I think NOT! The remainder of the films were excellent, however, I have to concede that I've seen these Bogart films many times, the most often being 'The Caine Mutiny' which I had to watch in college for an ROTC class and have been hooked on this film since. I continue to see something new with each viewing.

    This is a film that has be described as a " thriller , " a " comedy " A "romance " a " drama " and an " adventure " . In other words it has elements of being a cross genre movie . The cross genre movie was very popular in the 1980s when you'd get the likes of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and TOP GUN where the girls would flock to the cinema to swoon all over the hunky male star and get caught up in the on screen romance while boys would get involved in the macho culture of the military drama . In other words there's two distinct genres to the movie .Watching BEAT THE DEVIL you're aware there's no real distinct elements to the story There is indeed different elements at play here from a screenplay by Truman Capote but comes across as being very uneasy with itself as characters discuss love , fascism and other aspects of the human condition . This existentialist discussion might work very much better in a French New Wave movie but jars in a film that resembles a British B movie despite the exotic locations . For some reason everything has a dullness to it that one would never expect from Huston This is a film that seems more easier to market down to the casting rather than the storytelling . Humphrey Bogart was of course a screen legend but he seems to lack his usual charisma . People on this page have commentated that he looks ill and certainly you get the impression that his heart isn't in this movie . Indeed everyone involved has been much better in almost everything they've done and explains why BEAT THE DEVIL is relatively obscure when you think of the talent behind and in front of the screen

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort. Gwendolen is smitten with Billy, while Harry doesn't care much for him. On the other hand, Harry is smitten by Billy's seductive wife, Maria. Their steamer is delayed constantly, by a malfunctioning oil tank and a drunk captain. When Billy and one of his four acquaintances watch their car fall over a cliff, they are presumed dead, and one of the criminals lets Harry in on the secret, and Gwendolen confesses her love for Billy. When Billy and his acquaintance arrive back, everyone is confused, and then they get the call to board the steamer. It only gets more confusing, so I'll save you the trouble. When I finished Wise Blood, another Huston film, I was terribly perplexed. On one hand it was a very interesting film, on the other it left me cold, and confused. I didn't know how to review it, properly at least. I promised myself that if I ever came across a similarly perplexing film, I would think for a while before I wrote a review. When I first heard of this film, I immediately thought I would come across a similar situation. I mean, come on, have you heard the plot! Critically, it is also divisive. Roger Ebert placed it upon his Great Movies list, a list of the best films of all time, yet it has a 6.6 on IMDb. I was worried I would be overly confused by the plot and turned off by its craziness. What a surprise I found when I finished watching the film, and had a review already planned in my head. This film has been called a satire, but a satire of what? I cannot classify this as a satire, so what is it? The answer is very simple, it is an adventure film. I found myself laughing at many points, although it is not a comedy. It is certainly an odd film, yet it is entertaining to say the least and the tricky twists and turns of the plot are actually quite easy to follow. It seems like the whole cast is having a ball, with Bogart turning in the kind of cynical performance he is the master of. Jennifer Jones is blonde, and loving it. I haven't seen many films with her, so I can't quite judge her quality as an actress, but she is excellent as the devious Gwendolen Chelm. The typical English exterior is betrayed, as she reveals herself to be a scheming little devil with a voracious appetite, for love out side of her marriage. Peter Lorre, Robert Morely and Edward Underdown are all also excellent. The odd man, or should I say woman, out is Gina Lollobrigida. Her role as Bogart's young, sensuous Italian wife is certainly fine, but she seems to be in the wrong film. This may not be her fault, as it seems as if no one on this movie knew what they were going for. Her performance is a bit one note, which is never good, even in a adventurous romp like this film. To be fair she is never really given any stand out scenes. The screenplay seems incredibly muddled, yet it works in a very strange way. It seems that even working nights wasn't enough to stop Truman Capote from putting his own spin on the proceedings, and the dialog is one of the films strengths. Capote and Huston manage to keep the screenplay tight and lean, but some scenes could have been cut, and some are just unnecessary. This film can be found in the Public Domain, so the transfer isn't of the best quality. The cinematography is fair, but nothing truly stands out. The same can be said of the score, it works, but you don't find yourself humming it later on. The locations are beautiful and they work well for this type of story. Huston's direction reflects the tone of the story, relaxed, smooth and in control. It flows naturally, showing that Huston wasn't afraid to take it easy, while still remaining in command of his film. Overall, is it amazing? No, not really. Is it entertaining enough to serve as an enjoyable experience for 90 minutes? Yes, of course. It isn't thought-provoking. It isn't deeply psychological. It is entertaining, fast paced and likable. So yes, it's not bad. Beat the Devil, 1953, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones and Robert Morely. Directed by John Huston, 7.5/10 (B+) (This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie. You can view this and other reviews at http://everyjohnhustonmovie.blogspot.ca/)

    I wanted to see this movie simply because I was somewhere in the middle of a Humphrey Bogart marathon. Truthfully, I must say that the main plot did not amaze right from the start. Even though the amount of great actors is really terrific, the performances that they give are, sadly, on a much lower level than they should be. Not one of the characters that we see (Billy Dannreuther and his wife, Mrs. Helm and her husband, and the four crooks) stand out from the group. One thing I can say about the four main characters - the crooks - is that their comedic appearances almost burst me into tears. If it was not for the fact that it is hard to attach this movie to one particular genre, and even the director was not sure what the final outcome was, I would have to say that this is one of the first parodies of a classical noir cinema. However, paradoxically, if it was meant to be a parody I would not say that it is truly a good one. That is what amazes me about this movie - you are not sure what kind of a flick you are watching, yet, if you want to categorize it becomes even less entertaining. Still, the plot is enjoyable, because of the obvious conflicts and scams overwhelming all of the greedy and suspicious characters. The events that occur in the three different places (Italy, ship and North Africa) are somewhat adorable, because of the comedic subplots. And in the end even the great old saying comes in handy - where two fight the third one wins. It is, ladies and gentlemen, as simple as that.

    From writer Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Innocents) and director John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), this film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and that was good enough reason for me to watch it. Basically a group of international criminals: Peterson (Robert Morley), Julius O'Hara (Peter Lorre), Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) and Ravello (Marco Tulli) have to wait for their steamer to be repaired, so are stranded in Italy. They are joined by the Dannreuthers, Billy (Humphrey Bogart) and Maria (Gina Lollobrigida), who are posing as vacuum cleaner salespeople, but they actually plan to buy some land in Africa supposedly loaded with valuable uranium. There are people with apparently similar ideas, so it is all a big scheme that will see the most clever and determined brains get what they want in the end. This is apparently a spoof of the Huston adventure movies The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Also starring Jennifer Jones as Mrs. Gwendolen Chelm, Edward Underdown as Harry Chelm, James Bond's Bernard Lee as Insp. Jack Clayton, Mario Perrone as Purser on SS Nyanga and Aldo Silvani as Charles - Restaurant Manager. Bogart does reasonably well as the head of the gang, Jones gets some good moments, and as the sly villain Morley has some amusing scenes with his posh English accent coming in handy, the other well known stars do fine too. I will admit that I did not understand the full story, and I didn't find myself laughing at much, but the adventure element is okay, and there are some relatively amusing moments, I'm not sure why it would be considered a must see film, but it is an alright comedy thriller. Worth watching!

    "A fortune hunting couple (Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida) join forces with a derelict group of four men (Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard and Marco Tulli) to find a uranium rich plot of land in Africa. While waiting for their ship to depart from Italy, they run into another scheming couple (Edward Underdown and Jennifer Jones). Soon all eight characters are drawn together in a race to see who can claim the fortune for themselves," according to the folks at synopsis central... An interesting mix of characters is wasted in this directionless, poorly paced attempt at a spoofing detective spy stories - like John Huston's own "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) - and wife-swapping. The legendary star appears tired, especially next to Ms. Lollobrigida, and not completely "in" on the joke. Though wasted, Ms. Jones contributes the best characterization; at least, she realizes how to strike the correct tone. Brought in to salvage the project, writer Truman Capote contributes some subtle wit; but, the resulting humor seems more dependent on accidentally bad filmmaking as it is on intentional comedy. **** Beat the Devil (11/24/53) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Robert Morley

    I do like John Huston's films a lot, so I feel really bad about saying this, but I didn't like Beat the Devil that much. I do like most of the cinematography and production values, there are some very witty lines and there are some amusing scenes. And Beat the Devil has a great cast, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and especially a suitably sly Robert Morley are very good in their roles and have good comic timing. On the other hand, John Huston's direction didn't work for me, he is a terrific director but you can tell comedy isn't his forte and I didn't feel that his heart was completely in it. The pace is also sluggish in places, but the real let down was the story. If I had to sum up the story in one phrase, would convoluted mess suffice? I loved the idea of it and all, and it started off grand, but then suddenly there is too much going on and it is hard to follow. So overall, I guess it's worth the look but I wasn't enthused with it, sorry. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    This is a great example of well written script, great direction and great acting. Capote's comedic dialog is precious. Huston's directing is a good example of letting fine actors, act and the repartee between Bogart, Jones and the other players is smooth and effortless. Present day movie makers could take a lesson from how to construct a character-driven movie from this entertaining film and young actors should be obligated to observe how real professionals ply their craft. The romantic farces that we get know just feature good looking actors repeating script lines and adding little to the creative process. Reference any movie with Jennifer Aniston, Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey or any number of other young stars and compare what they do to how Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida run through this script and you will see what I mean. At some point one feels like they are in the movie instead of just watching it. My only regret is that the DVD I watched didn't have subtitles.

    As Hollywood production became ever more individualised, with writers-directors and producer directors working independently of the studios, there were many pictures which attacked Hollywood conventions themselves. In Beat the Devil writer-director John Huston gives us a farcical take upon the recurring heist-gone-wrong subgenre. The style now known as film noir may not have been fully defined and discussed until the 60s, but any keen-minded cinemagoer can recognise a trend. And if a trend can be recognised then it is open to parody. It looks however as if Beat the Devil may have begun life as a serious thriller. All the business about criminals going after uranium mines in Africa seems fairly original, and is certainly not an archetypal noir plot. And really there is no grand satire here, and no lampooning of specific genre clich&eacute;s. The story's premise is essentially serious, yet is written with comedy characters and comical mishaps along the way. It's if Huston and his co-writer Truman Capote simply gave up on following it through and instead decided to have a bit of fun with it. Nevertheless, Huston shoots this one with the same thoughtfulness and precision as he would a drama. As always, he favours set-ups which keep multiple actors in shot together, background and foreground, minimising on cuts between them. With some neat movements he is able to bring the right person to our attention at the right moment, for example the scene in which we first see Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida. Bogart paces back and forth in the foreground moving in and out of shot, while Lollobrigida is in mid-shot but sat in the same place, meaning the two of them take turns to be the focal point without lots of editing or obtrusive camera-work. Another neat touch is when the major approaches Bogart at the outdoor table, starting off in the background as if an extra, until it becomes apparent he is worth taking note of. Huston's technique is about elaborate arrangement to keep all characters involved and performances intact without the distractions of film form. And here there are many characters and performances worth looking at. As befitting for the tone, this is a real outing for oddball supporting players. Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There's a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled  often impeccably  by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema.

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort.

I didn't know how to review it, properly at least. I promised myself that if I ever came across a similarly perplexing film, I would think for a while before I wrote a review. When I first heard of this film, I immediately thought I would come across a similar situation. I mean, come on, have you heard the plot! Critically, it is also divisive. Roger Ebert placed it upon his Great Movies list, a list of the best films of all time, yet it has a 6.6 on IMDb. I was worried I would be overly confused by the plot and turned off by its craziness. What a surprise I found when I finished watching the film, and had a review already planned in my head. This film has been called a satire, but a satire of what? I cannot classify this as a satire, so what is it? The answer is very simple, it is an adventure film. I found myself laughing at many points, although it is not a comedy. It is certainly an odd film, yet it is entertaining to say the least and the tricky twists and turns of the plot are actually quite easy to follow. It seems like the whole cast is having a ball, with Bogart turning in the kind of cynical performance he is the master of. Jennifer Jones is blonde, and loving it. I haven't seen many films with her, so I can't quite judge her quality as an actress, but she is excellent as the devious Gwendolen Chelm. The typical English exterior is betrayed, as she reveals herself to be a scheming little devil with a voracious appetite, for love out side of her marriage. Peter Lorre, Robert Morely and Edward Underdown are all also excellent. The odd man, or should I say woman, out is Gina Lollobrigida. Her role as Bogart's young, sensuous Italian wife is certainly fine, but she seems to be in the wrong film. This may not be her fault, as it seems as if no one on this movie knew what they were going for. Her performance is a bit one note, which is never good, even in a adventurous romp like this film. To be fair she is never really given any stand out scenes. The screenplay seems incredibly muddled, yet it works in a very strange way. It seems that even working nights wasn't enough to stop Truman Capote from putting his own spin on the proceedings, and the dialog is one of the films strengths. Capote and Huston manage to keep the screenplay tight and lean, but some scenes could have been cut, and some are just unnecessary. This film can be found in the Public Domain, so the transfer isn't of the best quality. The cinematography is fair, but nothing truly stands out. The same can be said of the score, it works, but you don't find yourself humming it later on. The locations are beautiful and they work well for this type of story. Huston's direction reflects the tone of the story, relaxed, smooth and in control. It flows naturally, showing that Huston wasn't afraid to take it easy, while still remaining in command of his film. Overall, is it amazing? No, not really. Is it entertaining enough to serve as an enjoyable experience for 90 minutes? Yes, of course. It isn't thought-provoking. It isn't deeply psychological. It is entertaining, fast paced and likable. So yes, it's not bad. Beat the Devil, 1953, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones and Robert Morely.

    I wanted to see this movie simply because I was somewhere in the middle of a Humphrey Bogart marathon. Truthfully, I must say that the main plot did not amaze right from the start. Even though the amount of great actors is really terrific, the performances that they give are, sadly, on a much lower level than they should be. Not one of the characters that we see (Billy Dannreuther and his wife, Mrs. Helm and her husband, and the four crooks) stand out from the group. One thing I can say about the four main characters - the crooks - is that their comedic appearances almost burst me into tears. If it was not for the fact that it is hard to attach this movie to one particular genre, and even the director was not sure what the final outcome was, I would have to say that this is one of the first parodies of a classical noir cinema. However, paradoxically, if it was meant to be a parody I would not say that it is truly a good one. That is what amazes me about this movie - you are not sure what kind of a flick you are watching, yet, if you want to categorize it becomes even less entertaining. Still, the plot is enjoyable, because of the obvious conflicts and scams overwhelming all of the greedy and suspicious characters. The events that occur in the three different places (Italy, ship and North Africa) are somewhat adorable, because of the comedic subplots. And in the end even the great old saying comes in handy - where two fight the third one wins. It is, ladies and gentlemen, as simple as that.

    From writer Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Innocents) and director John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), this film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and that was good enough reason for me to watch it. Basically a group of international criminals: Peterson (Robert Morley), Julius O'Hara (Peter Lorre), Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) and Ravello (Marco Tulli) have to wait for their steamer to be repaired, so are stranded in Italy. They are joined by the Dannreuthers, Billy (Humphrey Bogart) and Maria (Gina Lollobrigida), who are posing as vacuum cleaner salespeople, but they actually plan to buy some land in Africa supposedly loaded with valuable uranium. There are people with apparently similar ideas, so it is all a big scheme that will see the most clever and determined brains get what they want in the end. This is apparently a spoof of the Huston adventure movies The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Also starring Jennifer Jones as Mrs. Gwendolen Chelm, Edward Underdown as Harry Chelm, James Bond's Bernard Lee as Insp. Jack Clayton, Mario Perrone as Purser on SS Nyanga and Aldo Silvani as Charles - Restaurant Manager. Bogart does reasonably well as the head of the gang, Jones gets some good moments, and as the sly villain Morley has some amusing scenes with his posh English accent coming in handy, the other well known stars do fine too. I will admit that I did not understand the full story, and I didn't find myself laughing at much, but the adventure element is okay, and there are some relatively amusing moments, I'm not sure why it would be considered a must see film, but it is an alright comedy thriller. Worth watching!

    "A fortune hunting couple (Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida) join forces with a derelict group of four men (Robert Morley, Peter Lorre, Ivor Barnard and Marco Tulli) to find a uranium rich plot of land in Africa. While waiting for their ship to depart from Italy, they run into another scheming couple (Edward Underdown and Jennifer Jones). Soon all eight characters are drawn together in a race to see who can claim the fortune for themselves," according to the folks at synopsis central... An interesting mix of characters is wasted in this directionless, poorly paced attempt at a spoofing detective spy stories - like John Huston's own "The Maltese Falcon" (1941) - and wife-swapping. The legendary star appears tired, especially next to Ms. Lollobrigida, and not completely "in" on the joke. Though wasted, Ms. Jones contributes the best characterization; at least, she realizes how to strike the correct tone. Brought in to salvage the project, writer Truman Capote contributes some subtle wit; but, the resulting humor seems more dependent on accidentally bad filmmaking as it is on intentional comedy. **** Beat the Devil (11/24/53) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida, Robert Morley

    I do like John Huston's films a lot, so I feel really bad about saying this, but I didn't like Beat the Devil that much. I do like most of the cinematography and production values, there are some very witty lines and there are some amusing scenes. And Beat the Devil has a great cast, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and especially a suitably sly Robert Morley are very good in their roles and have good comic timing. On the other hand, John Huston's direction didn't work for me, he is a terrific director but you can tell comedy isn't his forte and I didn't feel that his heart was completely in it. The pace is also sluggish in places, but the real let down was the story. If I had to sum up the story in one phrase, would convoluted mess suffice? I loved the idea of it and all, and it started off grand, but then suddenly there is too much going on and it is hard to follow. So overall, I guess it's worth the look but I wasn't enthused with it, sorry. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    This is a great example of well written script, great direction and great acting. Capote's comedic dialog is precious. Huston's directing is a good example of letting fine actors, act and the repartee between Bogart, Jones and the other players is smooth and effortless. Present day movie makers could take a lesson from how to construct a character-driven movie from this entertaining film and young actors should be obligated to observe how real professionals ply their craft. The romantic farces that we get know just feature good looking actors repeating script lines and adding little to the creative process. Reference any movie with Jennifer Aniston, Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey or any number of other young stars and compare what they do to how Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida run through this script and you will see what I mean. At some point one feels like they are in the movie instead of just watching it. My only regret is that the DVD I watched didn't have subtitles.

    As Hollywood production became ever more individualised, with writers-directors and producer directors working independently of the studios, there were many pictures which attacked Hollywood conventions themselves. In Beat the Devil writer-director John Huston gives us a farcical take upon the recurring heist-gone-wrong subgenre. The style now known as film noir may not have been fully defined and discussed until the 60s, but any keen-minded cinemagoer can recognise a trend. And if a trend can be recognised then it is open to parody. It looks however as if Beat the Devil may have begun life as a serious thriller. All the business about criminals going after uranium mines in Africa seems fairly original, and is certainly not an archetypal noir plot. And really there is no grand satire here, and no lampooning of specific genre clich&eacute;s. The story's premise is essentially serious, yet is written with comedy characters and comical mishaps along the way. It's if Huston and his co-writer Truman Capote simply gave up on following it through and instead decided to have a bit of fun with it. Nevertheless, Huston shoots this one with the same thoughtfulness and precision as he would a drama. As always, he favours set-ups which keep multiple actors in shot together, background and foreground, minimising on cuts between them. With some neat movements he is able to bring the right person to our attention at the right moment, for example the scene in which we first see Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida. Bogart paces back and forth in the foreground moving in and out of shot, while Lollobrigida is in mid-shot but sat in the same place, meaning the two of them take turns to be the focal point without lots of editing or obtrusive camera-work. Another neat touch is when the major approaches Bogart at the outdoor table, starting off in the background as if an extra, until it becomes apparent he is worth taking note of. Huston's technique is about elaborate arrangement to keep all characters involved and performances intact without the distractions of film form. And here there are many characters and performances worth looking at. As befitting for the tone, this is a real outing for oddball supporting players. Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There's a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled  often impeccably  by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema. There's also a great turn by Jennifer Jones, at her most comical and almost unrecognisable as an eccentric Englishwoman, showing superb comic timing as she casually beats her husband at chess. With so much scene-stealing going on, it's possible to forget this is ostensibly a Humphrey Bogart movie. But while Beat the Devil is full of quirky characters and has numerous funny little moments, it doesn't have much point beside that. The humour is never exactly hilarious because the whole thing really doesn't seem conceived as a comedy. There's not enough of the interaction between crazy characters and sane world which drives wild comedy (such as the Marx Brothers), because in Beat the Devil virtually everyone and everything is crazy. Meanwhile the only completely straight characters (Bogart and Lollobrigida) are simply dull marginalised figures who exist separately from the comedy yet don't have the strength to perk up their end of the movie. Overall it is just a chaotic mess that happens to be worth a chuckle here and there.

    Having much of the same talent as 1951's masterpiece "The African Queen", this film comes off as a total contradiction in its entirety, giving a dark view of humanity at its most amoral and laughing at it at the same time. A group of strangers are crowded together on a steamer and something shady is afoot. At first, you really can't figure out what's going on, because every time that the writers drop an important plot point, a distraction occurs which moves it into a different direction. The film is alternately wise and confusing, one moment with leading man Humphrey Bogart standing out with me where he is informed that Hitler and Mussolini like leaders will soon destroy the world. Bogart simply states that he would like another year or two to continue to be miserable. That statement applies to how many people seem to feel today, a cynical society in an ever increasing dangerous world where unhappiness seems to be a better option than total oblivion. Replacing Sydney Greenstreet as the villainous fat man, Robert Morley is a total contrast to his fearful missionary in "The African Queen". He's so instantly smarmy, you're surprised anybody even wants to be around him. Add in Peter Lorre (sadly a very undefined character) and two leading ladies (Jennifer Jones, highly resembling Vivien Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and the luscious Gina Lollobrigida, obviously somebody's "kept woman" here), and you have a dream cast. The remainder of the cast are cynical men who seem intent on creating more unhappiness, and while there are some surprising plot twists and sudden turns (people are believed to be dead, incorrectly it turns out) and everybody is in danger at all times. A ship's steward politely tells Bogart that the ship is sinking as if announcing dinner. It is obvious that John Huston had his tongue so far into his cheek he could taste last week's dinner, yet the inside joke wasn't let out on an unsuspecting public who, according to reviews, just didn't get it. I did, but it may not have been the filmmaker's ideas that I got, just my own visions of what the film said, at least to me. Along with another independently made Bogart film ("The Barefoot Contessa"), this is a film that doesn't necessarily work but with its star performances and a few dropped intelligent witticisms, can inspire some great thought. Otherwise, however, it is a pretentious bore.

    Humphrey Bogart is anything but suave. He looks silly with a feminine silk scarf beneath a dress shirt and blazer. He is also stiff as a comedic actor although I understand that he is the straight man who never utters a humorous line. The others are intended to be funny, but they don't pull it off too well, especially Robert Morley and Peter Lorre, who have been in comedies but are more believable as bad guys. Jennifer Jones is great, only because she was born in Tulsa, OK and does a fine job with a British accent, something most actors couldn't do in 1953. Still, she is not a comedic actress and that contributes to the mis-casting and the ultimate flatness of the film. The plot is weak and disorienting. I watched this film during a day-long TCM tribute to Bogart, and fortunately, it was played during my lunch hour. Perhaps, in eating lunch, I missed the point and the comedy, but I think NOT! The remainder of the films were excellent, however, I have to concede that I've seen these Bogart films many times, the most often being 'The Caine Mutiny' which I had to watch in college for an ROTC class and have been hooked on this film since. I continue to see something new with each viewing.

    This is a film that has be described as a " thriller , " a " comedy " A "romance " a " drama " and an " adventure " . In other words it has elements of being a cross genre movie . The cross genre movie was very popular in the 1980s when you'd get the likes of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and TOP GUN where the girls would flock to the cinema to swoon all over the hunky male star and get caught up in the on screen romance while boys would get involved in the macho culture of the military drama . In other words there's two distinct genres to the movie .Watching BEAT THE DEVIL you're aware there's no real distinct elements to the story There is indeed different elements at play here from a screenplay by Truman Capote but comes across as being very uneasy with itself as characters discuss love , fascism and other aspects of the human condition . This existentialist discussion might work very much better in a French New Wave movie but jars in a film that resembles a British B movie despite the exotic locations . For some reason everything has a dullness to it that one would never expect from Huston This is a film that seems more easier to market down to the casting rather than the storytelling . Humphrey Bogart was of course a screen legend but he seems to lack his usual charisma . People on this page have commentated that he looks ill and certainly you get the impression that his heart isn't in this movie . Indeed everyone involved has been much better in almost everything they've done and explains why BEAT THE DEVIL is relatively obscure when you think of the talent behind and in front of the screen

    Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria are in Italy, planning to take a steamer to Africa, with four conniving criminals. They plan to buy land in Africa rich with uranium to exploit, and get rich off of it. When Billy wakes up one day, he finds that a man who had helped them with the plan was mysteriously killed in London. Going downstairs, he meets future fellow passengers, the Chelms; Gwendolen and Harry. Harry seems to be a stuffy Englishman, but his smart, attractive, blond wife is taken with Billy, and he invites them to dinner. They arrive at the restaurant a confused sort. Gwendolen is smitten with Billy, while Harry doesn't care much for him. On the other hand, Harry is smitten by Billy's seductive wife, Maria. Their steamer is delayed constantly, by a malfunctioning oil tank and a drunk captain. When Billy and one of his four acquaintances watch their car fall over a cliff, they are presumed dead, and one of the criminals lets Harry in on the secret, and Gwendolen confesses her love for Billy. When Billy and his acquaintance arrive back, everyone is confused, and then they get the call to board the steamer. It only gets more confusing, so I'll save you the trouble.

    I do like John Huston's films a lot, so I feel really bad about saying this, but I didn't like Beat the Devil that much. I do like most of the cinematography and production values, there are some very witty lines and there are some amusing scenes. And Beat the Devil has a great cast, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Jennifer Jones and especially a suitably sly Robert Morley are very good in their roles and have good comic timing. On the other hand, John Huston's direction didn't work for me, he is a terrific director but you can tell comedy isn't his forte and I didn't feel that his heart was completely in it. The pace is also sluggish in places, but the real let down was the story. If I had to sum up the story in one phrase, would convoluted mess suffice? I loved the idea of it and all, and it started off grand, but then suddenly there is too much going on and it is hard to follow. So overall, I guess it's worth the look but I wasn't enthused with it, sorry. 5/10 Bethany Cox

    This is a great example of well written script, great direction and great acting. Capote's comedic dialog is precious. Huston's directing is a good example of letting fine actors, act and the repartee between Bogart, Jones and the other players is smooth and effortless. Present day movie makers could take a lesson from how to construct a character-driven movie from this entertaining film and young actors should be obligated to observe how real professionals ply their craft. The romantic farces that we get know just feature good looking actors repeating script lines and adding little to the creative process. Reference any movie with Jennifer Aniston, Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey or any number of other young stars and compare what they do to how Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida run through this script and you will see what I mean. At some point one feels like they are in the movie instead of just watching it. My only regret is that the DVD I watched didn't have subtitles.

    As Hollywood production became ever more individualised, with writers-directors and producer directors working independently of the studios, there were many pictures which attacked Hollywood conventions themselves. In Beat the Devil writer-director John Huston gives us a farcical take upon the recurring heist-gone-wrong subgenre. The style now known as film noir may not have been fully defined and discussed until the 60s, but any keen-minded cinemagoer can recognise a trend. And if a trend can be recognised then it is open to parody. It looks however as if Beat the Devil may have begun life as a serious thriller. All the business about criminals going after uranium mines in Africa seems fairly original, and is certainly not an archetypal noir plot. And really there is no grand satire here, and no lampooning of specific genre clich&eacute;s. The story's premise is essentially serious, yet is written with comedy characters and comical mishaps along the way. It's if Huston and his co-writer Truman Capote simply gave up on following it through and instead decided to have a bit of fun with it. Nevertheless, Huston shoots this one with the same thoughtfulness and precision as he would a drama. As always, he favours set-ups which keep multiple actors in shot together, background and foreground, minimising on cuts between them. With some neat movements he is able to bring the right person to our attention at the right moment, for example the scene in which we first see Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollobrigida. Bogart paces back and forth in the foreground moving in and out of shot, while Lollobrigida is in mid-shot but sat in the same place, meaning the two of them take turns to be the focal point without lots of editing or obtrusive camera-work. Another neat touch is when the major approaches Bogart at the outdoor table, starting off in the background as if an extra, until it becomes apparent he is worth taking note of. Huston's technique is about elaborate arrangement to keep all characters involved and performances intact without the distractions of film form. And here there are many characters and performances worth looking at. As befitting for the tone, this is a real outing for oddball supporting players. Peter Lorre is at his very best, all shiftiness and lethargic mannerisms, while Robert Morley gleefully portrays his blustering and conspicuous opposite, and Ivor Barnard hams up his caricature of the puffed-up ex-army fascist. It appears these three fine character actors have been told to simply let go and play their familiar types to the hilt. By contrast, lesser-known Italian Marco Tulli gives a far more restrained performance, but he is in a way the funniest. There's a great moment somewhere in there while the other three are bickering and he is just sat in the middle of the shot, quietly blinking away like some daft meerkat. Even the tiniest roles are filled  often impeccably  by comedy players, many of whom are not well-known in English-language cinema. There's also a great turn by Jennifer Jones, at her most comical and almost unrecognisable as an eccentric Englishwoman, showing superb comic timing as she casually beats her husband at chess. With so much scene-stealing going on, it's possible to forget this is ostensibly a Humphrey Bogart movie. But while Beat the Devil is full of quirky characters and has numerous funny little moments, it doesn't have much point beside that. The humour is never exactly hilarious because the whole thing really doesn't seem conceived as a comedy. There's not enough of the interaction between crazy characters and sane world which drives wild comedy (such as the Marx Brothers), because in Beat the Devil virtually everyone and everything is crazy. Meanwhile the only completely straight characters (Bogart and Lollobrigida) are simply dull marginalised figures who exist separately from the comedy yet don't have the strength to perk up their end of the movie. Overall it is just a chaotic mess that happens to be worth a chuckle here and there.
