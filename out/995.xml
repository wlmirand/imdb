 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Warren has an extra room in his apartment (and is five months behind on the rent) after his lover moves out, so a friend places an ad on his behalf for a GWM roommate. Frankie, a pizza baker (and aspiring actor), decides to move out of his family's flat in The Bronx when he comes home one evening and walks in on his brother making love to Frankie's girlfriend. Frankie checks ads for roommates in "the city" (i.e., Manhattan), notices Warren's ad and decides to answer it, reasoning that GWM stands for "Guy With Money."

    This film is about a straight man looking for a room to rent, and he stumbles upon a room in a gay man's flat. After misinterpreting what GWM means, the pizza guy with Italian roots view a nice flat inhabited by a gay actor. Both these guys just had relationship troubles, and they both do not understand each others' lifestyles. After tolerance and understanding, they become great friends. Together with the fun supporting characters, and the numerous romantic entanglements, "Kiss Me Guido" is a fun, light hearted film that entertains. Though it's made with a small budget, it doesn't look cheap. the only thing that bothers me is the old fashioned hairstyles that do not age well.

    KISS ME GUIDO needs a re write and a remake. It is actually a funny premise fairly well executed, edited and cast...but with far too many stereotypes. Also the sound recording is not good at all. All these negatives still do not outweigh the fact that there is a good movie here waiting to be snazzed up into something played more into the galaxy of LA CAGE AUX FOLLES or PRISCILLA . As a low budget NY gay-ish camp/ Italian comedy it is simple and funny, but seems like a first draft that was made instead of reworking and reinventing and then snaring a better budget and bigger mindset. I like KISS ME GUIDO enough to give it a peck not a smooch. Maybe Tony Vitale can do as I suggest and boost the whole thing up a few octaves and make it bigger and louder and funnier and genuinely raucous. See NORMAN IS THAT YOU from 1976 for pointers....or THE (new musical version) PRODUCERS from Mel Brooks and go there.

    My feeling is that anything goes in a movie, if it is funny enough and clever enough, and it is not mean spirited. Unfortunately this movie is so lame and unfunny that the parade of annoying gay stereotypes (and for that matter straight) is unbearable. Yeah, there are guys like this, but I don't need to watch a dumb boring movie to experience it. Only the lead female character provides some relief from this. Yeah, she may be a stereotype too, but she provides some real comic characterization. This movie actually made me angry, and just contributes to the perception of gays as being funny entertainment for the masses. A total bomb.

    dumb, with broad stereotypes, but it was quite funny. I spent my first sixteen years in and Italian neighborhood in the Bronx, and the Italian guys are pretty on the mark. I found the gay guys a little too much of a stereotype, but not enough to ruin the film. I also think it is a mistake to call this a gay film. It is really a light comedy with a gay man and an Italian-American man. If you are looking for something PC with a strong social statement on being gay, don't bother with this film. If you have an open mind, time to kill, and want to laugh, this film is pretty good. And yes, I can believe some guy from the Bronx thinking that GWM means "guy with money."

Finally he gets this girl he likes, to meet him at his house but when Frankie walks in hes very angry (to put it lightly) to find this girl hes always wanted , in a very very different position from standing up and with his brother. He decides to move out and finds in the paper an apartment with GWM which Frankie stupidly thinks means guy with money when it actually means gay white male, Frankie turns up at the door and moves in then realizes that Warren and Terry are gay and decides to sell his ring and get his own apartment but then at the jewelers the man tells him its a fake diamond and hes only going to get $60 for it so Frankie decides to go back to the apartment until he gets work so he can move out. Warren at the start didn't like him due to the fact that 1 hes against gays and 2 he didn't put the ad in the paper terry did even though terry doesn't live there. Cut a very long story short Frankie gets some acting work from Warren's ex boyfriend and Warren starts forgetting about his ex boyfriend and starts to have his eye on Frankie even though Frankie isn't gay. Every thing gets knocked out of place when Warren and Frankie get a big of trouble wile practicing lines from a couple of nasty lads and Warren damages his foot trying to kick them, which means Frankie has to do Warren's parts and warrens ex boyfriend Dakota gets his new boyfriend to play the parts but when its half time Dakota has a big fall out with his boyfriend and Dakota is left to do the rest of Warrens parts and at the end there's a kissing scene in the play and Dakota tells Frankie to kiss him and ....... Frankie finally does *SPOILER BIT* at the end Warren gets in a huge fight because he doesn't want to go out with Dakota and Dakota becomes violent in front of everyone and he says to Warren that basically Warren and Frankie can't be anything because he isn't gay and he really goes violent and Frankie saves the day by kicking Dakota's ass and sends him to the floor (to put it lightly hehe) and him and Warren walk away. note: there's much more i didn't write about so don't think i wrote the whole story out!

    Pahtooey! 3 things you might learn from this festering helping of yuck-yuck: *Italian guys have great tans and work in their parents' pizza shops *Gay guys dress in drag and straight guys think they're really women *The best thing about gay films is usually one cute hetero guy on the boxcover And to think: Some Hollywood yitz dug this floppy flick enough to turn it into the FOX sitcom "Some Of My Best Friends" --a short-lived stinkbomb starring Jason Bateman that was responsible for Some Of Our Worst Nightmares. Do not rent this movie. Just say Uh-Uh, girl.

    Who could say no to a movie that provides something for everyone! You've got gays, straights, hot italian guys, pretty ladies, comedy and romance, and of course, Pizza! Sometimes I think that my mother is obsessed with this movie, then I watch it again and remember how cute it is.! Kiss Me Guido is a film about people and differences in a gorgeously wonderful package, through gay and NY Italian stereotypes. Nick Scotti (Frankie) and Anthony DeSando (Pino) fill that need for us girls (and guys) crazy for those italian stallion types with hot bodies. Anthony Barrile (Warren) is fabulous and I think that anyone can relate to Warren, searching for love, friends, and professional satisfaction. I personally really relate to Molly Price's Meryl-- not just because we share a first name-- Meryl is a great character and Price plays her with a perfect combination of sweetness and bitterness. I love to sit down and watch Kiss Me Guido on a Saturday with family and friends.

    I rented this movie after watching the preview for it on another movie and finding the whole concept hilarious. Ugh, this movie has a couple of really funny lines but after the first 30 minutes it falls totally flat, NOTHING happens at all. The only possible reason I could see to watch this is if you have to see every single movie with a plot containing openly gay characters, its really, really boring. 2 out of 10

    A dumb as bricks Italian Frankie (Nick Scotti) unwittingly moves in with a gay guy Warren (Anthony Barrile). He doesn't know Warren is gay--he thinks GWM means "guy with money"!! He finds out and gets along with Warren...but he knows his family and friends won't accept Warren. What to do? The jokes are obvious and there are some REALLY bad ones, but I still like this. It has stereotypes galore--Frankie's family especially. Frankie's dumb; his brother is seriously over-sexed (and dumb); his mother is fat, loud and obnoxious; his father is fat and always has stomach pains and the grandmother always dresses in black, is always at the kitchen table and doesn't speak a word of English! Warren is also stereotyped--his apartment is immaculate, he has art paintings all over the walls and he LOVES Julie Andrews. He also has a very queeny (and very funny) gay best friend. Still, I was giggling and laughing through this. The movie is so good-natured you can't be offended. And it IS a silly movie anyways. And it has a happy ending. The acting is all pretty good if a little shrill. Scotti especially comes off well. He's also very handsome and we get a few shots of his muscular chest. So, not good but fun. A true guilty favorite. Best line: "You threw up on your shirt".

    This movie isn't bad if you've got time to kill. I enjoyed it at least. The premise is good (Scotti thinks GWM means guy with money and winds up with a gay roommate), but could have been explored more. Nevertheless, I might recommend it. It all depends on taste. ** 1/2 out of ****

Cut a very long story short Frankie gets some acting work from Warren's ex boyfriend and Warren starts forgetting about his ex boyfriend and starts to have his eye on Frankie even though Frankie isn't gay. Every thing gets knocked out of place when Warren and Frankie get a big of trouble wile practicing lines from a couple of nasty lads and Warren damages his foot trying to kick them, which means Frankie has to do Warren's parts and warrens ex boyfriend Dakota gets his new boyfriend to play the parts but when its half time Dakota has a big fall out with his boyfriend and Dakota is left to do the rest of Warrens parts and at the end there's a kissing scene in the play and Dakota tells Frankie to kiss him and ....... Frankie finally does *SPOILER BIT* at the end Warren gets in a huge fight because he doesn't want to go out with Dakota and Dakota becomes violent in front of everyone and he says to Warren that basically Warren and Frankie can't be anything because he isn't gay and he really goes violent and Frankie saves the day by kicking Dakota's ass and sends him to the floor (to put it lightly hehe) and him and Warren walk away. note: there's much more i didn't write about so don't think i wrote the whole story out!

    Pahtooey! 3 things you might learn from this festering helping of yuck-yuck: *Italian guys have great tans and work in their parents' pizza shops *Gay guys dress in drag and straight guys think they're really women *The best thing about gay films is usually one cute hetero guy on the boxcover And to think: Some Hollywood yitz dug this floppy flick enough to turn it into the FOX sitcom "Some Of My Best Friends" --a short-lived stinkbomb starring Jason Bateman that was responsible for Some Of Our Worst Nightmares. Do not rent this movie. Just say Uh-Uh, girl.

    Who could say no to a movie that provides something for everyone! You've got gays, straights, hot italian guys, pretty ladies, comedy and romance, and of course, Pizza! Sometimes I think that my mother is obsessed with this movie, then I watch it again and remember how cute it is.! Kiss Me Guido is a film about people and differences in a gorgeously wonderful package, through gay and NY Italian stereotypes. Nick Scotti (Frankie) and Anthony DeSando (Pino) fill that need for us girls (and guys) crazy for those italian stallion types with hot bodies. Anthony Barrile (Warren) is fabulous and I think that anyone can relate to Warren, searching for love, friends, and professional satisfaction. I personally really relate to Molly Price's Meryl-- not just because we share a first name-- Meryl is a great character and Price plays her with a perfect combination of sweetness and bitterness. I love to sit down and watch Kiss Me Guido on a Saturday with family and friends.

    I rented this movie after watching the preview for it on another movie and finding the whole concept hilarious. Ugh, this movie has a couple of really funny lines but after the first 30 minutes it falls totally flat, NOTHING happens at all. The only possible reason I could see to watch this is if you have to see every single movie with a plot containing openly gay characters, its really, really boring. 2 out of 10

    A dumb as bricks Italian Frankie (Nick Scotti) unwittingly moves in with a gay guy Warren (Anthony Barrile). He doesn't know Warren is gay--he thinks GWM means "guy with money"!! He finds out and gets along with Warren...but he knows his family and friends won't accept Warren. What to do? The jokes are obvious and there are some REALLY bad ones, but I still like this. It has stereotypes galore--Frankie's family especially. Frankie's dumb; his brother is seriously over-sexed (and dumb); his mother is fat, loud and obnoxious; his father is fat and always has stomach pains and the grandmother always dresses in black, is always at the kitchen table and doesn't speak a word of English! Warren is also stereotyped--his apartment is immaculate, he has art paintings all over the walls and he LOVES Julie Andrews. He also has a very queeny (and very funny) gay best friend. Still, I was giggling and laughing through this. The movie is so good-natured you can't be offended. And it IS a silly movie anyways. And it has a happy ending. The acting is all pretty good if a little shrill. Scotti especially comes off well. He's also very handsome and we get a few shots of his muscular chest. So, not good but fun. A true guilty favorite. Best line: "You threw up on your shirt".

    This movie isn't bad if you've got time to kill. I enjoyed it at least. The premise is good (Scotti thinks GWM means guy with money and winds up with a gay roommate), but could have been explored more. Nevertheless, I might recommend it. It all depends on taste. ** 1/2 out of ****
