    This one hit close to home with me, especially with the characters. Chucho is a fun character that seemed to just be chased by bad luck, and some Hispanics, especially the older ones, are extremely superstitious. But it was funny how close the Chucho character was to the character that same actor played on "La Bamba." And Jimmy... well, that character brings so many memories of one of my cousins life... who has been in and out of prison... he's crude, rude, and can be ruthless, but will help you any way he can, especially if you're family. As a filmmaker, I'm hoping to bring a non-integrated part 2 to this, but the background of the adventure of my lineage is exciting on both father and mother's side. It'll be filled with the unexplained, the pain and drama, Spanish royal connections, and treasure.... which still remains hidden to this day.

    This movie is by far one of the best Latino stories I have ever seen. True, the movie does use stereotypes (such as Jimmy and his prison life) Chuco and his gang life which eventually leads to his death, and of course who can forget the backyard wedding and the large family living in a small home. However, this movie is not meant to be a representation of ALL Latino's everywhere, rather its meant to merely tell one families story and struggles in the United States. The comments stating "This movie does not represent Latinos everywhere!!" are absolutely correct. And it does not represent Latinos, but it does help you learn about one family you learn to almost care about by the end of the film. Going back to the story itself, I can honestly say that the movie itself was very well made. Jimmy Smits performance was superb and the movie was very focused on all the family members. The film provides a sense of hope at the end, basically trying to get across that while life is full of problems they are manageable. Also, the fact that the movie also involved a different Latino culture, such as the Central American Isabel helped viewers understand that even among Latino's there are differences in cultures. I would definitely recommend this movie to someone willing to learn about one Mexican American families struggle.

    I did not expect to enjoy this film as much as I did. From what it sounded like, it was another drama about how a family struggles to stay together, and it was, but it was a very entertaining one. The movie follows various members of a family around through the years 1926 to 1980. I'd almost classify this as an anthology because of many different story lines based around various members of the family. The first story is Jose Sanchez's struggle to get in to the United States, and how he met Maria (when younger played by Jennifer Lopez). The second story, set 25 years later, is about daughter Irene's wedding and son Chucho's gang life. The third story, set another 20 years later, is about son Jimmy and when he gets out of prison, gets married, has a son, goes back in prison and tries to make up with his 5 year old estranged son raised by his grandparents. I wouldn't say that this is Acadamy Award material but it is still a very compelling story that had me wanting to know more about the family as the stories progressed. My rating: *** out of ****. 122 mins. R for a scene of violence, sex, language.

    This film is all clich&eacute;. The depiction of Latino groups is demeaning. The reflection of white army,police as insensitive and brutal is such a stereotype. The uptight white family meeting the future in-laws in the local family house with roosters and chickens running in the streets and the white family so uncomfortable is another overdone scene.There are some positives-the cinematography was good in various spots.The overall passage of time was not well structured and some of the events depicted were impossible to occur. All in all this film is pandering to the Latino groups and delivers no suspense,true character development or interest. I rate this a thumbs down!

    "My mother believed everyone who got out of the house left something on the empty chairs," or something like this the narrator gives us. It seems that director Nava has watched a few hundred movies, and picked out one or two things from each of them. Be ready for a bunch of clich&eacute;'s, as in words, situations and play. Maybe when you've not seen that much it will be a joy to watch. If you've seen the same films as Nava, it's getting harder. Me and my wife couldn't help sighing out loud with another birth or death. The Oscar was for make-up. As in an old Dutch pop record: "You mind about your make up, but you better make up your mind."

    Mi Familia is a mini masterpiece. It uses all manner of genre styles to tell its story and amazingly it works. This is a film with so much passion and significance it is almost tiring to praise it for fear of running out of breath. You could call this film an epic or a saga since it deals with many generations of the same family. The film never shies away from making a social comment or two and deals directly with the issues at hand in whatever time period it happens to take place in. The family has never had an easy life, but the closing statement rings true in that despite the hardships they have been made to endure they have lead an incredibly good life. More than twice this family is broken up by the racial hatred and civilly unjust policies of their times, but they always stick together and no matter what happens or who does what this family is truly unbreakable. All performances are fantastic but there is one the really sticks out. Jimmy Smits has proved time and again that he is a capable actor but his work in this film is simply amazing.

    Contains Spoiler I really love this movie so much I bought the DVD. Edward James Olmos is so good as the father of the family. He acts just like my father used to when we were that age of the people in the movie. In fact, all the acting is really very good. The music in this movie is very authentic. The struggles of the family over so many years really made me cry at times -- what they went through was really so tough. The Mexican countryside is also very authentic too from what I can remember of it. Also, the part where the mother was having a baby, only she died instead -- that was really very good too -- and also reminded me of some people I used to know back when we lived in Mexico. This is a really terrific movie especially if you are also Latino actually.

    'My Family' is a compelling tale spanning three generations about a family of Mexican origin living in Los Angeles. It starts with the father of the family, Jose Sanchez (terrifically played by Jacob Vargas), making a one year journey on foot from Mexico to Los Angeles. Once there, he meets and marries the love of his life, Maria (Jennifer Lopez, in an interesting performance). After, Maria survives a tragic separation from her husband, they both settle down in Los Angeles and raise a family of six. There is a tremendous amount of expectation here, namely because Francis Ford Coppola, who crafted arguably the most exhilarating family saga in the Godfather pictures, is an executive producer. But, My Family is nowhere near in the same league as films like 'The Godfather'. Rather, 'My Family' turns out to be a great film that could have been better. One glaring flaw is in the script written by Gregory Nava and Anna Thomas. Too often, the script relies on tragedies to stir our emotions. Consequently, the emotion presented in the film feels fake at times. Particularly, in the scenes involving Jimmy attempting to bond with his only son, Carlitos. Despite the missteps in the film, there are many positives to draw upon. The strong performances of the cast. Jimmy Smits, in particular, dominates the film with an intense and yet affecting performance. The film hardly ever succumbs to being a standard tear-jerker or phony. Instead, the film succeeds at creating a touching and provocative portrait of a family's struggles and tribulations in a world that hardly seems just. Rating: (8/10)

    Movie follows Jose and Maria who emigrate to California in the 1920s, fall in love and get married. It follows their lives and their childrens up to 1995. An epic--the first American movie to show a multigenerational portrait of a Mexican family. It's not perfect--some parts are romanticized (I find it hard to believe that the house of a pretty poor family looks that good) and some of the situations are really melodramatic. Still, the script is good and believable and (with one exception) all the acting is good--especially the very talented Esai Morales. His was a very cliched role (the hot headed Latino brother) but he gave it depth and feeling and acted the hell out of it. When his character goes away the movie lost something. Unfortunately he's replaced by Jimmy Smits who gives a real terrible performance--he's so emotionless all the time! His prescence really drags down the last section of the film, but all the other actors keep it going. This definetely looks like the inspiration for the (unfortunately) cancelled Showtime series "Resurrection Blvd". It's just a little better than the series and some of the same actors appear in both (Morales played a hot-headed latino in the series too). Engrossing and one of a kind. Also it's kind of fun to see Jennifer Lopez in a small role before she hit it big. A definete must-see...it doesn't matter if you're Latino or not.
