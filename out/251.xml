    Masayuki Suo has produced a melodramatic story set in Japan that features ballroom dancing. Neither would particularly appeal however the film is elevated by a combination of depth, comedy featuring Aoki San and scenes shot in Blackpool! The most impressive aspect of this movie is how all of the characters come to life. Nearly 15 years after its release, its only now that I have had the pleasure of seeing it. The story focuses on a man undergoing a mid-life crisis who spontaneously takes up ballroom dancing. The film proceeds to follow the characters who make up the dance class. I am sometimes amazed how we can interpret characters in a film just by their physical appearance. For example Tamako Sensei is the forgiving type of person that she appears! Also Macho is the sleazy type of dancer that he appears! They wouldn't need to do or say anything and I would still conclude the same. Pros - Every single thing plus Aoki San Cons - The score is occasionally heavy handed Overall - 11 out of 10

    What makes "Casablanca" the great movie it is is that it doesn't try to tell the history of the world; it is not an epic; it is a perfectly polished little gem, "the problems of three little people" told exquisitely. "Shall We Dance" is such a polished gem. Set in the Japanese culture where all dancing is suspect, a middle-class middle-management man who has lost the luster of his life sees a beautiful young woman looking wistfully out the window of a dance studio and, eventually, goes looking for her. He finds much, much more. Does infidelity ensue? You'll have to decide for yourself. What does ensue is magic, not Harry Potter magic, the everyday ordinary kind of magic that makes the world of us common people so wonderfully worth living. I've said enough. There is so much sparkle to this gem throughout I feel as if nearly everything I want to tell you is a spoiler. See this movie. You owe it to yourself. You'll thank me.

    I saw the American cut of this Japanese movie, which has several scenes and characters removed. At that, "Shall We Dance" is a charming movie with tons of heart. Written and directed by Masayuki Suo, "Shall We Dance" has something "Strictly Ballroom" lacks: depth and feeling. I'll compare Baz Luhrman with Oscar Wilde: all flash and showy surface, with nothing underneath. Masayuki Suo has created a film with characters who move us. Koji Yakusho, Naoto Takenaka, Naoto Takenaka, and the other actors are excellent in their roles. The gist of the plot is that Mr. Sugiyama (Yakusho) is an overworked salaryman who spies a lovely younger woman in the window of a dance studio on his way home from work on the train. He has a wife, a daughter, and a mortgage, and no dreams. He takes up ballroom dancing to meet the younger woman, whose father owns the studio and who gives lessons. Dancing, of course, becomes a metaphor, and his fellow students grow from awkward, nameless bumblers to awkward, feeling humans as he (and we) learn to know them. The changes in the minor characters are more dramatic than the subtle growth of Mr. Sugiyama. In "Shall We Dance," learning dance means proceeding from our awkward, graceless first steps to feeling the music and trusting your partner. Feeling emotion and trusting your partner and yourself go hand in hand with learning the dance. The process gets a little heavy-handed as characters spell it out for us, but it didn't detract from the emotional investment we make in watching the characters grow. The movie is often funny without being a comedy, and it's not a romance with budding young love -- Mr. Sugiyama is in his forties, and his dream girl has no romantic interest in him. But they develop a relationship on another, still meaningful level. "Shall We Dance" is also the title of a 1937 Astaire-Rogers film, and the Japanese version was remade under the same title in 2004, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. I have not seen either of these two movies.

    Fabulous! Heart-warming! It's lovely film to watch. It's in slow drive with a slow build-up so don't expect any high-flouting gushy-type scenes. It's one of the few films that well demonstrates the gradualness and step- by-step approach involved of learning a new skill. The novice dancers don't become suddenly flamboyant  they awkwardly move along. The main actor is wonderful and under-stated. I suppose he represents all us guys who are just too shy and inhibited to start to dance. There are some nice sub-plots  eclectic dancers, detectives and a daughter who steps in at the proper times. All and all a life-affirming film!

    Shall We Dance is about a bored accountant Sugiyama,who on his evening commute,always looks at the beautiful woman who gazes wistfully out the window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing. One night he gets off the train, walks into the studio, and signs up for a class. Soon Sugiyama is so engrossed in his dancing he practices his steps on the train platform and under his desk, and becomes good enough for competition, compelling his wife to hire a private investigator to find out why he stays out late and returns home smelling of perfume. Among the colorful characters Sugiyama meets is his coworker Aoki,who transforms himself from geeky systems analyst to hilariously flamboyant (and bad-wigged) lounge lizard. Aoki explains to Sugiyama, "When I finish work, put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns, Latin world champion, and I start to move to the rhythm, I'm so happy, so completely free." Here lies the chief charm of Shall We Dance, the contrast between the ultra-competitive women of the studio--including the one who caught Sugiyama's eye, Mai --and the men who dance simply because they enjoy it. This is a great film tackles issues such as the views on men in the Japanese culture,mid-life crisis and ballroom dancing.The cast in the film were excellent.This is one of the best Japanese films I have ever seen.And it is not a horror film.It takes into consideration the pains of middle-age and the need to feel alive during that stage. Overall,it is the best non-horror Japanese film I have ever seen. Highly recommended to everyone who wants an entertaining movie.

    As I understand it, much of the humor in "Shall We Dance?" derives from the stereotype of the Japanese businessman. A businessman in the Land of the Rising Sun is supposed to be very serious and motivated, as Shohei Sugiyama (Kōji Yakusho) is. He's successful but unfulfilled. But taking dancing lessons just might change that. Much like Baz Luhrmann's "Strictly Ballroom", "Shall We Dance?" shows that dancing is a physical form of communication. Shohei feels cut off from his wife and daughter, but the dance lessons help him open up. The movie knows how to present everything just right so that it comes across naturally and without seeming like a clich&eacute;. There was an American remake, but I have no plans to ever see that one.

    A Japanese salaryman (Koji Yakusho) feeling jaded by work and bored with his family life, joins a ballroom dancing class. Shall We Dance? is a delightful comedy, dealing with a modest, humble man's search for exuberance, spontaneity and passion in a life he finds restrained and crushing. It has a sweetness that is remarkably unforced. The film performed strongly in American theaters earning roughly $9.7 million during its US release. At the Japanese Academy Awards it won 14 awards, every award it was eligible to win. A disastrous American remake, starring Richard Gere, was released in 2004.

    Dancing: The vertical expression of a horizontal desire legalised by music. This quote may have been in the mind of middle aged salaryman Shohei (Kaji Yakusho) who realises that his life is unfulfilled as he watches dance instructor Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari) every night from his commuter train. In a moment of impulsiveness, he signs up for dance lessons to be near the sphinx like Mai. This might have been a movie about the budding romance between the somewhat improbably beautiful leads. Instead director Masayuki Suo focuses more on the excitement and passion of the ballroom than the attraction between Shohei and Mai, and makes a better, less predictable movie for it. Both the lead and supporting roles are played to near perfection, though Naoto Takenaka as the troll like Latin wannabe Mr. Aoki, shamelessly steals every scene he is in. Will Shoheis horizontal aspirations be fulfilled? Will his irredeemably dull wife discover his guilty secret? Will he go to the ball? You can be reassured that these questions will be answered to your satisfaction by the end of this endearingly sweet movie.

    Shall We Dance? (Japan, 1996) opens to the tune of the same title, from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical and movie, The King and I. We are in a ballroom of the Blackpool Tower, England, home to a complex of buildings that host the most prestigious of international ballroom dancing competitions. A Japanese narrator draws a contrast to his own country: "In Japan, ballroom dance is regarded with much suspicion. In a country where married couples don't go out arm in arm, much less say, 'I love you' out loud, intuitive understanding is everything. The idea that a husband and wife should embrace and dance in front of others is beyond embarrassing. However, to go out dancing with someone else would be misunderstood and prove more shameful. Nonetheless, even for Japanese people, there is a secret wonder about the joys that dance can bring." Here and there, the wonder has been inspired by Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr from the Rodgers & Hammerstein film production. Other adventurous Japanese, by whatever means, have likewise been drawn to the ballroom dance floor. For Mr. Sugiyama, a middle-aged accountant with a wife and daughter, it begins at a commuter train stop where he spies a young woman looking out the upper-story window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing, and is captivated. This leads to lessons. Koji Yakusho is exceptional in the lead acting role. Tamiyo Kusakari plays the young woman from the window, who turns out to be a professional with aspirations to return to Blackpool. Reiko Kusamura is excellent as the very patient, somewhat older woman who ends up as the instructor of Mr. Sugiyama and his two nearly as clumsy male classmates. This is one of the all-time bests from among Japanese movies, particularly those of the non-samurai genre. Richard Gere starred in an Americanized version in 2004, but the Japanese original scores higher with IMDb ratings voters. If it suits your fancy, explore also the very funny Australian comedy-romance, Strictly Ballroom (1992).

    This is the original Shall We Dansu, a Japanese film that takes a look at the society around it and the shameful act of dancing. It is considered out of the society's norms to dance, whether it is in a studio or at home, especially ballroom dancing. This is exactly what the main character Shohei Sugiyama is looking for to break from his mundane life. While the topic of the film is better understood with the knowledge of Japanese culture it is still hilarious to watch while still maintaining its heart-felt plot. Shall We Dansu has a very serious plot of a man trying to break from his daily routine, but also adds in a slew of comedy through gags and dialog. Some scenes are laugh out loud while others just give a chuckle to break up tension. However, this is a very funny film with a very interesting story line. The one thing to be aware of is that this is the original Japanese version. There has been a more recent Hollywood version that falls very short in comparison. The Hollywood version was a flop and took an amazing movie and turned it into a pointless waste of time. Do not see the remake; instead look at this original film, which is able to captivate humor and drama all in the same moment. The most important thing to understand about this film is that in this Japanese society it is taboo to dance. If you try to place this film outside of that context, like how the remake attempted, it loses everything that makes this film worth seeing. While analyzing society, and the norms of that society, Shall We Dansu is a captivating experience that mixes humor with drama to allow for an entertaining film experience.

Do not see the remake; instead look at this original film, which is able to captivate humor and drama all in the same moment. The most important thing to understand about this film is that in this Japanese society it is taboo to dance. If you try to place this film outside of that context, like how the remake attempted, it loses everything that makes this film worth seeing. While analyzing society, and the norms of that society, Shall We Dansu is a captivating experience that mixes humor with drama to allow for an entertaining film experience.

    Masayuki Suo has produced a melodramatic story set in Japan that features ballroom dancing. Neither would particularly appeal however the film is elevated by a combination of depth, comedy featuring Aoki San and scenes shot in Blackpool! The most impressive aspect of this movie is how all of the characters come to life. Nearly 15 years after its release, its only now that I have had the pleasure of seeing it. The story focuses on a man undergoing a mid-life crisis who spontaneously takes up ballroom dancing. The film proceeds to follow the characters who make up the dance class. I am sometimes amazed how we can interpret characters in a film just by their physical appearance. For example Tamako Sensei is the forgiving type of person that she appears! Also Macho is the sleazy type of dancer that he appears! They wouldn't need to do or say anything and I would still conclude the same. Pros - Every single thing plus Aoki San Cons - The score is occasionally heavy handed Overall - 11 out of 10

    What makes "Casablanca" the great movie it is is that it doesn't try to tell the history of the world; it is not an epic; it is a perfectly polished little gem, "the problems of three little people" told exquisitely. "Shall We Dance" is such a polished gem. Set in the Japanese culture where all dancing is suspect, a middle-class middle-management man who has lost the luster of his life sees a beautiful young woman looking wistfully out the window of a dance studio and, eventually, goes looking for her. He finds much, much more. Does infidelity ensue? You'll have to decide for yourself. What does ensue is magic, not Harry Potter magic, the everyday ordinary kind of magic that makes the world of us common people so wonderfully worth living. I've said enough. There is so much sparkle to this gem throughout I feel as if nearly everything I want to tell you is a spoiler. See this movie. You owe it to yourself. You'll thank me.

    I saw the American cut of this Japanese movie, which has several scenes and characters removed. At that, "Shall We Dance" is a charming movie with tons of heart. Written and directed by Masayuki Suo, "Shall We Dance" has something "Strictly Ballroom" lacks: depth and feeling. I'll compare Baz Luhrman with Oscar Wilde: all flash and showy surface, with nothing underneath. Masayuki Suo has created a film with characters who move us. Koji Yakusho, Naoto Takenaka, Naoto Takenaka, and the other actors are excellent in their roles. The gist of the plot is that Mr. Sugiyama (Yakusho) is an overworked salaryman who spies a lovely younger woman in the window of a dance studio on his way home from work on the train. He has a wife, a daughter, and a mortgage, and no dreams. He takes up ballroom dancing to meet the younger woman, whose father owns the studio and who gives lessons. Dancing, of course, becomes a metaphor, and his fellow students grow from awkward, nameless bumblers to awkward, feeling humans as he (and we) learn to know them. The changes in the minor characters are more dramatic than the subtle growth of Mr. Sugiyama. In "Shall We Dance," learning dance means proceeding from our awkward, graceless first steps to feeling the music and trusting your partner. Feeling emotion and trusting your partner and yourself go hand in hand with learning the dance. The process gets a little heavy-handed as characters spell it out for us, but it didn't detract from the emotional investment we make in watching the characters grow. The movie is often funny without being a comedy, and it's not a romance with budding young love -- Mr. Sugiyama is in his forties, and his dream girl has no romantic interest in him. But they develop a relationship on another, still meaningful level. "Shall We Dance" is also the title of a 1937 Astaire-Rogers film, and the Japanese version was remade under the same title in 2004, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. I have not seen either of these two movies.

    Fabulous! Heart-warming! It's lovely film to watch. It's in slow drive with a slow build-up so don't expect any high-flouting gushy-type scenes. It's one of the few films that well demonstrates the gradualness and step- by-step approach involved of learning a new skill. The novice dancers don't become suddenly flamboyant  they awkwardly move along. The main actor is wonderful and under-stated. I suppose he represents all us guys who are just too shy and inhibited to start to dance. There are some nice sub-plots  eclectic dancers, detectives and a daughter who steps in at the proper times. All and all a life-affirming film!

    Shall We Dance is about a bored accountant Sugiyama,who on his evening commute,always looks at the beautiful woman who gazes wistfully out the window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing. One night he gets off the train, walks into the studio, and signs up for a class. Soon Sugiyama is so engrossed in his dancing he practices his steps on the train platform and under his desk, and becomes good enough for competition, compelling his wife to hire a private investigator to find out why he stays out late and returns home smelling of perfume. Among the colorful characters Sugiyama meets is his coworker Aoki,who transforms himself from geeky systems analyst to hilariously flamboyant (and bad-wigged) lounge lizard. Aoki explains to Sugiyama, "When I finish work, put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns, Latin world champion, and I start to move to the rhythm, I'm so happy, so completely free." Here lies the chief charm of Shall We Dance, the contrast between the ultra-competitive women of the studio--including the one who caught Sugiyama's eye, Mai --and the men who dance simply because they enjoy it. This is a great film tackles issues such as the views on men in the Japanese culture,mid-life crisis and ballroom dancing.The cast in the film were excellent.This is one of the best Japanese films I have ever seen.And it is not a horror film.It takes into consideration the pains of middle-age and the need to feel alive during that stage. Overall,it is the best non-horror Japanese film I have ever seen. Highly recommended to everyone who wants an entertaining movie.

    As I understand it, much of the humor in "Shall We Dance?" derives from the stereotype of the Japanese businessman. A businessman in the Land of the Rising Sun is supposed to be very serious and motivated, as Shohei Sugiyama (Kōji Yakusho) is. He's successful but unfulfilled. But taking dancing lessons just might change that. Much like Baz Luhrmann's "Strictly Ballroom", "Shall We Dance?" shows that dancing is a physical form of communication. Shohei feels cut off from his wife and daughter, but the dance lessons help him open up. The movie knows how to present everything just right so that it comes across naturally and without seeming like a clich&eacute;. There was an American remake, but I have no plans to ever see that one.

    A Japanese salaryman (Koji Yakusho) feeling jaded by work and bored with his family life, joins a ballroom dancing class. Shall We Dance? is a delightful comedy, dealing with a modest, humble man's search for exuberance, spontaneity and passion in a life he finds restrained and crushing. It has a sweetness that is remarkably unforced. The film performed strongly in American theaters earning roughly $9.7 million during its US release. At the Japanese Academy Awards it won 14 awards, every award it was eligible to win. A disastrous American remake, starring Richard Gere, was released in 2004.

    Dancing: The vertical expression of a horizontal desire legalised by music. This quote may have been in the mind of middle aged salaryman Shohei (Kaji Yakusho) who realises that his life is unfulfilled as he watches dance instructor Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari) every night from his commuter train. In a moment of impulsiveness, he signs up for dance lessons to be near the sphinx like Mai. This might have been a movie about the budding romance between the somewhat improbably beautiful leads. Instead director Masayuki Suo focuses more on the excitement and passion of the ballroom than the attraction between Shohei and Mai, and makes a better, less predictable movie for it. Both the lead and supporting roles are played to near perfection, though Naoto Takenaka as the troll like Latin wannabe Mr. Aoki, shamelessly steals every scene he is in. Will Shoheis horizontal aspirations be fulfilled? Will his irredeemably dull wife discover his guilty secret? Will he go to the ball? You can be reassured that these questions will be answered to your satisfaction by the end of this endearingly sweet movie.

    Shall We Dance? (Japan, 1996) opens to the tune of the same title, from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical and movie, The King and I. We are in a ballroom of the Blackpool Tower, England, home to a complex of buildings that host the most prestigious of international ballroom dancing competitions. A Japanese narrator draws a contrast to his own country: "In Japan, ballroom dance is regarded with much suspicion. In a country where married couples don't go out arm in arm, much less say, 'I love you' out loud, intuitive understanding is everything. The idea that a husband and wife should embrace and dance in front of others is beyond embarrassing. However, to go out dancing with someone else would be misunderstood and prove more shameful. Nonetheless, even for Japanese people, there is a secret wonder about the joys that dance can bring." Here and there, the wonder has been inspired by Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr from the Rodgers & Hammerstein film production. Other adventurous Japanese, by whatever means, have likewise been drawn to the ballroom dance floor. For Mr. Sugiyama, a middle-aged accountant with a wife and daughter, it begins at a commuter train stop where he spies a young woman looking out the upper-story window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing, and is captivated. This leads to lessons. Koji Yakusho is exceptional in the lead acting role. Tamiyo Kusakari plays the young woman from the window, who turns out to be a professional with aspirations to return to Blackpool. Reiko Kusamura is excellent as the very patient, somewhat older woman who ends up as the instructor of Mr. Sugiyama and his two nearly as clumsy male classmates. This is one of the all-time bests from among Japanese movies, particularly those of the non-samurai genre. Richard Gere starred in an Americanized version in 2004, but the Japanese original scores higher with IMDb ratings voters. If it suits your fancy, explore also the very funny Australian comedy-romance, Strictly Ballroom (1992).

    This is the original Shall We Dansu, a Japanese film that takes a look at the society around it and the shameful act of dancing. It is considered out of the society's norms to dance, whether it is in a studio or at home, especially ballroom dancing. This is exactly what the main character Shohei Sugiyama is looking for to break from his mundane life. While the topic of the film is better understood with the knowledge of Japanese culture it is still hilarious to watch while still maintaining its heart-felt plot. Shall We Dansu has a very serious plot of a man trying to break from his daily routine, but also adds in a slew of comedy through gags and dialog. Some scenes are laugh out loud while others just give a chuckle to break up tension. However, this is a very funny film with a very interesting story line. The one thing to be aware of is that this is the original Japanese version. There has been a more recent Hollywood version that falls very short in comparison. The Hollywood version was a flop and took an amazing movie and turned it into a pointless waste of time.

I am sometimes amazed how we can interpret characters in a film just by their physical appearance. For example Tamako Sensei is the forgiving type of person that she appears! Also Macho is the sleazy type of dancer that he appears! They wouldn't need to do or say anything and I would still conclude the same. Pros - Every single thing plus Aoki San Cons - The score is occasionally heavy handed Overall - 11 out of 10

    What makes "Casablanca" the great movie it is is that it doesn't try to tell the history of the world; it is not an epic; it is a perfectly polished little gem, "the problems of three little people" told exquisitely. "Shall We Dance" is such a polished gem. Set in the Japanese culture where all dancing is suspect, a middle-class middle-management man who has lost the luster of his life sees a beautiful young woman looking wistfully out the window of a dance studio and, eventually, goes looking for her. He finds much, much more. Does infidelity ensue? You'll have to decide for yourself. What does ensue is magic, not Harry Potter magic, the everyday ordinary kind of magic that makes the world of us common people so wonderfully worth living. I've said enough. There is so much sparkle to this gem throughout I feel as if nearly everything I want to tell you is a spoiler. See this movie. You owe it to yourself. You'll thank me.

    I saw the American cut of this Japanese movie, which has several scenes and characters removed. At that, "Shall We Dance" is a charming movie with tons of heart. Written and directed by Masayuki Suo, "Shall We Dance" has something "Strictly Ballroom" lacks: depth and feeling. I'll compare Baz Luhrman with Oscar Wilde: all flash and showy surface, with nothing underneath. Masayuki Suo has created a film with characters who move us. Koji Yakusho, Naoto Takenaka, Naoto Takenaka, and the other actors are excellent in their roles. The gist of the plot is that Mr. Sugiyama (Yakusho) is an overworked salaryman who spies a lovely younger woman in the window of a dance studio on his way home from work on the train. He has a wife, a daughter, and a mortgage, and no dreams. He takes up ballroom dancing to meet the younger woman, whose father owns the studio and who gives lessons. Dancing, of course, becomes a metaphor, and his fellow students grow from awkward, nameless bumblers to awkward, feeling humans as he (and we) learn to know them. The changes in the minor characters are more dramatic than the subtle growth of Mr. Sugiyama. In "Shall We Dance," learning dance means proceeding from our awkward, graceless first steps to feeling the music and trusting your partner. Feeling emotion and trusting your partner and yourself go hand in hand with learning the dance. The process gets a little heavy-handed as characters spell it out for us, but it didn't detract from the emotional investment we make in watching the characters grow. The movie is often funny without being a comedy, and it's not a romance with budding young love -- Mr. Sugiyama is in his forties, and his dream girl has no romantic interest in him. But they develop a relationship on another, still meaningful level. "Shall We Dance" is also the title of a 1937 Astaire-Rogers film, and the Japanese version was remade under the same title in 2004, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. I have not seen either of these two movies.

    Fabulous! Heart-warming! It's lovely film to watch. It's in slow drive with a slow build-up so don't expect any high-flouting gushy-type scenes. It's one of the few films that well demonstrates the gradualness and step- by-step approach involved of learning a new skill. The novice dancers don't become suddenly flamboyant  they awkwardly move along. The main actor is wonderful and under-stated. I suppose he represents all us guys who are just too shy and inhibited to start to dance. There are some nice sub-plots  eclectic dancers, detectives and a daughter who steps in at the proper times. All and all a life-affirming film!

    Shall We Dance is about a bored accountant Sugiyama,who on his evening commute,always looks at the beautiful woman who gazes wistfully out the window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing. One night he gets off the train, walks into the studio, and signs up for a class. Soon Sugiyama is so engrossed in his dancing he practices his steps on the train platform and under his desk, and becomes good enough for competition, compelling his wife to hire a private investigator to find out why he stays out late and returns home smelling of perfume. Among the colorful characters Sugiyama meets is his coworker Aoki,who transforms himself from geeky systems analyst to hilariously flamboyant (and bad-wigged) lounge lizard. Aoki explains to Sugiyama, "When I finish work, put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns, Latin world champion, and I start to move to the rhythm, I'm so happy, so completely free." Here lies the chief charm of Shall We Dance, the contrast between the ultra-competitive women of the studio--including the one who caught Sugiyama's eye, Mai --and the men who dance simply because they enjoy it. This is a great film tackles issues such as the views on men in the Japanese culture,mid-life crisis and ballroom dancing.The cast in the film were excellent.This is one of the best Japanese films I have ever seen.And it is not a horror film.It takes into consideration the pains of middle-age and the need to feel alive during that stage. Overall,it is the best non-horror Japanese film I have ever seen. Highly recommended to everyone who wants an entertaining movie.

    As I understand it, much of the humor in "Shall We Dance?" derives from the stereotype of the Japanese businessman. A businessman in the Land of the Rising Sun is supposed to be very serious and motivated, as Shohei Sugiyama (Kōji Yakusho) is. He's successful but unfulfilled. But taking dancing lessons just might change that. Much like Baz Luhrmann's "Strictly Ballroom", "Shall We Dance?" shows that dancing is a physical form of communication. Shohei feels cut off from his wife and daughter, but the dance lessons help him open up. The movie knows how to present everything just right so that it comes across naturally and without seeming like a clich&eacute;. There was an American remake, but I have no plans to ever see that one.

    A Japanese salaryman (Koji Yakusho) feeling jaded by work and bored with his family life, joins a ballroom dancing class. Shall We Dance? is a delightful comedy, dealing with a modest, humble man's search for exuberance, spontaneity and passion in a life he finds restrained and crushing. It has a sweetness that is remarkably unforced. The film performed strongly in American theaters earning roughly $9.7 million during its US release. At the Japanese Academy Awards it won 14 awards, every award it was eligible to win. A disastrous American remake, starring Richard Gere, was released in 2004.

    Dancing: The vertical expression of a horizontal desire legalised by music. This quote may have been in the mind of middle aged salaryman Shohei (Kaji Yakusho) who realises that his life is unfulfilled as he watches dance instructor Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari) every night from his commuter train. In a moment of impulsiveness, he signs up for dance lessons to be near the sphinx like Mai. This might have been a movie about the budding romance between the somewhat improbably beautiful leads. Instead director Masayuki Suo focuses more on the excitement and passion of the ballroom than the attraction between Shohei and Mai, and makes a better, less predictable movie for it. Both the lead and supporting roles are played to near perfection, though Naoto Takenaka as the troll like Latin wannabe Mr. Aoki, shamelessly steals every scene he is in. Will Shoheis horizontal aspirations be fulfilled? Will his irredeemably dull wife discover his guilty secret? Will he go to the ball? You can be reassured that these questions will be answered to your satisfaction by the end of this endearingly sweet movie.

    Shall We Dance? (Japan, 1996) opens to the tune of the same title, from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical and movie, The King and I. We are in a ballroom of the Blackpool Tower, England, home to a complex of buildings that host the most prestigious of international ballroom dancing competitions. A Japanese narrator draws a contrast to his own country: "In Japan, ballroom dance is regarded with much suspicion. In a country where married couples don't go out arm in arm, much less say, 'I love you' out loud, intuitive understanding is everything. The idea that a husband and wife should embrace and dance in front of others is beyond embarrassing. However, to go out dancing with someone else would be misunderstood and prove more shameful. Nonetheless, even for Japanese people, there is a secret wonder about the joys that dance can bring." Here and there, the wonder has been inspired by Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr from the Rodgers & Hammerstein film production. Other adventurous Japanese, by whatever means, have likewise been drawn to the ballroom dance floor. For Mr. Sugiyama, a middle-aged accountant with a wife and daughter, it begins at a commuter train stop where he spies a young woman looking out the upper-story window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing, and is captivated. This leads to lessons. Koji Yakusho is exceptional in the lead acting role. Tamiyo Kusakari plays the young woman from the window, who turns out to be a professional with aspirations to return to Blackpool. Reiko Kusamura is excellent as the very patient, somewhat older woman who ends up as the instructor of Mr. Sugiyama and his two nearly as clumsy male classmates. This is one of the all-time bests from among Japanese movies, particularly those of the non-samurai genre. Richard Gere starred in an Americanized version in 2004, but the Japanese original scores higher with IMDb ratings voters. If it suits your fancy, explore also the very funny Australian comedy-romance, Strictly Ballroom (1992).

    This is the original Shall We Dansu, a Japanese film that takes a look at the society around it and the shameful act of dancing. It is considered out of the society's norms to dance, whether it is in a studio or at home, especially ballroom dancing. This is exactly what the main character Shohei Sugiyama is looking for to break from his mundane life. While the topic of the film is better understood with the knowledge of Japanese culture it is still hilarious to watch while still maintaining its heart-felt plot. Shall We Dansu has a very serious plot of a man trying to break from his daily routine, but also adds in a slew of comedy through gags and dialog. Some scenes are laugh out loud while others just give a chuckle to break up tension. However, this is a very funny film with a very interesting story line. The one thing to be aware of is that this is the original Japanese version. There has been a more recent Hollywood version that falls very short in comparison. The Hollywood version was a flop and took an amazing movie and turned it into a pointless waste of time. Do not see the remake; instead look at this original film, which is able to captivate humor and drama all in the same moment. The most important thing to understand about this film is that in this Japanese society it is taboo to dance. If you try to place this film outside of that context, like how the remake attempted, it loses everything that makes this film worth seeing. While analyzing society, and the norms of that society, Shall We Dansu is a captivating experience that mixes humor with drama to allow for an entertaining film experience.

What does ensue is magic, not Harry Potter magic, the everyday ordinary kind of magic that makes the world of us common people so wonderfully worth living. I've said enough. There is so much sparkle to this gem throughout I feel as if nearly everything I want to tell you is a spoiler. See this movie. You owe it to yourself. You'll thank me.

    I saw the American cut of this Japanese movie, which has several scenes and characters removed. At that, "Shall We Dance" is a charming movie with tons of heart. Written and directed by Masayuki Suo, "Shall We Dance" has something "Strictly Ballroom" lacks: depth and feeling. I'll compare Baz Luhrman with Oscar Wilde: all flash and showy surface, with nothing underneath. Masayuki Suo has created a film with characters who move us. Koji Yakusho, Naoto Takenaka, Naoto Takenaka, and the other actors are excellent in their roles. The gist of the plot is that Mr. Sugiyama (Yakusho) is an overworked salaryman who spies a lovely younger woman in the window of a dance studio on his way home from work on the train. He has a wife, a daughter, and a mortgage, and no dreams. He takes up ballroom dancing to meet the younger woman, whose father owns the studio and who gives lessons. Dancing, of course, becomes a metaphor, and his fellow students grow from awkward, nameless bumblers to awkward, feeling humans as he (and we) learn to know them. The changes in the minor characters are more dramatic than the subtle growth of Mr. Sugiyama. In "Shall We Dance," learning dance means proceeding from our awkward, graceless first steps to feeling the music and trusting your partner. Feeling emotion and trusting your partner and yourself go hand in hand with learning the dance. The process gets a little heavy-handed as characters spell it out for us, but it didn't detract from the emotional investment we make in watching the characters grow. The movie is often funny without being a comedy, and it's not a romance with budding young love -- Mr. Sugiyama is in his forties, and his dream girl has no romantic interest in him. But they develop a relationship on another, still meaningful level. "Shall We Dance" is also the title of a 1937 Astaire-Rogers film, and the Japanese version was remade under the same title in 2004, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. I have not seen either of these two movies.

    Fabulous! Heart-warming! It's lovely film to watch. It's in slow drive with a slow build-up so don't expect any high-flouting gushy-type scenes. It's one of the few films that well demonstrates the gradualness and step- by-step approach involved of learning a new skill. The novice dancers don't become suddenly flamboyant  they awkwardly move along. The main actor is wonderful and under-stated. I suppose he represents all us guys who are just too shy and inhibited to start to dance. There are some nice sub-plots  eclectic dancers, detectives and a daughter who steps in at the proper times. All and all a life-affirming film!

    Shall We Dance is about a bored accountant Sugiyama,who on his evening commute,always looks at the beautiful woman who gazes wistfully out the window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing. One night he gets off the train, walks into the studio, and signs up for a class. Soon Sugiyama is so engrossed in his dancing he practices his steps on the train platform and under his desk, and becomes good enough for competition, compelling his wife to hire a private investigator to find out why he stays out late and returns home smelling of perfume. Among the colorful characters Sugiyama meets is his coworker Aoki,who transforms himself from geeky systems analyst to hilariously flamboyant (and bad-wigged) lounge lizard. Aoki explains to Sugiyama, "When I finish work, put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns, Latin world champion, and I start to move to the rhythm, I'm so happy, so completely free." Here lies the chief charm of Shall We Dance, the contrast between the ultra-competitive women of the studio--including the one who caught Sugiyama's eye, Mai --and the men who dance simply because they enjoy it. This is a great film tackles issues such as the views on men in the Japanese culture,mid-life crisis and ballroom dancing.The cast in the film were excellent.This is one of the best Japanese films I have ever seen.And it is not a horror film.It takes into consideration the pains of middle-age and the need to feel alive during that stage. Overall,it is the best non-horror Japanese film I have ever seen. Highly recommended to everyone who wants an entertaining movie.

    As I understand it, much of the humor in "Shall We Dance?" derives from the stereotype of the Japanese businessman. A businessman in the Land of the Rising Sun is supposed to be very serious and motivated, as Shohei Sugiyama (Kōji Yakusho) is. He's successful but unfulfilled. But taking dancing lessons just might change that. Much like Baz Luhrmann's "Strictly Ballroom", "Shall We Dance?" shows that dancing is a physical form of communication. Shohei feels cut off from his wife and daughter, but the dance lessons help him open up. The movie knows how to present everything just right so that it comes across naturally and without seeming like a clich&eacute;. There was an American remake, but I have no plans to ever see that one.

    A Japanese salaryman (Koji Yakusho) feeling jaded by work and bored with his family life, joins a ballroom dancing class. Shall We Dance? is a delightful comedy, dealing with a modest, humble man's search for exuberance, spontaneity and passion in a life he finds restrained and crushing. It has a sweetness that is remarkably unforced. The film performed strongly in American theaters earning roughly $9.7 million during its US release. At the Japanese Academy Awards it won 14 awards, every award it was eligible to win. A disastrous American remake, starring Richard Gere, was released in 2004.

    Dancing: The vertical expression of a horizontal desire legalised by music. This quote may have been in the mind of middle aged salaryman Shohei (Kaji Yakusho) who realises that his life is unfulfilled as he watches dance instructor Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari) every night from his commuter train. In a moment of impulsiveness, he signs up for dance lessons to be near the sphinx like Mai. This might have been a movie about the budding romance between the somewhat improbably beautiful leads. Instead director Masayuki Suo focuses more on the excitement and passion of the ballroom than the attraction between Shohei and Mai, and makes a better, less predictable movie for it. Both the lead and supporting roles are played to near perfection, though Naoto Takenaka as the troll like Latin wannabe Mr. Aoki, shamelessly steals every scene he is in. Will Shoheis horizontal aspirations be fulfilled? Will his irredeemably dull wife discover his guilty secret? Will he go to the ball? You can be reassured that these questions will be answered to your satisfaction by the end of this endearingly sweet movie.

    Shall We Dance? (Japan, 1996) opens to the tune of the same title, from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical and movie, The King and I. We are in a ballroom of the Blackpool Tower, England, home to a complex of buildings that host the most prestigious of international ballroom dancing competitions. A Japanese narrator draws a contrast to his own country: "In Japan, ballroom dance is regarded with much suspicion. In a country where married couples don't go out arm in arm, much less say, 'I love you' out loud, intuitive understanding is everything. The idea that a husband and wife should embrace and dance in front of others is beyond embarrassing. However, to go out dancing with someone else would be misunderstood and prove more shameful. Nonetheless, even for Japanese people, there is a secret wonder about the joys that dance can bring." Here and there, the wonder has been inspired by Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr from the Rodgers & Hammerstein film production. Other adventurous Japanese, by whatever means, have likewise been drawn to the ballroom dance floor. For Mr. Sugiyama, a middle-aged accountant with a wife and daughter, it begins at a commuter train stop where he spies a young woman looking out the upper-story window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing, and is captivated. This leads to lessons. Koji Yakusho is exceptional in the lead acting role. Tamiyo Kusakari plays the young woman from the window, who turns out to be a professional with aspirations to return to Blackpool. Reiko Kusamura is excellent as the very patient, somewhat older woman who ends up as the instructor of Mr. Sugiyama and his two nearly as clumsy male classmates. This is one of the all-time bests from among Japanese movies, particularly those of the non-samurai genre. Richard Gere starred in an Americanized version in 2004, but the Japanese original scores higher with IMDb ratings voters. If it suits your fancy, explore also the very funny Australian comedy-romance, Strictly Ballroom (1992).

    This is the original Shall We Dansu, a Japanese film that takes a look at the society around it and the shameful act of dancing. It is considered out of the society's norms to dance, whether it is in a studio or at home, especially ballroom dancing. This is exactly what the main character Shohei Sugiyama is looking for to break from his mundane life. While the topic of the film is better understood with the knowledge of Japanese culture it is still hilarious to watch while still maintaining its heart-felt plot. Shall We Dansu has a very serious plot of a man trying to break from his daily routine, but also adds in a slew of comedy through gags and dialog. Some scenes are laugh out loud while others just give a chuckle to break up tension. However, this is a very funny film with a very interesting story line. The one thing to be aware of is that this is the original Japanese version. There has been a more recent Hollywood version that falls very short in comparison. The Hollywood version was a flop and took an amazing movie and turned it into a pointless waste of time. Do not see the remake; instead look at this original film, which is able to captivate humor and drama all in the same moment. The most important thing to understand about this film is that in this Japanese society it is taboo to dance. If you try to place this film outside of that context, like how the remake attempted, it loses everything that makes this film worth seeing. While analyzing society, and the norms of that society, Shall We Dansu is a captivating experience that mixes humor with drama to allow for an entertaining film experience.

    Masayuki Suo has produced a melodramatic story set in Japan that features ballroom dancing. Neither would particularly appeal however the film is elevated by a combination of depth, comedy featuring Aoki San and scenes shot in Blackpool! The most impressive aspect of this movie is how all of the characters come to life. Nearly 15 years after its release, its only now that I have had the pleasure of seeing it. The story focuses on a man undergoing a mid-life crisis who spontaneously takes up ballroom dancing. The film proceeds to follow the characters who make up the dance class. I am sometimes amazed how we can interpret characters in a film just by their physical appearance. For example Tamako Sensei is the forgiving type of person that she appears! Also Macho is the sleazy type of dancer that he appears! They wouldn't need to do or say anything and I would still conclude the same. Pros - Every single thing plus Aoki San Cons - The score is occasionally heavy handed Overall - 11 out of 10

    What makes "Casablanca" the great movie it is is that it doesn't try to tell the history of the world; it is not an epic; it is a perfectly polished little gem, "the problems of three little people" told exquisitely. "Shall We Dance" is such a polished gem. Set in the Japanese culture where all dancing is suspect, a middle-class middle-management man who has lost the luster of his life sees a beautiful young woman looking wistfully out the window of a dance studio and, eventually, goes looking for her.

The gist of the plot is that Mr. Sugiyama (Yakusho) is an overworked salaryman who spies a lovely younger woman in the window of a dance studio on his way home from work on the train. He has a wife, a daughter, and a mortgage, and no dreams. He takes up ballroom dancing to meet the younger woman, whose father owns the studio and who gives lessons. Dancing, of course, becomes a metaphor, and his fellow students grow from awkward, nameless bumblers to awkward, feeling humans as he (and we) learn to know them. The changes in the minor characters are more dramatic than the subtle growth of Mr. Sugiyama. In "Shall We Dance," learning dance means proceeding from our awkward, graceless first steps to feeling the music and trusting your partner. Feeling emotion and trusting your partner and yourself go hand in hand with learning the dance. The process gets a little heavy-handed as characters spell it out for us, but it didn't detract from the emotional investment we make in watching the characters grow. The movie is often funny without being a comedy, and it's not a romance with budding young love -- Mr. Sugiyama is in his forties, and his dream girl has no romantic interest in him. But they develop a relationship on another, still meaningful level. "Shall We Dance" is also the title of a 1937 Astaire-Rogers film, and the Japanese version was remade under the same title in 2004, starring Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. I have not seen either of these two movies.

    Fabulous! Heart-warming! It's lovely film to watch. It's in slow drive with a slow build-up so don't expect any high-flouting gushy-type scenes. It's one of the few films that well demonstrates the gradualness and step- by-step approach involved of learning a new skill. The novice dancers don't become suddenly flamboyant  they awkwardly move along. The main actor is wonderful and under-stated. I suppose he represents all us guys who are just too shy and inhibited to start to dance. There are some nice sub-plots  eclectic dancers, detectives and a daughter who steps in at the proper times. All and all a life-affirming film!

    Shall We Dance is about a bored accountant Sugiyama,who on his evening commute,always looks at the beautiful woman who gazes wistfully out the window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing. One night he gets off the train, walks into the studio, and signs up for a class. Soon Sugiyama is so engrossed in his dancing he practices his steps on the train platform and under his desk, and becomes good enough for competition, compelling his wife to hire a private investigator to find out why he stays out late and returns home smelling of perfume. Among the colorful characters Sugiyama meets is his coworker Aoki,who transforms himself from geeky systems analyst to hilariously flamboyant (and bad-wigged) lounge lizard. Aoki explains to Sugiyama, "When I finish work, put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns, Latin world champion, and I start to move to the rhythm, I'm so happy, so completely free." Here lies the chief charm of Shall We Dance, the contrast between the ultra-competitive women of the studio--including the one who caught Sugiyama's eye, Mai --and the men who dance simply because they enjoy it. This is a great film tackles issues such as the views on men in the Japanese culture,mid-life crisis and ballroom dancing.The cast in the film were excellent.This is one of the best Japanese films I have ever seen.And it is not a horror film.It takes into consideration the pains of middle-age and the need to feel alive during that stage. Overall,it is the best non-horror Japanese film I have ever seen. Highly recommended to everyone who wants an entertaining movie.

    As I understand it, much of the humor in "Shall We Dance?" derives from the stereotype of the Japanese businessman. A businessman in the Land of the Rising Sun is supposed to be very serious and motivated, as Shohei Sugiyama (Kōji Yakusho) is. He's successful but unfulfilled. But taking dancing lessons just might change that. Much like Baz Luhrmann's "Strictly Ballroom", "Shall We Dance?" shows that dancing is a physical form of communication. Shohei feels cut off from his wife and daughter, but the dance lessons help him open up. The movie knows how to present everything just right so that it comes across naturally and without seeming like a clich&eacute;. There was an American remake, but I have no plans to ever see that one.

    A Japanese salaryman (Koji Yakusho) feeling jaded by work and bored with his family life, joins a ballroom dancing class. Shall We Dance? is a delightful comedy, dealing with a modest, humble man's search for exuberance, spontaneity and passion in a life he finds restrained and crushing. It has a sweetness that is remarkably unforced. The film performed strongly in American theaters earning roughly $9.7 million during its US release. At the Japanese Academy Awards it won 14 awards, every award it was eligible to win. A disastrous American remake, starring Richard Gere, was released in 2004.

    Dancing: The vertical expression of a horizontal desire legalised by music. This quote may have been in the mind of middle aged salaryman Shohei (Kaji Yakusho) who realises that his life is unfulfilled as he watches dance instructor Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari) every night from his commuter train. In a moment of impulsiveness, he signs up for dance lessons to be near the sphinx like Mai. This might have been a movie about the budding romance between the somewhat improbably beautiful leads. Instead director Masayuki Suo focuses more on the excitement and passion of the ballroom than the attraction between Shohei and Mai, and makes a better, less predictable movie for it. Both the lead and supporting roles are played to near perfection, though Naoto Takenaka as the troll like Latin wannabe Mr. Aoki, shamelessly steals every scene he is in. Will Shoheis horizontal aspirations be fulfilled? Will his irredeemably dull wife discover his guilty secret? Will he go to the ball? You can be reassured that these questions will be answered to your satisfaction by the end of this endearingly sweet movie.

    Shall We Dance? (Japan, 1996) opens to the tune of the same title, from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical and movie, The King and I. We are in a ballroom of the Blackpool Tower, England, home to a complex of buildings that host the most prestigious of international ballroom dancing competitions. A Japanese narrator draws a contrast to his own country: "In Japan, ballroom dance is regarded with much suspicion. In a country where married couples don't go out arm in arm, much less say, 'I love you' out loud, intuitive understanding is everything. The idea that a husband and wife should embrace and dance in front of others is beyond embarrassing. However, to go out dancing with someone else would be misunderstood and prove more shameful. Nonetheless, even for Japanese people, there is a secret wonder about the joys that dance can bring." Here and there, the wonder has been inspired by Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr from the Rodgers & Hammerstein film production. Other adventurous Japanese, by whatever means, have likewise been drawn to the ballroom dance floor. For Mr. Sugiyama, a middle-aged accountant with a wife and daughter, it begins at a commuter train stop where he spies a young woman looking out the upper-story window of the Kishikawa School of Dancing, and is captivated. This leads to lessons. Koji Yakusho is exceptional in the lead acting role. Tamiyo Kusakari plays the young woman from the window, who turns out to be a professional with aspirations to return to Blackpool. Reiko Kusamura is excellent as the very patient, somewhat older woman who ends up as the instructor of Mr. Sugiyama and his two nearly as clumsy male classmates. This is one of the all-time bests from among Japanese movies, particularly those of the non-samurai genre. Richard Gere starred in an Americanized version in 2004, but the Japanese original scores higher with IMDb ratings voters. If it suits your fancy, explore also the very funny Australian comedy-romance, Strictly Ballroom (1992).

    This is the original Shall We Dansu, a Japanese film that takes a look at the society around it and the shameful act of dancing. It is considered out of the society's norms to dance, whether it is in a studio or at home, especially ballroom dancing. This is exactly what the main character Shohei Sugiyama is looking for to break from his mundane life. While the topic of the film is better understood with the knowledge of Japanese culture it is still hilarious to watch while still maintaining its heart-felt plot. Shall We Dansu has a very serious plot of a man trying to break from his daily routine, but also adds in a slew of comedy through gags and dialog. Some scenes are laugh out loud while others just give a chuckle to break up tension. However, this is a very funny film with a very interesting story line. The one thing to be aware of is that this is the original Japanese version. There has been a more recent Hollywood version that falls very short in comparison. The Hollywood version was a flop and took an amazing movie and turned it into a pointless waste of time. Do not see the remake; instead look at this original film, which is able to captivate humor and drama all in the same moment. The most important thing to understand about this film is that in this Japanese society it is taboo to dance. If you try to place this film outside of that context, like how the remake attempted, it loses everything that makes this film worth seeing. While analyzing society, and the norms of that society, Shall We Dansu is a captivating experience that mixes humor with drama to allow for an entertaining film experience.

    Masayuki Suo has produced a melodramatic story set in Japan that features ballroom dancing. Neither would particularly appeal however the film is elevated by a combination of depth, comedy featuring Aoki San and scenes shot in Blackpool! The most impressive aspect of this movie is how all of the characters come to life. Nearly 15 years after its release, its only now that I have had the pleasure of seeing it. The story focuses on a man undergoing a mid-life crisis who spontaneously takes up ballroom dancing. The film proceeds to follow the characters who make up the dance class. I am sometimes amazed how we can interpret characters in a film just by their physical appearance. For example Tamako Sensei is the forgiving type of person that she appears! Also Macho is the sleazy type of dancer that he appears! They wouldn't need to do or say anything and I would still conclude the same. Pros - Every single thing plus Aoki San Cons - The score is occasionally heavy handed Overall - 11 out of 10

    What makes "Casablanca" the great movie it is is that it doesn't try to tell the history of the world; it is not an epic; it is a perfectly polished little gem, "the problems of three little people" told exquisitely. "Shall We Dance" is such a polished gem. Set in the Japanese culture where all dancing is suspect, a middle-class middle-management man who has lost the luster of his life sees a beautiful young woman looking wistfully out the window of a dance studio and, eventually, goes looking for her. He finds much, much more. Does infidelity ensue? You'll have to decide for yourself. What does ensue is magic, not Harry Potter magic, the everyday ordinary kind of magic that makes the world of us common people so wonderfully worth living. I've said enough. There is so much sparkle to this gem throughout I feel as if nearly everything I want to tell you is a spoiler. See this movie. You owe it to yourself. You'll thank me.

    I saw the American cut of this Japanese movie, which has several scenes and characters removed. At that, "Shall We Dance" is a charming movie with tons of heart. Written and directed by Masayuki Suo, "Shall We Dance" has something "Strictly Ballroom" lacks: depth and feeling. I'll compare Baz Luhrman with Oscar Wilde: all flash and showy surface, with nothing underneath. Masayuki Suo has created a film with characters who move us. Koji Yakusho, Naoto Takenaka, Naoto Takenaka, and the other actors are excellent in their roles.
