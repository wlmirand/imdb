  An Iowa corn farmer, hearing voices, interprets them as a command to build a baseball diamond in his fields; he does, and the Chicago Black Sox come.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella hears a voice in his corn field tell him, "If you build it, he will come." He interprets this message as an instruction to build a baseball field on his farm, upon which appear the ghosts of Shoeless Joe Jackson and the other seven Chicago White Sox players banned from the game for throwing the 1919 World Series. When the voices continue, Ray seeks out a reclusive author to help him understand the meaning of the messages and the purpose for his field.

    Put Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and baseball in a movie and you know I will watch it. There are not many things I love more in this world than baseball and movies. Field of Dreams is hands down the best baseball movie ever made. With the great acting from Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones is backed up by the great writing and interesting and mystical story. I first saw this movie when I was very young and The Voice scared me but I manned up and watched it, and I loved it. In case you don't know the story, Ray, a farmer from Iowa, hears a voice that changes his life. This embarks him on an adventure where dreams can come true and the sport of baseball ties in perfectly. Kevin Costner narrates the first scene and he gives am awesome backstory to Shoeless Joe Jackson, himself, his father, and his family. I love that scene for introducing everything we need to know about the movie. I never heard of Joe Jackson or the 1919 Black Sox Scandal so that was cool. The movie starts with the voice saying "If you build it, he will come," lines that everybody who has seen or even not seen the movie knows. These lines made this more than a baseball movie introducing mysticism and a higher power into the real world. The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, "to me it wasn't a game, it was life." Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth. Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, "Hey, is this Heaven?" "No, it's Iowa." The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless. Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The "People Will Come, Ray" speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

    I don't think that you necessarily have to be a baseball fan to love this movie, but it sure doesn't hurt,, being a life long baseball fan it was very easy for me to relate to the movie. a man hears voices in the middle of his Iowa cornfield, telling him if you will build it they will come,, as he struggles with what he thinks he hears,, he has pressure coming down on him from the bank,, as he is behind on his mortgage payments on the house and farm.. nobody believes the voices he hears except for his little daughter at first. so he is told to build a baseball field.. and all of a sudden out of the shadows of the corn stalks come some of the greatest players every to play the game,,, they claim they just wanna keep playing somewhere,, Shoeless Joe Jackson is one of the heroes to come out of the cornstalk,, James Earl JOnes,, plays Terrence Mann a 60 's revolutionary who has gone into hiding the past 30 or so years,, our farmer goes to visit him, as he holds some clues as to what will happen next,, great family movie,, love this movie,,

    That doesn't work on multiple levels. Actors playing themselves,playing two dimensional cartoon characters, listless direction and a corny and boring premise. I just ejected the movie halfway through. This movie was embarrassing to watch, such was the lameness of the acting and direction in this movie. What's his name? James Earl Jones, pompously sleepwalking through a throw away characterization of zero importance to anybody. The woman who plays Costner's wife should win an Emmy for most annoying actress to ever grace the silver screen. Liotta was good in one movie ever, otherwise, more sleepwalking. Costner...what ever happened to him? Look, I'll be honest, okay? I hate this movie!

    - A This is not just a film for baseball fans as it is a film about dreams and having the, come true. With an odd beginning of a man being told to build a random baseball field, he obeys and the fun begins with mysterious people playing ball and then the voices telling him to do other jobs which leads to one big connection between people from all around the U.S. James Earl Jones is a very memorable character as well as Ray Liotta and Costner as the man who builds it. The ending is one that makes you glad as he gets one wish come true. An excellent dreamy film.

    ***SPOILERS** Whimsical and heart warming story that uses the game of Baseball and the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox, forever known as the Chicago Black Sox, team as some kind of metaphor in bringing together transplanted from Brooklyn NY Iwoa farmer Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner, with his long dead father John, Dwier Brown, who passed away when Ray was 14. It was when walking through his corn field that Ray keeps hearing this voice telling him "That if you build it he will come". Thinking that he's suffering from a mild case of heat stroke Ray doesn't take it seriously until it, or the voice, shows him like a mirage in the desert a baseball diamond situated right in the middle of his cornfield! It's after when Ray bulldozed most of his cornfield under to build a baseball diamond and outfield following the instructions of the mysterious voice that his daughter Karin, Gabby Hoffman, notices a stranger wearing a baseball uniform hanging out on the field looking like he's lost! With Ray and his wife Annie, Amy Madigan, going to check things out it's discovered that the stranger, wearing a 1919 Chicago White Sox uniform,in non other the the great Shoeless Joe Jackson played by Ray Liotta. The most shocking thing about all this despite Shoeless Joe batting right-handed, he was in real life a left handed batter, the guy's been dead and buried for almost 40 years! Flabbergasted at what he as well as his wife Amy and daughter Karin are seeing Ray watches in stunned disbelief all the members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox emerge ,like ghosts in the night, out of his remaining corn field to play perpetual baseball without even bothering to eat or sleep! Completely under the spell of the mysterious voice Ray is told to travel to far off Boston and get in touch with 1960's activist and now in hiding and not talking or seeing anyone revolutionary and free love writer Terrence, his friends if he still has any call him Terry, Mann played by James Earl Jones. It's Ray's job according to the voice to not only take the at first very reluctant Mann to the Red Sox A's game at Fenway Park but also have the cash strapped Ray, who just about went broke building his baseball field, to treat him to a beer & hot dog! What the hell was all this about anyway? What's the reason for the voice to instruct Ray to do these mindless crazy and stupid things? We soon find out what's really going on in the movie when on the giant TV scoreboard over Fenway Park's right center field bleachers flashes the name Archibald "Moonlight" Graham and the place where he's supposed to be living Chisholm Minnisota that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only Ray & Mann could see! It's when both Ray and the now,in both seeing the light and hearing the voice, very agreeable Terry Mann, who at first thought that Ray was out of his mind, travel to Chisolm where they find out that Archie Garahm, Burt Lancaster, has been dead for the last 16 years! But that very pressing problem is solved with the two, Ray & Terry Mann, soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before Graham, who was the town doctor, kicked off and thus be able to talk to him! We later find out what Doc. Graham's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold: One for himself and the other and far more important reason for the Kinsella family! ***SPOILERS*** You've got to suspend belief watching "Field of Dreams" like everyone in it including Ray's brother in law Mark, Timothy Busfield, who at first thought that he and his sister Amy were nuts but later saw, when the 1919 White Sox revealed themselves to him, the light of "reality" and went along with the program! Touching and emotionally packed final when Ray gets to meet his dad John who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him! And while that's happening not only did he, Ray's dad John, come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire USA to fill the cornfield's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop. All that in order for them to watch both father and son together with the 1919 Chicago White Sox lead by Shoeless "Say it ain't So" Joe Jackson playing the great All American game of Baseball!

    I remember seeing this gem for the first time in the theatre and how it affected me emotionally. Had to be one of the best movies from the summer of 1989, this is an fantastic film from an even more fantastic book. The central theme of this movie is about regret and having the opportunity to get second chances. Even though the audience doesn't learn till the end of the movie what Kevin Costner's character's regret and redemption is, we experience some amazing and interesting co-starring wonderful characters (with Ray Liotta "Shoeless Joe" and Burt Lancaster's as the country doctor). The actors James Jones and Amy Madigan keep the storyline so well grounded, and only at the end of the movie does the magic we have been waiting for really take off. Kevin Costner is just brilliant to watch in this movie. This movie has to be one of his better performances that he has ever given. There was the potential to get all sappy and go over the top with his role, but much to my satisfaction he keeps everything even keel. Phil Robinson, the director, has created a wonderful movie with engrossing soundtrack combined with the most amazing and cinematic cinematography. Highly recommended for being a wonderful family movie.

    When i saw this movie for the first time in 1989 , i had previously been fairly distant , or i think the better word was indifferent, to both my parents up to that point after having moved out of the house in 1974. This movie was a wake up call and i started visiting my parents more and more thru the years and was glad that this movie came along to push me to get closer to my parents because in January 2012 , my mom passed away and 1 month later my father passed away. Think about the relationship you have with your parents when you watch this. Could it use a little improvement ? Think about how hard your parents worked to make you who you are today. Show them some appreciation , you'll be glad you did. It was this movie that made me get as much good quality time as i did prior to their passing. This movie isn't a baseball movie , its a movie about getting a second chance at repairing and enhancing your relationship with your father and actually , with both your parents. Without this movie , i would find myself sitting in a big vat of guilt and regrets. the main theme to this film...... redemption.

    Let me start off by telling everyone that,my knowledge in baseball is almost in negative terms. I loved this movie!.. I have been wanting to see this movie for quite a while now,so when the opportunity presented itself,i didn't hesitate to take it.This probably is one of the best executed father-son movie of all time. The movie starts off without much off a prologue. We find ourselves,suddenly in the midst of an out of the world experience. But the strangest part is, that it all makes sense (in some weird way)..The acting is of course,extraordinary. But more than that,the direction is to be the most complimented part of this movie. I found myself crying,after the end of the movie..It truly is a feel good movie

    This is one of my favorite movies to watch. A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. A great gem for anyone. This is not just a baseball movie. It really hit home that it was just a awareness that we are all flawed, the expectations we have for our parents sometimes too high, especially when we grow up sometimes we aren't able to achieve. This is also about having a second chance to say hello to Dad. To enjoy doing something he enjoyed and and what his father before him enjoyed, but you were too young to maybe appreciate what that moment meant at the time. I had started to realize how much baseball is a American past time near the end of the movie after James Earl Jones speaks about it. I could watch it again and again not just for the sport but for the sheer fun of living through that moment that might not happen anymore unless you have your own kids.

    "Field of Dreams" embraces its own poetry with such daringness that only one epithet comes to my mind: perfect. The film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball, to what the game stands for in American culture. Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple: baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him "If you build it, he will come". This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of "Field of Dreams": it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919. And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is. And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. "Are you a ghost?" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. "Is this heaven?" he asks in return before leaving for the night, "No, It's Iowa." replies an overwhelmed Costner. The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': "Ease his pain", "Go the distance". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game. Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in "Field of Dreams" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen. And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, "Field of Dreams" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film. There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as "Field of Dreams" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.

Costner...what ever happened to him? Look, I'll be honest, okay? I hate this movie!

    ***SPOILERS** Whimsical and heart warming story that uses the game of Baseball and the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox, forever known as the Chicago Black Sox, team as some kind of metaphor in bringing together transplanted from Brooklyn NY Iwoa farmer Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner, with his long dead father John, Dwier Brown, who passed away when Ray was 14. It was when walking through his corn field that Ray keeps hearing this voice telling him "That if you build it he will come". Thinking that he's suffering from a mild case of heat stroke Ray doesn't take it seriously until it, or the voice, shows him like a mirage in the desert a baseball diamond situated right in the middle of his cornfield! It's after when Ray bulldozed most of his cornfield under to build a baseball diamond and outfield following the instructions of the mysterious voice that his daughter Karin, Gabby Hoffman, notices a stranger wearing a baseball uniform hanging out on the field looking like he's lost! With Ray and his wife Annie, Amy Madigan, going to check things out it's discovered that the stranger, wearing a 1919 Chicago White Sox uniform,in non other the the great Shoeless Joe Jackson played by Ray Liotta. The most shocking thing about all this despite Shoeless Joe batting right-handed, he was in real life a left handed batter, the guy's been dead and buried for almost 40 years! Flabbergasted at what he as well as his wife Amy and daughter Karin are seeing Ray watches in stunned disbelief all the members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox emerge ,like ghosts in the night, out of his remaining corn field to play perpetual baseball without even bothering to eat or sleep! Completely under the spell of the mysterious voice Ray is told to travel to far off Boston and get in touch with 1960's activist and now in hiding and not talking or seeing anyone revolutionary and free love writer Terrence, his friends if he still has any call him Terry, Mann played by James Earl Jones. It's Ray's job according to the voice to not only take the at first very reluctant Mann to the Red Sox A's game at Fenway Park but also have the cash strapped Ray, who just about went broke building his baseball field, to treat him to a beer & hot dog! What the hell was all this about anyway? What's the reason for the voice to instruct Ray to do these mindless crazy and stupid things? We soon find out what's really going on in the movie when on the giant TV scoreboard over Fenway Park's right center field bleachers flashes the name Archibald "Moonlight" Graham and the place where he's supposed to be living Chisholm Minnisota that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only Ray & Mann could see! It's when both Ray and the now,in both seeing the light and hearing the voice, very agreeable Terry Mann, who at first thought that Ray was out of his mind, travel to Chisolm where they find out that Archie Garahm, Burt Lancaster, has been dead for the last 16 years! But that very pressing problem is solved with the two, Ray & Terry Mann, soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before Graham, who was the town doctor, kicked off and thus be able to talk to him! We later find out what Doc. Graham's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold: One for himself and the other and far more important reason for the Kinsella family! ***SPOILERS*** You've got to suspend belief watching "Field of Dreams" like everyone in it including Ray's brother in law Mark, Timothy Busfield, who at first thought that he and his sister Amy were nuts but later saw, when the 1919 White Sox revealed themselves to him, the light of "reality" and went along with the program! Touching and emotionally packed final when Ray gets to meet his dad John who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him! And while that's happening not only did he, Ray's dad John, come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire USA to fill the cornfield's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop. All that in order for them to watch both father and son together with the 1919 Chicago White Sox lead by Shoeless "Say it ain't So" Joe Jackson playing the great All American game of Baseball!

    I remember seeing this gem for the first time in the theatre and how it affected me emotionally. Had to be one of the best movies from the summer of 1989, this is an fantastic film from an even more fantastic book. The central theme of this movie is about regret and having the opportunity to get second chances. Even though the audience doesn't learn till the end of the movie what Kevin Costner's character's regret and redemption is, we experience some amazing and interesting co-starring wonderful characters (with Ray Liotta "Shoeless Joe" and Burt Lancaster's as the country doctor). The actors James Jones and Amy Madigan keep the storyline so well grounded, and only at the end of the movie does the magic we have been waiting for really take off. Kevin Costner is just brilliant to watch in this movie. This movie has to be one of his better performances that he has ever given. There was the potential to get all sappy and go over the top with his role, but much to my satisfaction he keeps everything even keel. Phil Robinson, the director, has created a wonderful movie with engrossing soundtrack combined with the most amazing and cinematic cinematography. Highly recommended for being a wonderful family movie.

    When i saw this movie for the first time in 1989 , i had previously been fairly distant , or i think the better word was indifferent, to both my parents up to that point after having moved out of the house in 1974. This movie was a wake up call and i started visiting my parents more and more thru the years and was glad that this movie came along to push me to get closer to my parents because in January 2012 , my mom passed away and 1 month later my father passed away. Think about the relationship you have with your parents when you watch this. Could it use a little improvement ? Think about how hard your parents worked to make you who you are today. Show them some appreciation , you'll be glad you did. It was this movie that made me get as much good quality time as i did prior to their passing. This movie isn't a baseball movie , its a movie about getting a second chance at repairing and enhancing your relationship with your father and actually , with both your parents. Without this movie , i would find myself sitting in a big vat of guilt and regrets. the main theme to this film...... redemption.

    Let me start off by telling everyone that,my knowledge in baseball is almost in negative terms. I loved this movie!.. I have been wanting to see this movie for quite a while now,so when the opportunity presented itself,i didn't hesitate to take it.This probably is one of the best executed father-son movie of all time. The movie starts off without much off a prologue. We find ourselves,suddenly in the midst of an out of the world experience. But the strangest part is, that it all makes sense (in some weird way)..The acting is of course,extraordinary. But more than that,the direction is to be the most complimented part of this movie. I found myself crying,after the end of the movie..It truly is a feel good movie

    This is one of my favorite movies to watch. A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. A great gem for anyone. This is not just a baseball movie. It really hit home that it was just a awareness that we are all flawed, the expectations we have for our parents sometimes too high, especially when we grow up sometimes we aren't able to achieve. This is also about having a second chance to say hello to Dad. To enjoy doing something he enjoyed and and what his father before him enjoyed, but you were too young to maybe appreciate what that moment meant at the time. I had started to realize how much baseball is a American past time near the end of the movie after James Earl Jones speaks about it. I could watch it again and again not just for the sport but for the sheer fun of living through that moment that might not happen anymore unless you have your own kids.

    "Field of Dreams" embraces its own poetry with such daringness that only one epithet comes to my mind: perfect. The film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball, to what the game stands for in American culture. Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple: baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him "If you build it, he will come". This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of "Field of Dreams": it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919. And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is. And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. "Are you a ghost?" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. "Is this heaven?" he asks in return before leaving for the night, "No, It's Iowa." replies an overwhelmed Costner. The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': "Ease his pain", "Go the distance". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game. Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in "Field of Dreams" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen. And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, "Field of Dreams" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film. There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as "Field of Dreams" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.

    Put Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and baseball in a movie and you know I will watch it. There are not many things I love more in this world than baseball and movies. Field of Dreams is hands down the best baseball movie ever made. With the great acting from Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones is backed up by the great writing and interesting and mystical story. I first saw this movie when I was very young and The Voice scared me but I manned up and watched it, and I loved it. In case you don't know the story, Ray, a farmer from Iowa, hears a voice that changes his life. This embarks him on an adventure where dreams can come true and the sport of baseball ties in perfectly. Kevin Costner narrates the first scene and he gives am awesome backstory to Shoeless Joe Jackson, himself, his father, and his family. I love that scene for introducing everything we need to know about the movie. I never heard of Joe Jackson or the 1919 Black Sox Scandal so that was cool. The movie starts with the voice saying "If you build it, he will come," lines that everybody who has seen or even not seen the movie knows. These lines made this more than a baseball movie introducing mysticism and a higher power into the real world. The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, "to me it wasn't a game, it was life." Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth. Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, "Hey, is this Heaven?" "No, it's Iowa." The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless. Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The "People Will Come, Ray" speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

    I don't think that you necessarily have to be a baseball fan to love this movie, but it sure doesn't hurt,, being a life long baseball fan it was very easy for me to relate to the movie. a man hears voices in the middle of his Iowa cornfield, telling him if you will build it they will come,, as he struggles with what he thinks he hears,, he has pressure coming down on him from the bank,, as he is behind on his mortgage payments on the house and farm.. nobody believes the voices he hears except for his little daughter at first. so he is told to build a baseball field.. and all of a sudden out of the shadows of the corn stalks come some of the greatest players every to play the game,,, they claim they just wanna keep playing somewhere,, Shoeless Joe Jackson is one of the heroes to come out of the cornstalk,, James Earl JOnes,, plays Terrence Mann a 60 's revolutionary who has gone into hiding the past 30 or so years,, our farmer goes to visit him, as he holds some clues as to what will happen next,, great family movie,, love this movie,,

    That doesn't work on multiple levels. Actors playing themselves,playing two dimensional cartoon characters, listless direction and a corny and boring premise. I just ejected the movie halfway through. This movie was embarrassing to watch, such was the lameness of the acting and direction in this movie. What's his name? James Earl Jones, pompously sleepwalking through a throw away characterization of zero importance to anybody. The woman who plays Costner's wife should win an Emmy for most annoying actress to ever grace the silver screen. Liotta was good in one movie ever, otherwise, more sleepwalking. Costner...what ever happened to him? Look, I'll be honest, okay? I hate this movie!

I have been wanting to see this movie for quite a while now,so when the opportunity presented itself,i didn't hesitate to take it.This probably is one of the best executed father-son movie of all time. The movie starts off without much off a prologue. We find ourselves,suddenly in the midst of an out of the world experience. But the strangest part is, that it all makes sense (in some weird way)..The acting is of course,extraordinary. But more than that,the direction is to be the most complimented part of this movie. I found myself crying,after the end of the movie..It truly is a feel good movie

    This is one of my favorite movies to watch. A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. A great gem for anyone. This is not just a baseball movie. It really hit home that it was just a awareness that we are all flawed, the expectations we have for our parents sometimes too high, especially when we grow up sometimes we aren't able to achieve. This is also about having a second chance to say hello to Dad. To enjoy doing something he enjoyed and and what his father before him enjoyed, but you were too young to maybe appreciate what that moment meant at the time. I had started to realize how much baseball is a American past time near the end of the movie after James Earl Jones speaks about it. I could watch it again and again not just for the sport but for the sheer fun of living through that moment that might not happen anymore unless you have your own kids.

    "Field of Dreams" embraces its own poetry with such daringness that only one epithet comes to my mind: perfect. The film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball, to what the game stands for in American culture. Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple: baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him "If you build it, he will come". This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of "Field of Dreams": it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919. And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is. And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. "Are you a ghost?" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. "Is this heaven?" he asks in return before leaving for the night, "No, It's Iowa." replies an overwhelmed Costner. The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': "Ease his pain", "Go the distance". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game. Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in "Field of Dreams" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen. And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, "Field of Dreams" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film. There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as "Field of Dreams" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.

    Put Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and baseball in a movie and you know I will watch it. There are not many things I love more in this world than baseball and movies. Field of Dreams is hands down the best baseball movie ever made. With the great acting from Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones is backed up by the great writing and interesting and mystical story. I first saw this movie when I was very young and The Voice scared me but I manned up and watched it, and I loved it. In case you don't know the story, Ray, a farmer from Iowa, hears a voice that changes his life. This embarks him on an adventure where dreams can come true and the sport of baseball ties in perfectly. Kevin Costner narrates the first scene and he gives am awesome backstory to Shoeless Joe Jackson, himself, his father, and his family. I love that scene for introducing everything we need to know about the movie. I never heard of Joe Jackson or the 1919 Black Sox Scandal so that was cool. The movie starts with the voice saying "If you build it, he will come," lines that everybody who has seen or even not seen the movie knows. These lines made this more than a baseball movie introducing mysticism and a higher power into the real world. The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, "to me it wasn't a game, it was life." Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth. Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, "Hey, is this Heaven?" "No, it's Iowa." The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless. Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The "People Will Come, Ray" speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

    I don't think that you necessarily have to be a baseball fan to love this movie, but it sure doesn't hurt,, being a life long baseball fan it was very easy for me to relate to the movie. a man hears voices in the middle of his Iowa cornfield, telling him if you will build it they will come,, as he struggles with what he thinks he hears,, he has pressure coming down on him from the bank,, as he is behind on his mortgage payments on the house and farm.. nobody believes the voices he hears except for his little daughter at first. so he is told to build a baseball field.. and all of a sudden out of the shadows of the corn stalks come some of the greatest players every to play the game,,, they claim they just wanna keep playing somewhere,, Shoeless Joe Jackson is one of the heroes to come out of the cornstalk,, James Earl JOnes,, plays Terrence Mann a 60 's revolutionary who has gone into hiding the past 30 or so years,, our farmer goes to visit him, as he holds some clues as to what will happen next,, great family movie,, love this movie,,

    That doesn't work on multiple levels. Actors playing themselves,playing two dimensional cartoon characters, listless direction and a corny and boring premise. I just ejected the movie halfway through. This movie was embarrassing to watch, such was the lameness of the acting and direction in this movie. What's his name? James Earl Jones, pompously sleepwalking through a throw away characterization of zero importance to anybody. The woman who plays Costner's wife should win an Emmy for most annoying actress to ever grace the silver screen. Liotta was good in one movie ever, otherwise, more sleepwalking. Costner...what ever happened to him? Look, I'll be honest, okay? I hate this movie!

    - A This is not just a film for baseball fans as it is a film about dreams and having the, come true. With an odd beginning of a man being told to build a random baseball field, he obeys and the fun begins with mysterious people playing ball and then the voices telling him to do other jobs which leads to one big connection between people from all around the U.S. James Earl Jones is a very memorable character as well as Ray Liotta and Costner as the man who builds it. The ending is one that makes you glad as he gets one wish come true. An excellent dreamy film.

    ***SPOILERS** Whimsical and heart warming story that uses the game of Baseball and the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox, forever known as the Chicago Black Sox, team as some kind of metaphor in bringing together transplanted from Brooklyn NY Iwoa farmer Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner, with his long dead father John, Dwier Brown, who passed away when Ray was 14. It was when walking through his corn field that Ray keeps hearing this voice telling him "That if you build it he will come". Thinking that he's suffering from a mild case of heat stroke Ray doesn't take it seriously until it, or the voice, shows him like a mirage in the desert a baseball diamond situated right in the middle of his cornfield! It's after when Ray bulldozed most of his cornfield under to build a baseball diamond and outfield following the instructions of the mysterious voice that his daughter Karin, Gabby Hoffman, notices a stranger wearing a baseball uniform hanging out on the field looking like he's lost! With Ray and his wife Annie, Amy Madigan, going to check things out it's discovered that the stranger, wearing a 1919 Chicago White Sox uniform,in non other the the great Shoeless Joe Jackson played by Ray Liotta. The most shocking thing about all this despite Shoeless Joe batting right-handed, he was in real life a left handed batter, the guy's been dead and buried for almost 40 years! Flabbergasted at what he as well as his wife Amy and daughter Karin are seeing Ray watches in stunned disbelief all the members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox emerge ,like ghosts in the night, out of his remaining corn field to play perpetual baseball without even bothering to eat or sleep! Completely under the spell of the mysterious voice Ray is told to travel to far off Boston and get in touch with 1960's activist and now in hiding and not talking or seeing anyone revolutionary and free love writer Terrence, his friends if he still has any call him Terry, Mann played by James Earl Jones. It's Ray's job according to the voice to not only take the at first very reluctant Mann to the Red Sox A's game at Fenway Park but also have the cash strapped Ray, who just about went broke building his baseball field, to treat him to a beer & hot dog! What the hell was all this about anyway? What's the reason for the voice to instruct Ray to do these mindless crazy and stupid things? We soon find out what's really going on in the movie when on the giant TV scoreboard over Fenway Park's right center field bleachers flashes the name Archibald "Moonlight" Graham and the place where he's supposed to be living Chisholm Minnisota that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only Ray & Mann could see! It's when both Ray and the now,in both seeing the light and hearing the voice, very agreeable Terry Mann, who at first thought that Ray was out of his mind, travel to Chisolm where they find out that Archie Garahm, Burt Lancaster, has been dead for the last 16 years! But that very pressing problem is solved with the two, Ray & Terry Mann, soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before Graham, who was the town doctor, kicked off and thus be able to talk to him! We later find out what Doc. Graham's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold: One for himself and the other and far more important reason for the Kinsella family! ***SPOILERS*** You've got to suspend belief watching "Field of Dreams" like everyone in it including Ray's brother in law Mark, Timothy Busfield, who at first thought that he and his sister Amy were nuts but later saw, when the 1919 White Sox revealed themselves to him, the light of "reality" and went along with the program! Touching and emotionally packed final when Ray gets to meet his dad John who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him! And while that's happening not only did he, Ray's dad John, come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire USA to fill the cornfield's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop. All that in order for them to watch both father and son together with the 1919 Chicago White Sox lead by Shoeless "Say it ain't So" Joe Jackson playing the great All American game of Baseball!

    I remember seeing this gem for the first time in the theatre and how it affected me emotionally. Had to be one of the best movies from the summer of 1989, this is an fantastic film from an even more fantastic book. The central theme of this movie is about regret and having the opportunity to get second chances. Even though the audience doesn't learn till the end of the movie what Kevin Costner's character's regret and redemption is, we experience some amazing and interesting co-starring wonderful characters (with Ray Liotta "Shoeless Joe" and Burt Lancaster's as the country doctor). The actors James Jones and Amy Madigan keep the storyline so well grounded, and only at the end of the movie does the magic we have been waiting for really take off. Kevin Costner is just brilliant to watch in this movie. This movie has to be one of his better performances that he has ever given. There was the potential to get all sappy and go over the top with his role, but much to my satisfaction he keeps everything even keel. Phil Robinson, the director, has created a wonderful movie with engrossing soundtrack combined with the most amazing and cinematic cinematography. Highly recommended for being a wonderful family movie.

    When i saw this movie for the first time in 1989 , i had previously been fairly distant , or i think the better word was indifferent, to both my parents up to that point after having moved out of the house in 1974. This movie was a wake up call and i started visiting my parents more and more thru the years and was glad that this movie came along to push me to get closer to my parents because in January 2012 , my mom passed away and 1 month later my father passed away. Think about the relationship you have with your parents when you watch this. Could it use a little improvement ? Think about how hard your parents worked to make you who you are today. Show them some appreciation , you'll be glad you did. It was this movie that made me get as much good quality time as i did prior to their passing. This movie isn't a baseball movie , its a movie about getting a second chance at repairing and enhancing your relationship with your father and actually , with both your parents. Without this movie , i would find myself sitting in a big vat of guilt and regrets. the main theme to this film...... redemption.

The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, "to me it wasn't a game, it was life." Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth. Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, "Hey, is this Heaven?" "No, it's Iowa." The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless. Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The "People Will Come, Ray" speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

    I don't think that you necessarily have to be a baseball fan to love this movie, but it sure doesn't hurt,, being a life long baseball fan it was very easy for me to relate to the movie. a man hears voices in the middle of his Iowa cornfield, telling him if you will build it they will come,, as he struggles with what he thinks he hears,, he has pressure coming down on him from the bank,, as he is behind on his mortgage payments on the house and farm.. nobody believes the voices he hears except for his little daughter at first. so he is told to build a baseball field.. and all of a sudden out of the shadows of the corn stalks come some of the greatest players every to play the game,,, they claim they just wanna keep playing somewhere,, Shoeless Joe Jackson is one of the heroes to come out of the cornstalk,, James Earl JOnes,, plays Terrence Mann a 60 's revolutionary who has gone into hiding the past 30 or so years,, our farmer goes to visit him, as he holds some clues as to what will happen next,, great family movie,, love this movie,,

    That doesn't work on multiple levels. Actors playing themselves,playing two dimensional cartoon characters, listless direction and a corny and boring premise. I just ejected the movie halfway through. This movie was embarrassing to watch, such was the lameness of the acting and direction in this movie. What's his name? James Earl Jones, pompously sleepwalking through a throw away characterization of zero importance to anybody. The woman who plays Costner's wife should win an Emmy for most annoying actress to ever grace the silver screen. Liotta was good in one movie ever, otherwise, more sleepwalking. Costner...what ever happened to him? Look, I'll be honest, okay? I hate this movie!

    - A This is not just a film for baseball fans as it is a film about dreams and having the, come true. With an odd beginning of a man being told to build a random baseball field, he obeys and the fun begins with mysterious people playing ball and then the voices telling him to do other jobs which leads to one big connection between people from all around the U.S. James Earl Jones is a very memorable character as well as Ray Liotta and Costner as the man who builds it. The ending is one that makes you glad as he gets one wish come true. An excellent dreamy film.

    ***SPOILERS** Whimsical and heart warming story that uses the game of Baseball and the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox, forever known as the Chicago Black Sox, team as some kind of metaphor in bringing together transplanted from Brooklyn NY Iwoa farmer Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner, with his long dead father John, Dwier Brown, who passed away when Ray was 14. It was when walking through his corn field that Ray keeps hearing this voice telling him "That if you build it he will come". Thinking that he's suffering from a mild case of heat stroke Ray doesn't take it seriously until it, or the voice, shows him like a mirage in the desert a baseball diamond situated right in the middle of his cornfield! It's after when Ray bulldozed most of his cornfield under to build a baseball diamond and outfield following the instructions of the mysterious voice that his daughter Karin, Gabby Hoffman, notices a stranger wearing a baseball uniform hanging out on the field looking like he's lost! With Ray and his wife Annie, Amy Madigan, going to check things out it's discovered that the stranger, wearing a 1919 Chicago White Sox uniform,in non other the the great Shoeless Joe Jackson played by Ray Liotta. The most shocking thing about all this despite Shoeless Joe batting right-handed, he was in real life a left handed batter, the guy's been dead and buried for almost 40 years! Flabbergasted at what he as well as his wife Amy and daughter Karin are seeing Ray watches in stunned disbelief all the members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox emerge ,like ghosts in the night, out of his remaining corn field to play perpetual baseball without even bothering to eat or sleep! Completely under the spell of the mysterious voice Ray is told to travel to far off Boston and get in touch with 1960's activist and now in hiding and not talking or seeing anyone revolutionary and free love writer Terrence, his friends if he still has any call him Terry, Mann played by James Earl Jones. It's Ray's job according to the voice to not only take the at first very reluctant Mann to the Red Sox A's game at Fenway Park but also have the cash strapped Ray, who just about went broke building his baseball field, to treat him to a beer & hot dog! What the hell was all this about anyway? What's the reason for the voice to instruct Ray to do these mindless crazy and stupid things? We soon find out what's really going on in the movie when on the giant TV scoreboard over Fenway Park's right center field bleachers flashes the name Archibald "Moonlight" Graham and the place where he's supposed to be living Chisholm Minnisota that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only Ray & Mann could see! It's when both Ray and the now,in both seeing the light and hearing the voice, very agreeable Terry Mann, who at first thought that Ray was out of his mind, travel to Chisolm where they find out that Archie Garahm, Burt Lancaster, has been dead for the last 16 years! But that very pressing problem is solved with the two, Ray & Terry Mann, soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before Graham, who was the town doctor, kicked off and thus be able to talk to him! We later find out what Doc. Graham's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold: One for himself and the other and far more important reason for the Kinsella family! ***SPOILERS*** You've got to suspend belief watching "Field of Dreams" like everyone in it including Ray's brother in law Mark, Timothy Busfield, who at first thought that he and his sister Amy were nuts but later saw, when the 1919 White Sox revealed themselves to him, the light of "reality" and went along with the program! Touching and emotionally packed final when Ray gets to meet his dad John who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him! And while that's happening not only did he, Ray's dad John, come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire USA to fill the cornfield's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop. All that in order for them to watch both father and son together with the 1919 Chicago White Sox lead by Shoeless "Say it ain't So" Joe Jackson playing the great All American game of Baseball!

    I remember seeing this gem for the first time in the theatre and how it affected me emotionally. Had to be one of the best movies from the summer of 1989, this is an fantastic film from an even more fantastic book. The central theme of this movie is about regret and having the opportunity to get second chances. Even though the audience doesn't learn till the end of the movie what Kevin Costner's character's regret and redemption is, we experience some amazing and interesting co-starring wonderful characters (with Ray Liotta "Shoeless Joe" and Burt Lancaster's as the country doctor). The actors James Jones and Amy Madigan keep the storyline so well grounded, and only at the end of the movie does the magic we have been waiting for really take off. Kevin Costner is just brilliant to watch in this movie. This movie has to be one of his better performances that he has ever given. There was the potential to get all sappy and go over the top with his role, but much to my satisfaction he keeps everything even keel. Phil Robinson, the director, has created a wonderful movie with engrossing soundtrack combined with the most amazing and cinematic cinematography. Highly recommended for being a wonderful family movie.

    When i saw this movie for the first time in 1989 , i had previously been fairly distant , or i think the better word was indifferent, to both my parents up to that point after having moved out of the house in 1974. This movie was a wake up call and i started visiting my parents more and more thru the years and was glad that this movie came along to push me to get closer to my parents because in January 2012 , my mom passed away and 1 month later my father passed away. Think about the relationship you have with your parents when you watch this. Could it use a little improvement ? Think about how hard your parents worked to make you who you are today. Show them some appreciation , you'll be glad you did. It was this movie that made me get as much good quality time as i did prior to their passing. This movie isn't a baseball movie , its a movie about getting a second chance at repairing and enhancing your relationship with your father and actually , with both your parents. Without this movie , i would find myself sitting in a big vat of guilt and regrets. the main theme to this film...... redemption.

    Let me start off by telling everyone that,my knowledge in baseball is almost in negative terms. I loved this movie!.. I have been wanting to see this movie for quite a while now,so when the opportunity presented itself,i didn't hesitate to take it.This probably is one of the best executed father-son movie of all time. The movie starts off without much off a prologue. We find ourselves,suddenly in the midst of an out of the world experience. But the strangest part is, that it all makes sense (in some weird way)..The acting is of course,extraordinary. But more than that,the direction is to be the most complimented part of this movie. I found myself crying,after the end of the movie..It truly is a feel good movie

    This is one of my favorite movies to watch. A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. A great gem for anyone. This is not just a baseball movie. It really hit home that it was just a awareness that we are all flawed, the expectations we have for our parents sometimes too high, especially when we grow up sometimes we aren't able to achieve. This is also about having a second chance to say hello to Dad. To enjoy doing something he enjoyed and and what his father before him enjoyed, but you were too young to maybe appreciate what that moment meant at the time. I had started to realize how much baseball is a American past time near the end of the movie after James Earl Jones speaks about it. I could watch it again and again not just for the sport but for the sheer fun of living through that moment that might not happen anymore unless you have your own kids.

    "Field of Dreams" embraces its own poetry with such daringness that only one epithet comes to my mind: perfect. The film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball, to what the game stands for in American culture. Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple: baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him "If you build it, he will come". This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of "Field of Dreams": it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919. And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is. And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. "Are you a ghost?" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. "Is this heaven?" he asks in return before leaving for the night, "No, It's Iowa." replies an overwhelmed Costner. The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': "Ease his pain", "Go the distance". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game. Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in "Field of Dreams" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen. And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, "Field of Dreams" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film. There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as "Field of Dreams" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.

    Put Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and baseball in a movie and you know I will watch it. There are not many things I love more in this world than baseball and movies. Field of Dreams is hands down the best baseball movie ever made. With the great acting from Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones is backed up by the great writing and interesting and mystical story. I first saw this movie when I was very young and The Voice scared me but I manned up and watched it, and I loved it. In case you don't know the story, Ray, a farmer from Iowa, hears a voice that changes his life. This embarks him on an adventure where dreams can come true and the sport of baseball ties in perfectly. Kevin Costner narrates the first scene and he gives am awesome backstory to Shoeless Joe Jackson, himself, his father, and his family. I love that scene for introducing everything we need to know about the movie. I never heard of Joe Jackson or the 1919 Black Sox Scandal so that was cool. The movie starts with the voice saying "If you build it, he will come," lines that everybody who has seen or even not seen the movie knows. These lines made this more than a baseball movie introducing mysticism and a higher power into the real world. The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, "to me it wasn't a game, it was life." Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth. Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, "Hey, is this Heaven?" "No, it's Iowa." The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless. Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The "People Will Come, Ray" speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

We soon find out what's really going on in the movie when on the giant TV scoreboard over Fenway Park's right center field bleachers flashes the name Archibald "Moonlight" Graham and the place where he's supposed to be living Chisholm Minnisota that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only Ray & Mann could see! It's when both Ray and the now,in both seeing the light and hearing the voice, very agreeable Terry Mann, who at first thought that Ray was out of his mind, travel to Chisolm where they find out that Archie Garahm, Burt Lancaster, has been dead for the last 16 years! But that very pressing problem is solved with the two, Ray & Terry Mann, soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before Graham, who was the town doctor, kicked off and thus be able to talk to him! We later find out what Doc. Graham's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold: One for himself and the other and far more important reason for the Kinsella family! ***SPOILERS*** You've got to suspend belief watching "Field of Dreams" like everyone in it including Ray's brother in law Mark, Timothy Busfield, who at first thought that he and his sister Amy were nuts but later saw, when the 1919 White Sox revealed themselves to him, the light of "reality" and went along with the program! Touching and emotionally packed final when Ray gets to meet his dad John who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him! And while that's happening not only did he, Ray's dad John, come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire USA to fill the cornfield's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop. All that in order for them to watch both father and son together with the 1919 Chicago White Sox lead by Shoeless "Say it ain't So" Joe Jackson playing the great All American game of Baseball!

    I remember seeing this gem for the first time in the theatre and how it affected me emotionally. Had to be one of the best movies from the summer of 1989, this is an fantastic film from an even more fantastic book. The central theme of this movie is about regret and having the opportunity to get second chances. Even though the audience doesn't learn till the end of the movie what Kevin Costner's character's regret and redemption is, we experience some amazing and interesting co-starring wonderful characters (with Ray Liotta "Shoeless Joe" and Burt Lancaster's as the country doctor). The actors James Jones and Amy Madigan keep the storyline so well grounded, and only at the end of the movie does the magic we have been waiting for really take off. Kevin Costner is just brilliant to watch in this movie. This movie has to be one of his better performances that he has ever given. There was the potential to get all sappy and go over the top with his role, but much to my satisfaction he keeps everything even keel. Phil Robinson, the director, has created a wonderful movie with engrossing soundtrack combined with the most amazing and cinematic cinematography. Highly recommended for being a wonderful family movie.

    When i saw this movie for the first time in 1989 , i had previously been fairly distant , or i think the better word was indifferent, to both my parents up to that point after having moved out of the house in 1974. This movie was a wake up call and i started visiting my parents more and more thru the years and was glad that this movie came along to push me to get closer to my parents because in January 2012 , my mom passed away and 1 month later my father passed away. Think about the relationship you have with your parents when you watch this. Could it use a little improvement ? Think about how hard your parents worked to make you who you are today. Show them some appreciation , you'll be glad you did. It was this movie that made me get as much good quality time as i did prior to their passing. This movie isn't a baseball movie , its a movie about getting a second chance at repairing and enhancing your relationship with your father and actually , with both your parents. Without this movie , i would find myself sitting in a big vat of guilt and regrets. the main theme to this film...... redemption.

    Let me start off by telling everyone that,my knowledge in baseball is almost in negative terms. I loved this movie!.. I have been wanting to see this movie for quite a while now,so when the opportunity presented itself,i didn't hesitate to take it.This probably is one of the best executed father-son movie of all time. The movie starts off without much off a prologue. We find ourselves,suddenly in the midst of an out of the world experience. But the strangest part is, that it all makes sense (in some weird way)..The acting is of course,extraordinary. But more than that,the direction is to be the most complimented part of this movie. I found myself crying,after the end of the movie..It truly is a feel good movie

    This is one of my favorite movies to watch. A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. A great gem for anyone. This is not just a baseball movie. It really hit home that it was just a awareness that we are all flawed, the expectations we have for our parents sometimes too high, especially when we grow up sometimes we aren't able to achieve. This is also about having a second chance to say hello to Dad. To enjoy doing something he enjoyed and and what his father before him enjoyed, but you were too young to maybe appreciate what that moment meant at the time. I had started to realize how much baseball is a American past time near the end of the movie after James Earl Jones speaks about it. I could watch it again and again not just for the sport but for the sheer fun of living through that moment that might not happen anymore unless you have your own kids.

    "Field of Dreams" embraces its own poetry with such daringness that only one epithet comes to my mind: perfect. The film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball, to what the game stands for in American culture. Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple: baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him "If you build it, he will come". This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of "Field of Dreams": it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919. And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is. And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. "Are you a ghost?" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. "Is this heaven?" he asks in return before leaving for the night, "No, It's Iowa." replies an overwhelmed Costner. The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': "Ease his pain", "Go the distance". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game. Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in "Field of Dreams" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen. And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, "Field of Dreams" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film. There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as "Field of Dreams" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.

    Put Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and baseball in a movie and you know I will watch it. There are not many things I love more in this world than baseball and movies. Field of Dreams is hands down the best baseball movie ever made. With the great acting from Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones is backed up by the great writing and interesting and mystical story. I first saw this movie when I was very young and The Voice scared me but I manned up and watched it, and I loved it. In case you don't know the story, Ray, a farmer from Iowa, hears a voice that changes his life. This embarks him on an adventure where dreams can come true and the sport of baseball ties in perfectly. Kevin Costner narrates the first scene and he gives am awesome backstory to Shoeless Joe Jackson, himself, his father, and his family. I love that scene for introducing everything we need to know about the movie. I never heard of Joe Jackson or the 1919 Black Sox Scandal so that was cool. The movie starts with the voice saying "If you build it, he will come," lines that everybody who has seen or even not seen the movie knows. These lines made this more than a baseball movie introducing mysticism and a higher power into the real world. The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, "to me it wasn't a game, it was life." Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth. Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, "Hey, is this Heaven?" "No, it's Iowa." The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless. Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The "People Will Come, Ray" speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

    I don't think that you necessarily have to be a baseball fan to love this movie, but it sure doesn't hurt,, being a life long baseball fan it was very easy for me to relate to the movie. a man hears voices in the middle of his Iowa cornfield, telling him if you will build it they will come,, as he struggles with what he thinks he hears,, he has pressure coming down on him from the bank,, as he is behind on his mortgage payments on the house and farm.. nobody believes the voices he hears except for his little daughter at first. so he is told to build a baseball field.. and all of a sudden out of the shadows of the corn stalks come some of the greatest players every to play the game,,, they claim they just wanna keep playing somewhere,, Shoeless Joe Jackson is one of the heroes to come out of the cornstalk,, James Earl JOnes,, plays Terrence Mann a 60 's revolutionary who has gone into hiding the past 30 or so years,, our farmer goes to visit him, as he holds some clues as to what will happen next,, great family movie,, love this movie,,

    That doesn't work on multiple levels. Actors playing themselves,playing two dimensional cartoon characters, listless direction and a corny and boring premise. I just ejected the movie halfway through. This movie was embarrassing to watch, such was the lameness of the acting and direction in this movie. What's his name? James Earl Jones, pompously sleepwalking through a throw away characterization of zero importance to anybody. The woman who plays Costner's wife should win an Emmy for most annoying actress to ever grace the silver screen. Liotta was good in one movie ever, otherwise, more sleepwalking. Costner...what ever happened to him? Look, I'll be honest, okay? I hate this movie!

    - A This is not just a film for baseball fans as it is a film about dreams and having the, come true. With an odd beginning of a man being told to build a random baseball field, he obeys and the fun begins with mysterious people playing ball and then the voices telling him to do other jobs which leads to one big connection between people from all around the U.S. James Earl Jones is a very memorable character as well as Ray Liotta and Costner as the man who builds it. The ending is one that makes you glad as he gets one wish come true. An excellent dreamy film.

    ***SPOILERS** Whimsical and heart warming story that uses the game of Baseball and the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox, forever known as the Chicago Black Sox, team as some kind of metaphor in bringing together transplanted from Brooklyn NY Iwoa farmer Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner, with his long dead father John, Dwier Brown, who passed away when Ray was 14. It was when walking through his corn field that Ray keeps hearing this voice telling him "That if you build it he will come". Thinking that he's suffering from a mild case of heat stroke Ray doesn't take it seriously until it, or the voice, shows him like a mirage in the desert a baseball diamond situated right in the middle of his cornfield! It's after when Ray bulldozed most of his cornfield under to build a baseball diamond and outfield following the instructions of the mysterious voice that his daughter Karin, Gabby Hoffman, notices a stranger wearing a baseball uniform hanging out on the field looking like he's lost! With Ray and his wife Annie, Amy Madigan, going to check things out it's discovered that the stranger, wearing a 1919 Chicago White Sox uniform,in non other the the great Shoeless Joe Jackson played by Ray Liotta. The most shocking thing about all this despite Shoeless Joe batting right-handed, he was in real life a left handed batter, the guy's been dead and buried for almost 40 years! Flabbergasted at what he as well as his wife Amy and daughter Karin are seeing Ray watches in stunned disbelief all the members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox emerge ,like ghosts in the night, out of his remaining corn field to play perpetual baseball without even bothering to eat or sleep! Completely under the spell of the mysterious voice Ray is told to travel to far off Boston and get in touch with 1960's activist and now in hiding and not talking or seeing anyone revolutionary and free love writer Terrence, his friends if he still has any call him Terry, Mann played by James Earl Jones. It's Ray's job according to the voice to not only take the at first very reluctant Mann to the Red Sox A's game at Fenway Park but also have the cash strapped Ray, who just about went broke building his baseball field, to treat him to a beer & hot dog! What the hell was all this about anyway? What's the reason for the voice to instruct Ray to do these mindless crazy and stupid things? We soon find out what's really going on in the movie when on the giant TV scoreboard over Fenway Park's right center field bleachers flashes the name Archibald "Moonlight" Graham and the place where he's supposed to be living Chisholm Minnisota that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only Ray & Mann could see! It's when both Ray and the now,in both seeing the light and hearing the voice, very agreeable Terry Mann, who at first thought that Ray was out of his mind, travel to Chisolm where they find out that Archie Garahm, Burt Lancaster, has been dead for the last 16 years! But that very pressing problem is solved with the two, Ray & Terry Mann, soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before Graham, who was the town doctor, kicked off and thus be able to talk to him! We later find out what Doc. Graham's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold: One for himself and the other and far more important reason for the Kinsella family! ***SPOILERS*** You've got to suspend belief watching "Field of Dreams" like everyone in it including Ray's brother in law Mark, Timothy Busfield, who at first thought that he and his sister Amy were nuts but later saw, when the 1919 White Sox revealed themselves to him, the light of "reality" and went along with the program! Touching and emotionally packed final when Ray gets to meet his dad John who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him! And while that's happening not only did he, Ray's dad John, come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire USA to fill the cornfield's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop. All that in order for them to watch both father and son together with the 1919 Chicago White Sox lead by Shoeless "Say it ain't So" Joe Jackson playing the great All American game of Baseball!

Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919. And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is. And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. "Are you a ghost?" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. "Is this heaven?" he asks in return before leaving for the night, "No, It's Iowa." replies an overwhelmed Costner. The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': "Ease his pain", "Go the distance". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game. Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in "Field of Dreams" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen. And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, "Field of Dreams" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film. There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as "Field of Dreams" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.

    Put Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and baseball in a movie and you know I will watch it. There are not many things I love more in this world than baseball and movies. Field of Dreams is hands down the best baseball movie ever made. With the great acting from Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones is backed up by the great writing and interesting and mystical story. I first saw this movie when I was very young and The Voice scared me but I manned up and watched it, and I loved it. In case you don't know the story, Ray, a farmer from Iowa, hears a voice that changes his life. This embarks him on an adventure where dreams can come true and the sport of baseball ties in perfectly. Kevin Costner narrates the first scene and he gives am awesome backstory to Shoeless Joe Jackson, himself, his father, and his family. I love that scene for introducing everything we need to know about the movie. I never heard of Joe Jackson or the 1919 Black Sox Scandal so that was cool. The movie starts with the voice saying "If you build it, he will come," lines that everybody who has seen or even not seen the movie knows. These lines made this more than a baseball movie introducing mysticism and a higher power into the real world. The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, "to me it wasn't a game, it was life." Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth. Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, "Hey, is this Heaven?" "No, it's Iowa." The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless. Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The "People Will Come, Ray" speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

    I don't think that you necessarily have to be a baseball fan to love this movie, but it sure doesn't hurt,, being a life long baseball fan it was very easy for me to relate to the movie. a man hears voices in the middle of his Iowa cornfield, telling him if you will build it they will come,, as he struggles with what he thinks he hears,, he has pressure coming down on him from the bank,, as he is behind on his mortgage payments on the house and farm.. nobody believes the voices he hears except for his little daughter at first. so he is told to build a baseball field.. and all of a sudden out of the shadows of the corn stalks come some of the greatest players every to play the game,,, they claim they just wanna keep playing somewhere,, Shoeless Joe Jackson is one of the heroes to come out of the cornstalk,, James Earl JOnes,, plays Terrence Mann a 60 's revolutionary who has gone into hiding the past 30 or so years,, our farmer goes to visit him, as he holds some clues as to what will happen next,, great family movie,, love this movie,,

    That doesn't work on multiple levels. Actors playing themselves,playing two dimensional cartoon characters, listless direction and a corny and boring premise. I just ejected the movie halfway through. This movie was embarrassing to watch, such was the lameness of the acting and direction in this movie. What's his name? James Earl Jones, pompously sleepwalking through a throw away characterization of zero importance to anybody. The woman who plays Costner's wife should win an Emmy for most annoying actress to ever grace the silver screen. Liotta was good in one movie ever, otherwise, more sleepwalking. Costner...what ever happened to him? Look, I'll be honest, okay? I hate this movie!

    - A This is not just a film for baseball fans as it is a film about dreams and having the, come true. With an odd beginning of a man being told to build a random baseball field, he obeys and the fun begins with mysterious people playing ball and then the voices telling him to do other jobs which leads to one big connection between people from all around the U.S. James Earl Jones is a very memorable character as well as Ray Liotta and Costner as the man who builds it. The ending is one that makes you glad as he gets one wish come true. An excellent dreamy film.

    ***SPOILERS** Whimsical and heart warming story that uses the game of Baseball and the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox, forever known as the Chicago Black Sox, team as some kind of metaphor in bringing together transplanted from Brooklyn NY Iwoa farmer Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner, with his long dead father John, Dwier Brown, who passed away when Ray was 14. It was when walking through his corn field that Ray keeps hearing this voice telling him "That if you build it he will come". Thinking that he's suffering from a mild case of heat stroke Ray doesn't take it seriously until it, or the voice, shows him like a mirage in the desert a baseball diamond situated right in the middle of his cornfield! It's after when Ray bulldozed most of his cornfield under to build a baseball diamond and outfield following the instructions of the mysterious voice that his daughter Karin, Gabby Hoffman, notices a stranger wearing a baseball uniform hanging out on the field looking like he's lost! With Ray and his wife Annie, Amy Madigan, going to check things out it's discovered that the stranger, wearing a 1919 Chicago White Sox uniform,in non other the the great Shoeless Joe Jackson played by Ray Liotta. The most shocking thing about all this despite Shoeless Joe batting right-handed, he was in real life a left handed batter, the guy's been dead and buried for almost 40 years! Flabbergasted at what he as well as his wife Amy and daughter Karin are seeing Ray watches in stunned disbelief all the members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox emerge ,like ghosts in the night, out of his remaining corn field to play perpetual baseball without even bothering to eat or sleep! Completely under the spell of the mysterious voice Ray is told to travel to far off Boston and get in touch with 1960's activist and now in hiding and not talking or seeing anyone revolutionary and free love writer Terrence, his friends if he still has any call him Terry, Mann played by James Earl Jones. It's Ray's job according to the voice to not only take the at first very reluctant Mann to the Red Sox A's game at Fenway Park but also have the cash strapped Ray, who just about went broke building his baseball field, to treat him to a beer & hot dog! What the hell was all this about anyway? What's the reason for the voice to instruct Ray to do these mindless crazy and stupid things? We soon find out what's really going on in the movie when on the giant TV scoreboard over Fenway Park's right center field bleachers flashes the name Archibald "Moonlight" Graham and the place where he's supposed to be living Chisholm Minnisota that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only Ray & Mann could see! It's when both Ray and the now,in both seeing the light and hearing the voice, very agreeable Terry Mann, who at first thought that Ray was out of his mind, travel to Chisolm where they find out that Archie Garahm, Burt Lancaster, has been dead for the last 16 years! But that very pressing problem is solved with the two, Ray & Terry Mann, soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before Graham, who was the town doctor, kicked off and thus be able to talk to him! We later find out what Doc. Graham's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold: One for himself and the other and far more important reason for the Kinsella family! ***SPOILERS*** You've got to suspend belief watching "Field of Dreams" like everyone in it including Ray's brother in law Mark, Timothy Busfield, who at first thought that he and his sister Amy were nuts but later saw, when the 1919 White Sox revealed themselves to him, the light of "reality" and went along with the program! Touching and emotionally packed final when Ray gets to meet his dad John who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him! And while that's happening not only did he, Ray's dad John, come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire USA to fill the cornfield's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop. All that in order for them to watch both father and son together with the 1919 Chicago White Sox lead by Shoeless "Say it ain't So" Joe Jackson playing the great All American game of Baseball!

    I remember seeing this gem for the first time in the theatre and how it affected me emotionally. Had to be one of the best movies from the summer of 1989, this is an fantastic film from an even more fantastic book. The central theme of this movie is about regret and having the opportunity to get second chances. Even though the audience doesn't learn till the end of the movie what Kevin Costner's character's regret and redemption is, we experience some amazing and interesting co-starring wonderful characters (with Ray Liotta "Shoeless Joe" and Burt Lancaster's as the country doctor). The actors James Jones and Amy Madigan keep the storyline so well grounded, and only at the end of the movie does the magic we have been waiting for really take off. Kevin Costner is just brilliant to watch in this movie. This movie has to be one of his better performances that he has ever given. There was the potential to get all sappy and go over the top with his role, but much to my satisfaction he keeps everything even keel. Phil Robinson, the director, has created a wonderful movie with engrossing soundtrack combined with the most amazing and cinematic cinematography. Highly recommended for being a wonderful family movie.

    When i saw this movie for the first time in 1989 , i had previously been fairly distant , or i think the better word was indifferent, to both my parents up to that point after having moved out of the house in 1974. This movie was a wake up call and i started visiting my parents more and more thru the years and was glad that this movie came along to push me to get closer to my parents because in January 2012 , my mom passed away and 1 month later my father passed away. Think about the relationship you have with your parents when you watch this. Could it use a little improvement ? Think about how hard your parents worked to make you who you are today. Show them some appreciation , you'll be glad you did. It was this movie that made me get as much good quality time as i did prior to their passing. This movie isn't a baseball movie , its a movie about getting a second chance at repairing and enhancing your relationship with your father and actually , with both your parents. Without this movie , i would find myself sitting in a big vat of guilt and regrets. the main theme to this film...... redemption.

    Let me start off by telling everyone that,my knowledge in baseball is almost in negative terms. I loved this movie!.. I have been wanting to see this movie for quite a while now,so when the opportunity presented itself,i didn't hesitate to take it.This probably is one of the best executed father-son movie of all time. The movie starts off without much off a prologue. We find ourselves,suddenly in the midst of an out of the world experience. But the strangest part is, that it all makes sense (in some weird way)..The acting is of course,extraordinary. But more than that,the direction is to be the most complimented part of this movie. I found myself crying,after the end of the movie..It truly is a feel good movie

    This is one of my favorite movies to watch. A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. A great gem for anyone. This is not just a baseball movie. It really hit home that it was just a awareness that we are all flawed, the expectations we have for our parents sometimes too high, especially when we grow up sometimes we aren't able to achieve. This is also about having a second chance to say hello to Dad. To enjoy doing something he enjoyed and and what his father before him enjoyed, but you were too young to maybe appreciate what that moment meant at the time. I had started to realize how much baseball is a American past time near the end of the movie after James Earl Jones speaks about it. I could watch it again and again not just for the sport but for the sheer fun of living through that moment that might not happen anymore unless you have your own kids.

    "Field of Dreams" embraces its own poetry with such daringness that only one epithet comes to my mind: perfect. The film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball, to what the game stands for in American culture. Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple: baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him "If you build it, he will come". This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of "Field of Dreams": it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919. And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is. And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. "Are you a ghost?" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. "Is this heaven?" he asks in return before leaving for the night, "No, It's Iowa." replies an overwhelmed Costner. The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': "Ease his pain", "Go the distance". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game. Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in "Field of Dreams" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen. And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, "Field of Dreams" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film. There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as "Field of Dreams" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.

    I don't think that you necessarily have to be a baseball fan to love this movie, but it sure doesn't hurt,, being a life long baseball fan it was very easy for me to relate to the movie. a man hears voices in the middle of his Iowa cornfield, telling him if you will build it they will come,, as he struggles with what he thinks he hears,, he has pressure coming down on him from the bank,, as he is behind on his mortgage payments on the house and farm.. nobody believes the voices he hears except for his little daughter at first. so he is told to build a baseball field.. and all of a sudden out of the shadows of the corn stalks come some of the greatest players every to play the game,,, they claim they just wanna keep playing somewhere,, Shoeless Joe Jackson is one of the heroes to come out of the cornstalk,, James Earl JOnes,, plays Terrence Mann a 60 's revolutionary who has gone into hiding the past 30 or so years,, our farmer goes to visit him, as he holds some clues as to what will happen next,, great family movie,, love this movie,,

    That doesn't work on multiple levels. Actors playing themselves,playing two dimensional cartoon characters, listless direction and a corny and boring premise. I just ejected the movie halfway through. This movie was embarrassing to watch, such was the lameness of the acting and direction in this movie. What's his name? James Earl Jones, pompously sleepwalking through a throw away characterization of zero importance to anybody. The woman who plays Costner's wife should win an Emmy for most annoying actress to ever grace the silver screen. Liotta was good in one movie ever, otherwise, more sleepwalking. Costner...what ever happened to him? Look, I'll be honest, okay? I hate this movie!

    - A This is not just a film for baseball fans as it is a film about dreams and having the, come true. With an odd beginning of a man being told to build a random baseball field, he obeys and the fun begins with mysterious people playing ball and then the voices telling him to do other jobs which leads to one big connection between people from all around the U.S. James Earl Jones is a very memorable character as well as Ray Liotta and Costner as the man who builds it. The ending is one that makes you glad as he gets one wish come true. An excellent dreamy film.

    ***SPOILERS** Whimsical and heart warming story that uses the game of Baseball and the infamous 1919 Chicago White Sox, forever known as the Chicago Black Sox, team as some kind of metaphor in bringing together transplanted from Brooklyn NY Iwoa farmer Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner, with his long dead father John, Dwier Brown, who passed away when Ray was 14. It was when walking through his corn field that Ray keeps hearing this voice telling him "That if you build it he will come". Thinking that he's suffering from a mild case of heat stroke Ray doesn't take it seriously until it, or the voice, shows him like a mirage in the desert a baseball diamond situated right in the middle of his cornfield! It's after when Ray bulldozed most of his cornfield under to build a baseball diamond and outfield following the instructions of the mysterious voice that his daughter Karin, Gabby Hoffman, notices a stranger wearing a baseball uniform hanging out on the field looking like he's lost! With Ray and his wife Annie, Amy Madigan, going to check things out it's discovered that the stranger, wearing a 1919 Chicago White Sox uniform,in non other the the great Shoeless Joe Jackson played by Ray Liotta. The most shocking thing about all this despite Shoeless Joe batting right-handed, he was in real life a left handed batter, the guy's been dead and buried for almost 40 years! Flabbergasted at what he as well as his wife Amy and daughter Karin are seeing Ray watches in stunned disbelief all the members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox emerge ,like ghosts in the night, out of his remaining corn field to play perpetual baseball without even bothering to eat or sleep! Completely under the spell of the mysterious voice Ray is told to travel to far off Boston and get in touch with 1960's activist and now in hiding and not talking or seeing anyone revolutionary and free love writer Terrence, his friends if he still has any call him Terry, Mann played by James Earl Jones. It's Ray's job according to the voice to not only take the at first very reluctant Mann to the Red Sox A's game at Fenway Park but also have the cash strapped Ray, who just about went broke building his baseball field, to treat him to a beer & hot dog! What the hell was all this about anyway? What's the reason for the voice to instruct Ray to do these mindless crazy and stupid things? We soon find out what's really going on in the movie when on the giant TV scoreboard over Fenway Park's right center field bleachers flashes the name Archibald "Moonlight" Graham and the place where he's supposed to be living Chisholm Minnisota that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only Ray & Mann could see! It's when both Ray and the now,in both seeing the light and hearing the voice, very agreeable Terry Mann, who at first thought that Ray was out of his mind, travel to Chisolm where they find out that Archie Garahm, Burt Lancaster, has been dead for the last 16 years! But that very pressing problem is solved with the two, Ray & Terry Mann, soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before Graham, who was the town doctor, kicked off and thus be able to talk to him! We later find out what Doc. Graham's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold: One for himself and the other and far more important reason for the Kinsella family! ***SPOILERS*** You've got to suspend belief watching "Field of Dreams" like everyone in it including Ray's brother in law Mark, Timothy Busfield, who at first thought that he and his sister Amy were nuts but later saw, when the 1919 White Sox revealed themselves to him, the light of "reality" and went along with the program! Touching and emotionally packed final when Ray gets to meet his dad John who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him! And while that's happening not only did he, Ray's dad John, come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire USA to fill the cornfield's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop. All that in order for them to watch both father and son together with the 1919 Chicago White Sox lead by Shoeless "Say it ain't So" Joe Jackson playing the great All American game of Baseball!

    I remember seeing this gem for the first time in the theatre and how it affected me emotionally. Had to be one of the best movies from the summer of 1989, this is an fantastic film from an even more fantastic book. The central theme of this movie is about regret and having the opportunity to get second chances. Even though the audience doesn't learn till the end of the movie what Kevin Costner's character's regret and redemption is, we experience some amazing and interesting co-starring wonderful characters (with Ray Liotta "Shoeless Joe" and Burt Lancaster's as the country doctor). The actors James Jones and Amy Madigan keep the storyline so well grounded, and only at the end of the movie does the magic we have been waiting for really take off. Kevin Costner is just brilliant to watch in this movie. This movie has to be one of his better performances that he has ever given. There was the potential to get all sappy and go over the top with his role, but much to my satisfaction he keeps everything even keel. Phil Robinson, the director, has created a wonderful movie with engrossing soundtrack combined with the most amazing and cinematic cinematography. Highly recommended for being a wonderful family movie.

    When i saw this movie for the first time in 1989 , i had previously been fairly distant , or i think the better word was indifferent, to both my parents up to that point after having moved out of the house in 1974. This movie was a wake up call and i started visiting my parents more and more thru the years and was glad that this movie came along to push me to get closer to my parents because in January 2012 , my mom passed away and 1 month later my father passed away. Think about the relationship you have with your parents when you watch this. Could it use a little improvement ? Think about how hard your parents worked to make you who you are today. Show them some appreciation , you'll be glad you did. It was this movie that made me get as much good quality time as i did prior to their passing. This movie isn't a baseball movie , its a movie about getting a second chance at repairing and enhancing your relationship with your father and actually , with both your parents. Without this movie , i would find myself sitting in a big vat of guilt and regrets. the main theme to this film...... redemption.

    Let me start off by telling everyone that,my knowledge in baseball is almost in negative terms. I loved this movie!.. I have been wanting to see this movie for quite a while now,so when the opportunity presented itself,i didn't hesitate to take it.This probably is one of the best executed father-son movie of all time. The movie starts off without much off a prologue. We find ourselves,suddenly in the midst of an out of the world experience. But the strangest part is, that it all makes sense (in some weird way)..The acting is of course,extraordinary. But more than that,the direction is to be the most complimented part of this movie. I found myself crying,after the end of the movie..It truly is a feel good movie

    This is one of my favorite movies to watch. A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. A great gem for anyone. This is not just a baseball movie. It really hit home that it was just a awareness that we are all flawed, the expectations we have for our parents sometimes too high, especially when we grow up sometimes we aren't able to achieve. This is also about having a second chance to say hello to Dad. To enjoy doing something he enjoyed and and what his father before him enjoyed, but you were too young to maybe appreciate what that moment meant at the time. I had started to realize how much baseball is a American past time near the end of the movie after James Earl Jones speaks about it. I could watch it again and again not just for the sport but for the sheer fun of living through that moment that might not happen anymore unless you have your own kids.

    "Field of Dreams" embraces its own poetry with such daringness that only one epithet comes to my mind: perfect. The film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball, to what the game stands for in American culture. Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple: baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him "If you build it, he will come". This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of "Field of Dreams": it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919. And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is. And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. "Are you a ghost?" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. "Is this heaven?" he asks in return before leaving for the night, "No, It's Iowa." replies an overwhelmed Costner. The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': "Ease his pain", "Go the distance". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game. Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in "Field of Dreams" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen. And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, "Field of Dreams" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film. There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as "Field of Dreams" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.

    Put Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and baseball in a movie and you know I will watch it. There are not many things I love more in this world than baseball and movies. Field of Dreams is hands down the best baseball movie ever made. With the great acting from Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones is backed up by the great writing and interesting and mystical story. I first saw this movie when I was very young and The Voice scared me but I manned up and watched it, and I loved it. In case you don't know the story, Ray, a farmer from Iowa, hears a voice that changes his life. This embarks him on an adventure where dreams can come true and the sport of baseball ties in perfectly. Kevin Costner narrates the first scene and he gives am awesome backstory to Shoeless Joe Jackson, himself, his father, and his family. I love that scene for introducing everything we need to know about the movie. I never heard of Joe Jackson or the 1919 Black Sox Scandal so that was cool. The movie starts with the voice saying "If you build it, he will come," lines that everybody who has seen or even not seen the movie knows. These lines made this more than a baseball movie introducing mysticism and a higher power into the real world. The voice scared me and in a way it still does, its creepy and I put myself in Ray's position and I don't know what I would have done. My favorite scene is the first scene with Ray and Joe Jackson. Ray follows his gut and the voice by deciding to plow over a chunk of his corn to build a baseball field. He built it, and Shoeless Joe came. The scene itself is subtle as Jackson stands in left field, his actual position when he played, Ray then picks up a bat and hits balls to him. After a few hits Jackson comes in they talk a little and then Jackson takes the bat and he hits. There is no music in this scene, it is the natural sounds of the night and the crack of the bat. It was beautifully shot and the sound captured the imagination of the situation. Ray was pitching to a ghost. Then the writing came in. The way Jackson described the game of baseball was perfect. He says something along the lines of, "to me it wasn't a game, it was life." Being a huge fan of baseball I know exactly what he means and he was so right. The voice comes back and brings Costner to Boston to find James Earl Jones. The field took a huge chunk out of their money and Ray was going broke. This added the major conflict in the story. It is a race against time and money so Ray takes a bigger risk and goes to Boston to find Terrance Mann. Terrance Mann is an author from the 60s and this movie ties so many generations together so well. The old days with Jackson, the 60s with Mann and the present day of the film. Mann also has a strong connection with baseball so he ties in perfectly. James Earl Jones brings his loud and strong voice to this character. This is my favorite role he has played as his character has so much depth. Nothing made me happier than seeing old Fenway without the green monster seats. Fenway Park is the best stadium in major league baseball and was the perfect choice for this movie, and that's coming from a Yankee fan. They could have went for Yankee Stadium and possible touched on the history of the stadium and the sport, but no, they chose Fenway and I couldn't have been happier. The mind boggling in this movie is crazy with the twists and turns are hard to believe. There are elements of time travel and what is in the corn field which I am still trying to figure out. Another famous quote, "Hey, is this Heaven?" "No, it's Iowa." The fact that they deny that its heaven is interesting because to the men the field affected it seemed like heaven. I would have called it heaven. Ray's brother-in-law can't see the player so that is an interesting factor that obviously is used to keep the problem relevant but other than that this movie is flawless. Overall, Field of Dreams is one of the best movies ever made. It molded careers in Costner and made James Earl Jones' even greater. The "People Will Come, Ray" speech was one I could listen to over and over and is another piece of beautiful writing. The description of baseball and the effects it has on people is 100% true. The score to this movie is also fantastic and fits each scene perfectly. Field of Dreams is a baseball story but also so much more so for that it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

    When i saw this movie for the first time in 1989 , i had previously been fairly distant , or i think the better word was indifferent, to both my parents up to that point after having moved out of the house in 1974. This movie was a wake up call and i started visiting my parents more and more thru the years and was glad that this movie came along to push me to get closer to my parents because in January 2012 , my mom passed away and 1 month later my father passed away. Think about the relationship you have with your parents when you watch this. Could it use a little improvement ? Think about how hard your parents worked to make you who you are today. Show them some appreciation , you'll be glad you did. It was this movie that made me get as much good quality time as i did prior to their passing. This movie isn't a baseball movie , its a movie about getting a second chance at repairing and enhancing your relationship with your father and actually , with both your parents. Without this movie , i would find myself sitting in a big vat of guilt and regrets. the main theme to this film...... redemption.

    Let me start off by telling everyone that,my knowledge in baseball is almost in negative terms. I loved this movie!.. I have been wanting to see this movie for quite a while now,so when the opportunity presented itself,i didn't hesitate to take it.This probably is one of the best executed father-son movie of all time. The movie starts off without much off a prologue. We find ourselves,suddenly in the midst of an out of the world experience. But the strangest part is, that it all makes sense (in some weird way)..The acting is of course,extraordinary. But more than that,the direction is to be the most complimented part of this movie. I found myself crying,after the end of the movie..It truly is a feel good movie

    This is one of my favorite movies to watch. A movie with no guns, violence, gangsters, no gratuitous sex, just down-to-earth good people, and a good message. A great gem for anyone. This is not just a baseball movie. It really hit home that it was just a awareness that we are all flawed, the expectations we have for our parents sometimes too high, especially when we grow up sometimes we aren't able to achieve. This is also about having a second chance to say hello to Dad. To enjoy doing something he enjoyed and and what his father before him enjoyed, but you were too young to maybe appreciate what that moment meant at the time. I had started to realize how much baseball is a American past time near the end of the movie after James Earl Jones speaks about it. I could watch it again and again not just for the sport but for the sheer fun of living through that moment that might not happen anymore unless you have your own kids.

    "Field of Dreams" embraces its own poetry with such daringness that only one epithet comes to my mind: perfect. The film pays a wonderful tribute to baseball, to what the game stands for in American culture. Yet I'm not American and I remember how mesmerized I was by the story, when I saw it the first time with my Dad, when I was only nine. The reason is simple: baseball is the setting, the atmosphere, the reason-to-be of the story, but apart from that, Phil Alden Anderson's masterpiece speaks much more universal statements about life and dreams. And when I saw it on that magical night, I remember we were both enthralled by the opening scene, when Kevin Costner was walking across his cornfield, and heard the mysterious voice whispering to him "If you build it, he will come". This line was probably the first I ever strongly remembered from a movie. I believe this says a lot about the power of "Field of Dreams": it has the kind of universal appeal that a child can respond to, the idea that the greatest accomplishments can indeed come from nowhere, that we all have some guardian angels guiding our actions and showing us the paths to take. The dream-like escapism is magnificently incarnated through the breathtaking beauty of Iowa's farm, a vast landscape where the colors of the sky marry the sunlight in such a dazzling harmony that it's a mystery that the film didn't get one Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. Anyways, when Ray hears the voice, he doesn't know what to do until a very explicit vision finally appears. He understands the message, if he builds a baseball diamond, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson will come. The film goes deeper on the Oedipal significance of Jackson, who was the idol of John, Ray's father. John Kinsella was more than 50 years older than Ray, and both hardly got any connection apart from their mutual love for baseball. And it's unfortunately through baseball that Ray expressed his hostility by refusing to play catch with his dad and telling him that his hero was a criminal, referring to the White Sox players who were banned when the World Series was fixed in 1919. And the 'White Sox' scandal is the symbol of what the film is all about: lost dreams. These eight players couldn't play baseball for life, their only dreams were to feel the grass again under their shoes, to breath the wind blowing on the fields and to play, just play. Ray never did anything crazy or substantial in his life -he studied, graduated, lived the sixties, smoked pot, marched then settled in a farm- he believes this is a real opportunity to do something. Ray's biggest fear is to end up like his father who never achieved anything, in a poignant bed conversation with his wife, played by Amy Madigan, Ray decides to build a baseball diamond, no matter how costly it is. And as silly as the idea sounds, his wife supports him, because she understands the value of marriage is also to encourage the one we love to pursue his dream. Naturally, the film evokes the financial problems and the repercussions on Ray's cornfield but the essential is what happens on the field. And after a few months, when the first baseball player appears, when Jackson (Ray Liotta) discovers the field, we know we're unto something magical, never explored in any other film. "Are you a ghost?" asks little Karin (Gaby Hoffman) with curiosity. "Is this heaven?" he asks in return before leaving for the night, "No, It's Iowa." replies an overwhelmed Costner. The baseball diamond becomes a sort of intersection between Heaven and Earth, the universal spot where dreams are fulfilled, when second chances are given. As the film progresses, more and more players come to play, and Ray receives new messages from 'the voice': "Ease his pain", "Go the distance". A strange and curious odyssey leads him to an influential writer of the 60's, played by James Earl Jones, and to an ex-baseball player who had only one game before he retired and became a doctor. 'Moonlight' Archie Graham, now dead, would give anything to play baseball again, much more with his hero, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, but in fact, just playing the game. Burt Lancaster delivers his last performance in "Field of Dreams" as Doc Graham, a man who didn't live wondering why he became a doctor, but what if he played one more time in his life, how thrilling it would be. The Doc is dead since 1972 but Ray finds him while wondering in the streets, and then hitchhiking as a young rookie played by Frank Whaley. At this point, we don't ask questions, we don't wonder why this or that happens, it's all part of the same irrational logic, something guided by mysterious forces. The voice, the vision, the ghosts, we accept them because they're positive, because we feel something magical ought to happen. And magical is an understatement, from the wonderful speech delivered by Jones' unique voice to the last encounter that gives the key to all the mystery surrounding the story, "Field of Dreams" ends with the perfect emotional pay-off to one of the most extraordinary journeys into the magic of sport, inspiring the best of human spirit: playing, sharing, connecting: you throw, I catch, giving and taking, the language of the heart in its purest form. It's not just one of the greatest baseball movies, but one of the best sports movie ever made. Still, there's much more in the film. There's the idea that we all must pursue our dreams and tell people we love what we really feel, that no matter what they achieved or didn't, we love and care for them  because as enchanting and inspiring as "Field of Dreams" is, it's a fantasy and no matter what we build, some will never come.
