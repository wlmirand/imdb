    George Lucas' forgotten comedy-mystery is a masterful work for those who understand what it is. Radioland Murders is not a spoof or a parody of a 1930s comedy, as many people suppose. It is, literally, a 1930s comedy! Meaning, of course, that it is written as if it is a 1930s comedy, with physical gags and witty dialogue straight from the Golden Age of the 30s. Think about The Thin Man, or Abbott and Costello, or a Bert Lahr film, or You Can't Take It With You. If you love those films, you will love this movie. If you've never heard of those films, then you may find it hard to understand exactly what George Lucas was doing. Brian Benben and Mary Stuart Masterson head up an all-star cast in pure 1930s fashion, as people one by one begin to die off during the opening night of a new radio station. The antics are wholly 30s, with plenty of running into doors, falling out of chairs, and lots of humorous chatter that one might call "intelligent humor" (you have to be listening in order to find it funny). You won't be rolling on the floor in hysterics, because 1930s humor wasn't that sort of humor. You don't roar with laughter when you watch The Thin Man, but you chuckle at the clever dialogue and amusing antics of the characters, in a more refined way which characterized the manners of the era. As with all his movies such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones, George Lucas pays great homage to the Golden Age of cinema, and Radioland Murders is no exception. It is a fun, rollicking film, not for a mass audience, perhaps, but for those who enjoy the sophisticated humor from the 30s and 40s, a genre that is seldom, if ever, seen in comedy today.

    I remember watching this in the theater and it being so funny (for so long) that I couldn't breath I was laughing so much. Both my girlfriend and I had to look at the floor of the theater to look away from the screen to try and reduce our laughing because our sides hurt so much. Maybe if I watched it again I might not laugh quite so much but I remember laughing more at this movie than any other. And no, I wasn't a silly teenager at the time, I was in my 30's. I loved the fast, fast pace and the constant stream of jokes and sight gags. It does help if you can pay attention and keep track of everything that is going on. This is not a sophisticated comedy by any means, just a lot of good, clean fun (well, except for the murders). ;-) Just a (very) lot of fun.

    Going in, Radioland Murders has some key elements that could of made for an entertaining story: all-star cast in a screwball comedy and an nostalgic storyline that could put to use a colorful set. But it all failed. The joke delivery was flat and some of the casting choices were peculiar. Watching Mary Stuart Masterson struggle through the lead female role made me long for Jennifer Jason Leigh's brilliant, high-spirited, cigarette-chomping, Hepburn-inspired career girl in the Coens' Hudsucker Proxy. Also Brian Benben, most notable from HBO's "Dream On" series, doesn't give viewers any of maligned everyman he popularized in the older series. This movie attempts many times to emulate that 40s-era world, with its Art Deco imagery, but the characters come off more cartoonish than swashbuckling. There are far better period comedies, I suggest "My Favorite Year" starring Peter O'Toole; "Radio Days" by Woody Allen and the aforementioned Hudsucker just to name a few. Those films succeed where Radioland fails, pulling viewers into these bygone eras to feel an inkling of what those times felt and sounded like.

    The year was 1939 and America was in the flux of world wide change. Hitler was in Germany, Roosevelt was in the White House and a New Radio station was inaugurating it's first night on the air-waves. There are a hundred things which could go wrong and after watching this film for just a few minutes, the audience will indeed come to that conclusion. In the mist of growing chaos, personal problems also are thrown in the mix. Mr. Roger Henderson, (Brian Benben) in trying to win back his wife Penny (Mary Masterson) who threatens him with divorce. At the same time, the radio station employees are confronted with murder as several top executives are found dead. Several key characters add to the general mayhem such as General Whalen (Ned Beatty), Billy The Gopher, (Scott Campbell) Michael Lerner (Michael Cross) Zolttan (Christopher Lloyd) Herman Katsenback (Larry Miller), Billy Barty, Bobcat Goldthwait and Robert Walden. Director Mel Smith and writer George Lucas even threw in the Late George Burns. The station is flooded with everything from on stage Key-stone slap-stick, pratfalls, sight gags, verbal innuendos and hilarious vaudeville entertainment. The center of the story are the mysterious murders which are complex and interesting. All in all, the movie is wondrously exciting and musically entertaining. A fun visit to a far-away place where imagination of voice could transport you to anytime and place. Offered to anyone seeking a slice of radio memorabilia. ****

    I think the key to appreciating this movie is in your expectations. The first time I saw it I didn't like it that much but repeat viewings have made it one of my favorite comedies. It helps that I really like old timey radio shows, but that is not a prerequisite to enjoying the film. This movie moves fast, and I think that's one thing that throws a lot of people. Modern comedies tend to have a relaxed pace and an improvisational feel, but Radioland Murders keeps a break-neck, gag-a-minute pace. The jokes fly so fast you're liable to miss them. It almost moves too fast. For example, all the character relationships are laid out in the first five minutes before the main title even appears. If you blink you might fall behind. But if you can keep up the movie pays off in spades. The one complaint I do have is that the movie has so many talented actors it gives many of them very little to do. Some of the funniest (and most famous) actors die off before they get more than a few lines. But overall if you like machine-gun dialogue, screwball comedy, and lots of pratfalls, this is a hilarious movie.

    This movie takes us back 70 years ago at the City of Chicago, where station WBN hosts the variety of many radio programs. Unfortunately, it's also the place of interest where six murders are committed. Brian Benben stars as hapless writer Roger Henderson, who tries to solve the murders of stool-pigeon trumpet player Ruffles Reedy(Jack Sheldon), Toupee wearing Director Walt Whalen Jr.(Jeffery Tambor), Bossy Stage Manager Herman Katzenback(Larry Miller), Sleazy Radio Announcer Dexter Morris(Corbin Bernsen), humorless sponsor Bernie King(Brion James), and WBN Head Man General Walt Whalen(Ned Beatty). Accused of being the killer by Short-Tempered Lt. Cross(Michael Lerner), he, along with bell boy Billy(Scott M. Campbell) and his wife Penny Henderson(Mary S. Masterson), must find out who committed the murders and why. It features appearances by well-known comedian George Burns as the 100-year-experienced radio comedian Milt Lackey, Anita Morris' last appearance as the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl with the Va-Va-Va-Voom voice Claudette Katzenback, Christopher Lloyd as the sound effects man Zoltan, and Peter MacNicol(who is known for his starring role in the Mr. Bean Movie) as the son of one of the writers. To find out who the killer really is... You'll have to watch the movie. This movie is a nostalgia of classic radio and mystery with a dash of LOL. I guarantee you'll like this movie! 1000/1000

    The only thing that this inane film has going for it is its pacing. It is done lively and quiet fast and given the nature and how bad the film is, it's appropriate to do it that quickly. This is a definite take-off on the radio period in America. While a radio show goes on, the best part of the action seems to be on the backstage, where a series of murders are taking place, one after the other. Suspicion immediately falls on one of the writers who is on the verge of breaking up with his wife, the show's producer. The beginning showed progress with the problems of script writing presented. With the murders, the film falters quickly and becomes one of amateurish slapstick and all other mayhem and nonsense. The comedy lines are silly. One example is: Woman to man: "Don't you see the star on my dressing room?" His response was: "Does that mean you're Jewish?" Case closed.

    If you like the old radio shows, films set in the '30s and mysteries, this should be the film for you. The three things mentioned are favorite things of mine, but alas, I didn't enjoy this movie. The thin plot centers around a Phantom of the Radio (a disembodied voice) who says something sinister over a microphone, and then someone is murdered. Apparently all the people who are murdered worked together at another radio station that was involved in a scandal. One of the writers, Roger Henderson (Brian Benben becomes a suspect. He's the husband - possibly soon to be ex-husband of Penny Henderson (Mary Stuart Masterson) who manages to somehow keep the station going with no scripts and people dying all around her. "Radioland Murders" has a crackerjack cast - besides the above, the cast includes Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Ned Beatty, Harvey Korman, George Burns, Scott Michael Campbell, Brion James, Anne DiSalvo - the list goes on. The radio shows (Lloyd's character is the sound effect man), the commercials and the music are absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately the director kept cutting from those elements to something else - either yelling or slapstick or both. The slapstick was incessant. Some slapstick is funny; constant slapstick becomes annoying. Certainly there are ways to show a chaotic, disorganized radio station without papers flying all over the place every two minutes and everyone getting knocked over and screaming. As far as the murders, they happen so quickly and so soon into the film that it was hard to know whom exactly had bought it. The acting is mostly good except for Benben, who for reasons of his own decided to pretend he was a wisecracking guy from the '40s instead of just doing the role. This is the same thing that ruined the "Nero Wolfe" show on A&E - you don't put an era on like a shoe, you ARE in the era, or you come off as being an external actor. Big disappointment. A shame because it had some great elements going for it.

    When this came out, the reviews were generally bad. But the idea intrigued me. So I tracked down the video and found that I liked it a lot. It's about a radio station where they are trying to change from a local station to a national network, with a romantic subplot, and the body count starts piling up too. It's kinda like "The Old Dark House" or "The Cat And The Canary", mystery comedies with a lot of things happening to a lot of characters in one night. Admittedly, it's uneven, and not all of the comedy works. It's frantic and zany, and the characters come and go and then come back again. Just when you've forgotten about one subplot, it pops back. Either that, or somebody new has turned up dead. So, if you are a little adventurous, I'd recommend that you give it a try.

    If you liked 1982's MY FAVORITE YEAR, you'll probably enjoy this silly romp into the world of radio, in the late 1930s when radio was king. A radio station run by "General" Ned Beatty is trying to establish itself as the fourth national network, but its efforts are being thwarted by an unseen killer who is knocking off station personnel in fairly rapid succession. Brian BenBen is the hero of this Woody Allen-ish piece, a writer for the station who becomes a suspect in the killings. Mary Stuart Masterson is a rising radio exec and BenBen's soon-to-be ex-wife. A ton of familiar faces dot the landscape, including good old George Burns, and if you know your character actors well enough, you'll quickly figure out the killer's identity. The film moves at a relatively frantic pace and veers toward the satirical, and you can figures out what popular radio performers of the time are being lovingly mocked, including Frank Sinatra, Cab Calloway and the Andrews or McGuire Sisters (I wasn't sure which). Michael McKean and orchestra do an uncanny Spike Jones imitation. The film does not have the brilliance of MY FAVORITE YEAR, however, and feels sort of empty despite all the junks going on.

    When this came out, the reviews were generally bad. But the idea intrigued me. So I tracked down the video and found that I liked it a lot. It's about a radio station where they are trying to change from a local station to a national network, with a romantic subplot, and the body count starts piling up too. It's kinda like "The Old Dark House" or "The Cat And The Canary", mystery comedies with a lot of things happening to a lot of characters in one night. Admittedly, it's uneven, and not all of the comedy works. It's frantic and zany, and the characters come and go and then come back again. Just when you've forgotten about one subplot, it pops back. Either that, or somebody new has turned up dead. So, if you are a little adventurous, I'd recommend that you give it a try.

    If you liked 1982's MY FAVORITE YEAR, you'll probably enjoy this silly romp into the world of radio, in the late 1930s when radio was king. A radio station run by "General" Ned Beatty is trying to establish itself as the fourth national network, but its efforts are being thwarted by an unseen killer who is knocking off station personnel in fairly rapid succession. Brian BenBen is the hero of this Woody Allen-ish piece, a writer for the station who becomes a suspect in the killings. Mary Stuart Masterson is a rising radio exec and BenBen's soon-to-be ex-wife. A ton of familiar faces dot the landscape, including good old George Burns, and if you know your character actors well enough, you'll quickly figure out the killer's identity. The film moves at a relatively frantic pace and veers toward the satirical, and you can figures out what popular radio performers of the time are being lovingly mocked, including Frank Sinatra, Cab Calloway and the Andrews or McGuire Sisters (I wasn't sure which). Michael McKean and orchestra do an uncanny Spike Jones imitation. The film does not have the brilliance of MY FAVORITE YEAR, however, and feels sort of empty despite all the junks going on.

    George Lucas' forgotten comedy-mystery is a masterful work for those who understand what it is. Radioland Murders is not a spoof or a parody of a 1930s comedy, as many people suppose. It is, literally, a 1930s comedy! Meaning, of course, that it is written as if it is a 1930s comedy, with physical gags and witty dialogue straight from the Golden Age of the 30s. Think about The Thin Man, or Abbott and Costello, or a Bert Lahr film, or You Can't Take It With You. If you love those films, you will love this movie. If you've never heard of those films, then you may find it hard to understand exactly what George Lucas was doing. Brian Benben and Mary Stuart Masterson head up an all-star cast in pure 1930s fashion, as people one by one begin to die off during the opening night of a new radio station. The antics are wholly 30s, with plenty of running into doors, falling out of chairs, and lots of humorous chatter that one might call "intelligent humor" (you have to be listening in order to find it funny). You won't be rolling on the floor in hysterics, because 1930s humor wasn't that sort of humor. You don't roar with laughter when you watch The Thin Man, but you chuckle at the clever dialogue and amusing antics of the characters, in a more refined way which characterized the manners of the era. As with all his movies such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones, George Lucas pays great homage to the Golden Age of cinema, and Radioland Murders is no exception. It is a fun, rollicking film, not for a mass audience, perhaps, but for those who enjoy the sophisticated humor from the 30s and 40s, a genre that is seldom, if ever, seen in comedy today.

    I remember watching this in the theater and it being so funny (for so long) that I couldn't breath I was laughing so much. Both my girlfriend and I had to look at the floor of the theater to look away from the screen to try and reduce our laughing because our sides hurt so much. Maybe if I watched it again I might not laugh quite so much but I remember laughing more at this movie than any other. And no, I wasn't a silly teenager at the time, I was in my 30's. I loved the fast, fast pace and the constant stream of jokes and sight gags. It does help if you can pay attention and keep track of everything that is going on. This is not a sophisticated comedy by any means, just a lot of good, clean fun (well, except for the murders). ;-) Just a (very) lot of fun.

    Going in, Radioland Murders has some key elements that could of made for an entertaining story: all-star cast in a screwball comedy and an nostalgic storyline that could put to use a colorful set. But it all failed. The joke delivery was flat and some of the casting choices were peculiar. Watching Mary Stuart Masterson struggle through the lead female role made me long for Jennifer Jason Leigh's brilliant, high-spirited, cigarette-chomping, Hepburn-inspired career girl in the Coens' Hudsucker Proxy. Also Brian Benben, most notable from HBO's "Dream On" series, doesn't give viewers any of maligned everyman he popularized in the older series. This movie attempts many times to emulate that 40s-era world, with its Art Deco imagery, but the characters come off more cartoonish than swashbuckling. There are far better period comedies, I suggest "My Favorite Year" starring Peter O'Toole; "Radio Days" by Woody Allen and the aforementioned Hudsucker just to name a few. Those films succeed where Radioland fails, pulling viewers into these bygone eras to feel an inkling of what those times felt and sounded like.

    The year was 1939 and America was in the flux of world wide change. Hitler was in Germany, Roosevelt was in the White House and a New Radio station was inaugurating it's first night on the air-waves. There are a hundred things which could go wrong and after watching this film for just a few minutes, the audience will indeed come to that conclusion. In the mist of growing chaos, personal problems also are thrown in the mix. Mr. Roger Henderson, (Brian Benben) in trying to win back his wife Penny (Mary Masterson) who threatens him with divorce. At the same time, the radio station employees are confronted with murder as several top executives are found dead. Several key characters add to the general mayhem such as General Whalen (Ned Beatty), Billy The Gopher, (Scott Campbell) Michael Lerner (Michael Cross) Zolttan (Christopher Lloyd) Herman Katsenback (Larry Miller), Billy Barty, Bobcat Goldthwait and Robert Walden. Director Mel Smith and writer George Lucas even threw in the Late George Burns. The station is flooded with everything from on stage Key-stone slap-stick, pratfalls, sight gags, verbal innuendos and hilarious vaudeville entertainment. The center of the story are the mysterious murders which are complex and interesting. All in all, the movie is wondrously exciting and musically entertaining. A fun visit to a far-away place where imagination of voice could transport you to anytime and place. Offered to anyone seeking a slice of radio memorabilia. ****

    I think the key to appreciating this movie is in your expectations. The first time I saw it I didn't like it that much but repeat viewings have made it one of my favorite comedies. It helps that I really like old timey radio shows, but that is not a prerequisite to enjoying the film. This movie moves fast, and I think that's one thing that throws a lot of people. Modern comedies tend to have a relaxed pace and an improvisational feel, but Radioland Murders keeps a break-neck, gag-a-minute pace. The jokes fly so fast you're liable to miss them. It almost moves too fast. For example, all the character relationships are laid out in the first five minutes before the main title even appears. If you blink you might fall behind. But if you can keep up the movie pays off in spades. The one complaint I do have is that the movie has so many talented actors it gives many of them very little to do. Some of the funniest (and most famous) actors die off before they get more than a few lines. But overall if you like machine-gun dialogue, screwball comedy, and lots of pratfalls, this is a hilarious movie.

    This movie takes us back 70 years ago at the City of Chicago, where station WBN hosts the variety of many radio programs. Unfortunately, it's also the place of interest where six murders are committed. Brian Benben stars as hapless writer Roger Henderson, who tries to solve the murders of stool-pigeon trumpet player Ruffles Reedy(Jack Sheldon), Toupee wearing Director Walt Whalen Jr.(Jeffery Tambor), Bossy Stage Manager Herman Katzenback(Larry Miller), Sleazy Radio Announcer Dexter Morris(Corbin Bernsen), humorless sponsor Bernie King(Brion James), and WBN Head Man General Walt Whalen(Ned Beatty). Accused of being the killer by Short-Tempered Lt. Cross(Michael Lerner), he, along with bell boy Billy(Scott M. Campbell) and his wife Penny Henderson(Mary S. Masterson), must find out who committed the murders and why. It features appearances by well-known comedian George Burns as the 100-year-experienced radio comedian Milt Lackey, Anita Morris' last appearance as the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl with the Va-Va-Va-Voom voice Claudette Katzenback, Christopher Lloyd as the sound effects man Zoltan, and Peter MacNicol(who is known for his starring role in the Mr. Bean Movie) as the son of one of the writers. To find out who the killer really is... You'll have to watch the movie. This movie is a nostalgia of classic radio and mystery with a dash of LOL. I guarantee you'll like this movie! 1000/1000

    The only thing that this inane film has going for it is its pacing. It is done lively and quiet fast and given the nature and how bad the film is, it's appropriate to do it that quickly. This is a definite take-off on the radio period in America. While a radio show goes on, the best part of the action seems to be on the backstage, where a series of murders are taking place, one after the other. Suspicion immediately falls on one of the writers who is on the verge of breaking up with his wife, the show's producer. The beginning showed progress with the problems of script writing presented. With the murders, the film falters quickly and becomes one of amateurish slapstick and all other mayhem and nonsense. The comedy lines are silly. One example is: Woman to man: "Don't you see the star on my dressing room?" His response was: "Does that mean you're Jewish?" Case closed.

    If you like the old radio shows, films set in the '30s and mysteries, this should be the film for you. The three things mentioned are favorite things of mine, but alas, I didn't enjoy this movie. The thin plot centers around a Phantom of the Radio (a disembodied voice) who says something sinister over a microphone, and then someone is murdered. Apparently all the people who are murdered worked together at another radio station that was involved in a scandal. One of the writers, Roger Henderson (Brian Benben becomes a suspect. He's the husband - possibly soon to be ex-husband of Penny Henderson (Mary Stuart Masterson) who manages to somehow keep the station going with no scripts and people dying all around her. "Radioland Murders" has a crackerjack cast - besides the above, the cast includes Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Ned Beatty, Harvey Korman, George Burns, Scott Michael Campbell, Brion James, Anne DiSalvo - the list goes on. The radio shows (Lloyd's character is the sound effect man), the commercials and the music are absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately the director kept cutting from those elements to something else - either yelling or slapstick or both. The slapstick was incessant. Some slapstick is funny; constant slapstick becomes annoying. Certainly there are ways to show a chaotic, disorganized radio station without papers flying all over the place every two minutes and everyone getting knocked over and screaming. As far as the murders, they happen so quickly and so soon into the film that it was hard to know whom exactly had bought it. The acting is mostly good except for Benben, who for reasons of his own decided to pretend he was a wisecracking guy from the '40s instead of just doing the role. This is the same thing that ruined the "Nero Wolfe" show on A&E - you don't put an era on like a shoe, you ARE in the era, or you come off as being an external actor. Big disappointment. A shame because it had some great elements going for it.

It's about a radio station where they are trying to change from a local station to a national network, with a romantic subplot, and the body count starts piling up too. It's kinda like "The Old Dark House" or "The Cat And The Canary", mystery comedies with a lot of things happening to a lot of characters in one night. Admittedly, it's uneven, and not all of the comedy works. It's frantic and zany, and the characters come and go and then come back again. Just when you've forgotten about one subplot, it pops back. Either that, or somebody new has turned up dead. So, if you are a little adventurous, I'd recommend that you give it a try.

    If you liked 1982's MY FAVORITE YEAR, you'll probably enjoy this silly romp into the world of radio, in the late 1930s when radio was king. A radio station run by "General" Ned Beatty is trying to establish itself as the fourth national network, but its efforts are being thwarted by an unseen killer who is knocking off station personnel in fairly rapid succession. Brian BenBen is the hero of this Woody Allen-ish piece, a writer for the station who becomes a suspect in the killings. Mary Stuart Masterson is a rising radio exec and BenBen's soon-to-be ex-wife. A ton of familiar faces dot the landscape, including good old George Burns, and if you know your character actors well enough, you'll quickly figure out the killer's identity. The film moves at a relatively frantic pace and veers toward the satirical, and you can figures out what popular radio performers of the time are being lovingly mocked, including Frank Sinatra, Cab Calloway and the Andrews or McGuire Sisters (I wasn't sure which). Michael McKean and orchestra do an uncanny Spike Jones imitation. The film does not have the brilliance of MY FAVORITE YEAR, however, and feels sort of empty despite all the junks going on.

    George Lucas' forgotten comedy-mystery is a masterful work for those who understand what it is. Radioland Murders is not a spoof or a parody of a 1930s comedy, as many people suppose. It is, literally, a 1930s comedy! Meaning, of course, that it is written as if it is a 1930s comedy, with physical gags and witty dialogue straight from the Golden Age of the 30s. Think about The Thin Man, or Abbott and Costello, or a Bert Lahr film, or You Can't Take It With You. If you love those films, you will love this movie. If you've never heard of those films, then you may find it hard to understand exactly what George Lucas was doing. Brian Benben and Mary Stuart Masterson head up an all-star cast in pure 1930s fashion, as people one by one begin to die off during the opening night of a new radio station. The antics are wholly 30s, with plenty of running into doors, falling out of chairs, and lots of humorous chatter that one might call "intelligent humor" (you have to be listening in order to find it funny). You won't be rolling on the floor in hysterics, because 1930s humor wasn't that sort of humor. You don't roar with laughter when you watch The Thin Man, but you chuckle at the clever dialogue and amusing antics of the characters, in a more refined way which characterized the manners of the era. As with all his movies such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones, George Lucas pays great homage to the Golden Age of cinema, and Radioland Murders is no exception. It is a fun, rollicking film, not for a mass audience, perhaps, but for those who enjoy the sophisticated humor from the 30s and 40s, a genre that is seldom, if ever, seen in comedy today.

    I remember watching this in the theater and it being so funny (for so long) that I couldn't breath I was laughing so much. Both my girlfriend and I had to look at the floor of the theater to look away from the screen to try and reduce our laughing because our sides hurt so much. Maybe if I watched it again I might not laugh quite so much but I remember laughing more at this movie than any other. And no, I wasn't a silly teenager at the time, I was in my 30's. I loved the fast, fast pace and the constant stream of jokes and sight gags. It does help if you can pay attention and keep track of everything that is going on. This is not a sophisticated comedy by any means, just a lot of good, clean fun (well, except for the murders). ;-) Just a (very) lot of fun.

    Going in, Radioland Murders has some key elements that could of made for an entertaining story: all-star cast in a screwball comedy and an nostalgic storyline that could put to use a colorful set. But it all failed. The joke delivery was flat and some of the casting choices were peculiar. Watching Mary Stuart Masterson struggle through the lead female role made me long for Jennifer Jason Leigh's brilliant, high-spirited, cigarette-chomping, Hepburn-inspired career girl in the Coens' Hudsucker Proxy. Also Brian Benben, most notable from HBO's "Dream On" series, doesn't give viewers any of maligned everyman he popularized in the older series. This movie attempts many times to emulate that 40s-era world, with its Art Deco imagery, but the characters come off more cartoonish than swashbuckling. There are far better period comedies, I suggest "My Favorite Year" starring Peter O'Toole; "Radio Days" by Woody Allen and the aforementioned Hudsucker just to name a few. Those films succeed where Radioland fails, pulling viewers into these bygone eras to feel an inkling of what those times felt and sounded like.

    The year was 1939 and America was in the flux of world wide change. Hitler was in Germany, Roosevelt was in the White House and a New Radio station was inaugurating it's first night on the air-waves. There are a hundred things which could go wrong and after watching this film for just a few minutes, the audience will indeed come to that conclusion. In the mist of growing chaos, personal problems also are thrown in the mix. Mr. Roger Henderson, (Brian Benben) in trying to win back his wife Penny (Mary Masterson) who threatens him with divorce. At the same time, the radio station employees are confronted with murder as several top executives are found dead. Several key characters add to the general mayhem such as General Whalen (Ned Beatty), Billy The Gopher, (Scott Campbell) Michael Lerner (Michael Cross) Zolttan (Christopher Lloyd) Herman Katsenback (Larry Miller), Billy Barty, Bobcat Goldthwait and Robert Walden. Director Mel Smith and writer George Lucas even threw in the Late George Burns. The station is flooded with everything from on stage Key-stone slap-stick, pratfalls, sight gags, verbal innuendos and hilarious vaudeville entertainment. The center of the story are the mysterious murders which are complex and interesting. All in all, the movie is wondrously exciting and musically entertaining. A fun visit to a far-away place where imagination of voice could transport you to anytime and place. Offered to anyone seeking a slice of radio memorabilia. ****

    I think the key to appreciating this movie is in your expectations. The first time I saw it I didn't like it that much but repeat viewings have made it one of my favorite comedies. It helps that I really like old timey radio shows, but that is not a prerequisite to enjoying the film. This movie moves fast, and I think that's one thing that throws a lot of people. Modern comedies tend to have a relaxed pace and an improvisational feel, but Radioland Murders keeps a break-neck, gag-a-minute pace. The jokes fly so fast you're liable to miss them. It almost moves too fast. For example, all the character relationships are laid out in the first five minutes before the main title even appears. If you blink you might fall behind. But if you can keep up the movie pays off in spades. The one complaint I do have is that the movie has so many talented actors it gives many of them very little to do. Some of the funniest (and most famous) actors die off before they get more than a few lines. But overall if you like machine-gun dialogue, screwball comedy, and lots of pratfalls, this is a hilarious movie.

    This movie takes us back 70 years ago at the City of Chicago, where station WBN hosts the variety of many radio programs. Unfortunately, it's also the place of interest where six murders are committed. Brian Benben stars as hapless writer Roger Henderson, who tries to solve the murders of stool-pigeon trumpet player Ruffles Reedy(Jack Sheldon), Toupee wearing Director Walt Whalen Jr.(Jeffery Tambor), Bossy Stage Manager Herman Katzenback(Larry Miller), Sleazy Radio Announcer Dexter Morris(Corbin Bernsen), humorless sponsor Bernie King(Brion James), and WBN Head Man General Walt Whalen(Ned Beatty). Accused of being the killer by Short-Tempered Lt. Cross(Michael Lerner), he, along with bell boy Billy(Scott M. Campbell) and his wife Penny Henderson(Mary S. Masterson), must find out who committed the murders and why. It features appearances by well-known comedian George Burns as the 100-year-experienced radio comedian Milt Lackey, Anita Morris' last appearance as the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl with the Va-Va-Va-Voom voice Claudette Katzenback, Christopher Lloyd as the sound effects man Zoltan, and Peter MacNicol(who is known for his starring role in the Mr. Bean Movie) as the son of one of the writers. To find out who the killer really is... You'll have to watch the movie. This movie is a nostalgia of classic radio and mystery with a dash of LOL. I guarantee you'll like this movie! 1000/1000

    The only thing that this inane film has going for it is its pacing. It is done lively and quiet fast and given the nature and how bad the film is, it's appropriate to do it that quickly. This is a definite take-off on the radio period in America. While a radio show goes on, the best part of the action seems to be on the backstage, where a series of murders are taking place, one after the other. Suspicion immediately falls on one of the writers who is on the verge of breaking up with his wife, the show's producer. The beginning showed progress with the problems of script writing presented. With the murders, the film falters quickly and becomes one of amateurish slapstick and all other mayhem and nonsense. The comedy lines are silly. One example is: Woman to man: "Don't you see the star on my dressing room?" His response was: "Does that mean you're Jewish?" Case closed.

    If you like the old radio shows, films set in the '30s and mysteries, this should be the film for you. The three things mentioned are favorite things of mine, but alas, I didn't enjoy this movie. The thin plot centers around a Phantom of the Radio (a disembodied voice) who says something sinister over a microphone, and then someone is murdered. Apparently all the people who are murdered worked together at another radio station that was involved in a scandal. One of the writers, Roger Henderson (Brian Benben becomes a suspect. He's the husband - possibly soon to be ex-husband of Penny Henderson (Mary Stuart Masterson) who manages to somehow keep the station going with no scripts and people dying all around her. "Radioland Murders" has a crackerjack cast - besides the above, the cast includes Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Ned Beatty, Harvey Korman, George Burns, Scott Michael Campbell, Brion James, Anne DiSalvo - the list goes on. The radio shows (Lloyd's character is the sound effect man), the commercials and the music are absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately the director kept cutting from those elements to something else - either yelling or slapstick or both. The slapstick was incessant. Some slapstick is funny; constant slapstick becomes annoying. Certainly there are ways to show a chaotic, disorganized radio station without papers flying all over the place every two minutes and everyone getting knocked over and screaming. As far as the murders, they happen so quickly and so soon into the film that it was hard to know whom exactly had bought it. The acting is mostly good except for Benben, who for reasons of his own decided to pretend he was a wisecracking guy from the '40s instead of just doing the role. This is the same thing that ruined the "Nero Wolfe" show on A&E - you don't put an era on like a shoe, you ARE in the era, or you come off as being an external actor. Big disappointment. A shame because it had some great elements going for it.
