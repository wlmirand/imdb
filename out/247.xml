    Okay, so I know that the Power Rangers: Turbo series is one of if not the most hated season in the Power Rangers universe, even among Power Rangers fans. I know that I've read a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I don't think that it's bad. I find it to be quite good and entertaining. It is a good setup up for a series and makes you want to see more of it. But I also get the feeling that there is not enough in it. A lot of good scenes were rumored to be cut. I will not go into detail about that here in this review since I don't want this to have any spoilers. I just hope that all these good scenes were filmed and will pop up in a future release someday. I don't know all the people who hate this movie. I will tell you right now, if you aren't a Power Rangers fan, there is no reason to watch this movie and no reason to flood this site with bad reviews because if it. But I like this movie and I recommend it for Power Rangers fan. It isn't as bad as some people think and I figure you might enjoy it to, provided you liked the classic seasons.

    I was shocked,surprised and horrified by the negative reviews and the low ratings I would see on the web, i don't know why anyone hates that movie and why is it called the worst movie ever? I thought this film was a very good power rangers movie it was one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life Not worse than Disaster movie but the 1st Power rangers Movie (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie) was pretty good the Zords are great the acting is awesome the plot makes sense Jason and Kimberley are in it but Too bad That Billy and Trini and Zack are not in it the best part in the turbo movie was the part when the 4 rangers got the turbo powers the funniest part of this movie is an amusing cameo from Rita and Lord Zedd. and it was a great film all the kids and Power Rangers fans enjoyed it, including myself, Turbo a Power Rangers Movie was a Big first Episode before Power Rangers Turbo and it's the best power rangers movie It's not bad as the people that give it a 1 I say. Trust me, this is not a 1 star movie, Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2 and Son of the Mask and Disaster Movie are 1 star movies. if you never watch Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie then Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is what you want it's not the worst movie ever, It's a must see for any Power Ranger fan! and fun For the whole family

    I love Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie, some good clean fun, but this movie is just embarrassing, and nowhere near as fun. The plot centres around an extraterrestrial wizard named Lerigot, who goes to Earth in order to avoid capture by a crazed alien queen, Divatox (no, seriously). She plans to use Lerigot to open up a portal so that she can marry an evil dark creature, Maligore, and unite their powers. Naturally, the Power Rangers must stop this. Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is nowhere near as much fun or cool to watch as the first movie. Most notably, Aisha and Billy are completely missing, with no explanation, and Kimberly is no longer a Power Ranger either for some reason, even though she has an important part in the film, thankfully, along with old regular Jason. Rocky is technically there, but he suffers an injury at the start of the film, as if trying to get him out of it, which is sad. Then we have a new blue ranger, Justin, who really is much too young to be a Ranger. A more serious problem is the Zords. The whole mythology around the Power Rangers is much lamer here. The Zords are no longer kinds of animals, they are now all cars, called "Turbo" powers, which just feels nowhere near as imaginative. At a pivotal point of the film, the car Zords merge into what I find hard to describe as anything but a Transformers rip-off. Even worse than that, though, is the fact that the Power Rangers, in Power Ranger form, have so little screen time. Furthermore, the plot is terribly paced, and not very fun to follow. The Rangers have to travel to another dimension via an old pirate ship. Seriously? In the first half hour, a lot of time is wasted with the Rangers trying to find Lerigot, and some insufferable scenes of him wandering around the jungle. Nothing hangs together at all. Remember how central the very concept of being a Power Ranger was to the first movie? Here, it feels like little more than a gimmick. Lerigot is a body-sized puppet who looks like an extra from The Dark Crystal. With his wide doe eyes and nonsensical slurring, he gets on your nerves very quickly, and he just does not stop. The rest of the supporting cast is just as bad. Divatox's henchmen are just laughably embarrassing, especially the insufferable Elgar. Remember Goldar, and Mordant? Those were entertaining henchmen. Maligore, for a supposed unstoppable force of evil, is incredibly ungainly and ineffective. Divatox herself is amusing and Hilary Shephard Turner clearly has a lot of fun with the role, but her overacting gets a little over the top. All the puns are so self-conscious as if the writer were self-aware how bad it would turn out. The special effects are much poorer than in the first movie, too, especially Zordon (he barely looks like he's talking) and Maligore's crater (amateur bluescreen mistake there). Thank goodness Alpha is as good as ever. The best part of the movie is an amusing cameo from Rita and Lord Zedd. That's about a minute in length, and it made the movie for me. Too bad that the rest isn't as fun to watch. Not even having Kimberly and Jason there can help, really. There's none of the spirit of adventure from the first movie. Do yourself a favour and pass this one up, you're not really missing anything. Watch Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers instead.

    As a kid my older brother liked power rangers a lot. The original show, was very similar to the Batman show in the 60s. It was cheesy, silly but in all very entertaining for its camp value. The movie was okay, but with its clich&eacute;s and dumb pointless moments kind of killed it. In 1997 a kind of sequel came out and it's as exiting as...watching the grass grow. There was only 25 minutes of time where you see the power rangers. 25 MINUTES!!! The plot (or at least as much plot as I could find in this) is that some lady named Devatox is hunting down a wizard, Laragou, who looks like an ewok with the face of Dr. Zaius from planet of the apes, to of course, take over the world. The power rangers have no choice but to intervene. I should also mention that about five minutes of the time the power rangers are in there costumes there looking for the bad guys lair. I mean WOW... I mean why is even called Power Rangers? Why not "KIDS WHO FIGHT BAD GUYS AND WEAR THE SAME COLORS EVERYDAY", at least that would make sense! SPOILER: The final battle looks like crap. Somehow, they made the megazord look MORE like multi-colored cardboard boxes... In all the movie sucks, and is a big disappointment to anyone who loved Power Rangers like I did.

    My experience with this horrible waste of celluloid was bringing my 3, 6 and 9 year old, all Power Ranger fans, to this stinker. Although enraptured by the first movie, none of them could sit still for this one and ended up rolling in the aisles rather than watching it. This movie does everything wrong:... Talking vs Action: The worst thing you can do with a movie is to put in too much dialogue and this has WAY too much in spades - ESPECIALLY for a child's movie! Most of the movie is nothing more than actors walking around sets explaining plot details with absolutely no action until 50 minutes into the movie! 50 minutes of talking and explanation in a child's movie?!?! Really? Who wrote this?! Not only that, the Power Rangers don't actually get involved in any action until 1 hour and 10 minutes into the film!!.... Sex over Budget: It's a common B-Movie mantra that when you don't have money for location shoots, special effects or name actors - let loose the cheesecake! I can understand following this maxim in a slasher flick or teen comedy but a child's movie?! The main 'villainess' is clad in full dominatrix gear showing plenty of ample cleavage, thighs, legs and even her navel as the costume has a line going down her stomach. Much of the movie she poses and mugs at the camera while giving commands - fine for a regular B-Movie... but Power Rangers?! There are numerous close-ups and elevator shots of the female cast members including an elevator-to close up shot of the blond power ranger ending at her bust and another fade-in to close-up of Kimberly's butt as she lays face down on the island. My nine year old actually made a comment that Kim's butt was basically the whole screen. I'm no prude but WHO is this movie written for? What does this make up for? No action and an ending where the Power Rangers fight a guy in a rubber suit!? Summary: This is the perfect example of a movie put together by a director who had absolutely no idea what he was doing. This is bad as a kid's movie and bad as an adult movie - it's just plain bad!

    Power Rangers Turbo: The Television Series is better than Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie! Yes, it should be the other way around, movies are meant to be better than TV, but they got it very wrong here! The series was filled with Elgar the comical mutant dropping jokes all the time but I can't even remember if Elgar is even in the movie! Adding to this, I don't like that short stupid looking creature that appears in this film. About the only pleasing part of the film was interesting footage of the submarine and that just comes from my liking of submarines. The first Power Rangers movie was a lot better than this and it is not too hard to understand why Turbo was the last PR movie!

    The Power Rangers must journey towards an island that houses the evil Malagore, in order to stop Divatox from unleashing the creature of pure destruction...In my opinion the film was fine but what followed was the end of the entire series in my opinion...The film had a good cast, brining back characters like Jason and Kimberly...But what really annoyed me was the addition of Justin the kid Ranger!!! This wasn't like the previous movie, with new versions of armoury..it was just a very long episode...The end fight scene was satisfactory but after waiting throughout the whole film for an amazing fight scene it is kind of disappointing to only witness 3-4 minutes worth of action....It was entertaining nonetheless...

    I was eleven years old when this second Power Rangers movie came out. I know some fans had gone off the Rangers by the time they were that age, but I didn't mature as fast as them. So, I was still a big fan when this film came out (I was even still a big fan a year later), and remember watching it over and over for a while. Now, believe me, if I didn't see it then, I would NOT have bothered watching it ten years later, but because of the wonderful memories, I decided to do so. Obviously, it wasn't the same. Divatox, an evil alien pirate, plans to go to the island of Muranthias on Earth, where she intends to release an evil creature named Maligore and marry him. In order to do this, she will need Lerigot, a good wizard, so she plans to have him kidnapped! Fortunately, the wizard manages to escape to Earth, seeking help. Tommy and Katherine go to find him in Africa, and teleport him back to the command centre. However, Lerigot soon decides to surrender after it is learned that Divatox has captured his wife and child! After this, the evil space pirate and her crew head toward the island, and it's obviously up to the Power Rangers to try and stop her, but before they set out, Zordon and Alpha 5 give them new powers called "Turbo powers"! Where do I start in describing this movie? Well, first of all, there are some pretty poor quality characters. I would say the worst is probably Divatox, who was the Rangers' main enemy in the "Power Rangers Turbo" series. She basically acts like a bratty kid, and it seems her antics are supposed to be funny, but at an adult's perspective, they're quite embarrassing. Hilary Shepard puts on a VERY poor performance in this role! Nobody in the cast is very impressive, but most of them do a better job than her! Another character who brings the movie down in quality a bit is Justin, the new Blue Ranger, who is a lot younger than the rest. He's certainly not the only character with lame lines, but it seems his are often worse than most of the others. None of the characters stand out as really good, but clearly, some do stand out as remarkably bad. As you can probably tell from the above paragraph, this movie has a poor script, and the acting generally isn't so good. If you're an adult who is at all familiar with Power Rangers, I'm sure none of this surprises you. Now, sometimes when a movie is bad, it can be unintentionally funny. A few months ago, I watched "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" (which I had never seen before), and around the beginning, I found that it was mildly amusing, but was disappointed to find that the amusement soon went away. Watching this movie after that one, I was hoping for some more unintentional humour, but didn't really find any of that, apart from the scene where the Power Rangers have just gotten their new Turbo powers, and say things like "This is great!" (with a thumbs up) and "This is awesome!" As a straight male, there's one thing I got out of this movie that I wouldn't have when I was eleven, which was the looks/physique of certain female actors, including Nakia Burrise and Catherine Sutherland who play Tanya and Katherine (the two female Rangers of the time), and I guess even Hilary Shepard who plays the dreadful main villain, but this obviously didn't make the entire film for me. Now, I must admit that watching "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" again after all these years wasn't quite the same as watching "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" for the first time earlier this year. It didn't seem QUITE as bad, even though it's generally considered inferior to its predecessor. In fact, call me crazy, but I found that some parts weren't too bad at all, though I wouldn't say I exactly enjoyed the movie. However, I guess the fact that I actually saw it in my childhood is a major part of this, and if I just watched it for the first time, it probably would have been very similar to the experience I had with its predecessor, watching it for the first time way too late. For those who saw this movie in their childhood and are now adults, if you're curious to see what you would think of it now, I wouldn't say that's a bad idea, but not a very good one, either. For everyone else beyond their childhood, I think you know to just stay away. I may look like a fool watching "Turbo" at my age and then writing a long, negative review (after all, it is a kids' movie), but like I said, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't seen it at a much earlier age.

    I was a fan of the series even into '97. This movie made absolutely no sense. When I was 9, I thought it was cool to have a kid be a Power Panger...now I look back on it and cringe...they must've been desperate to keep people interested. And I do believe that we've already had a classic animated series in the '80s featuring cars turning into giant robots and it has a hit movie out now with Shia LaBeouf (Shia, if I spelled your name wrong, I'm sorry) called...I don't know...(cough)TRANS-(cough)-FORMERS(cough)! Bottom line, this movie would have a tough time surpassing Jaws 4...there I said it, as ashamed as I am to say it. (aside: I use Jaws 4 as a comparison to other films that are worse than bad to try and give an idea of how bad a film really is).

    Saw it once at 9-10 years old did not care for it although I was syked when I heard Jason (Austin St. John) the original Red Ranger and the greatest ranger of all time period! Saw it again yesterday and same thing did not care for it. It looks like the TV show the effects which for a movie of this supposed magnitude should have rocked the house with the then new improved CGI instead looked like LASER FLOYD anyone remember that one neither do I. The plot is really thin and the spoilers are given away almost immediately with the trailers and interviews the only part with the Turbo Megazord was too short 5 mins and face it if there was no zords the show would not have lasted as long as it did or less than that MMPR: the movie's Ninja Megazord had at least 15-20 mins of screen time and had impressive CGI at least at that time it did. The major baddie Mali...something was not threatening at all MMPR had more impressive monsters than this rubberized reject but I give it a four because of a hinted romance between Jason and Kimberly I mean who goes out with a girl solo and still be just friends plus they acted a little too friendly around each other flirting and whatnot and were hardly seen without each other and only fraternizing with each other if that doesn't say love I don't know what does. Even though we get the big three of power rangers I mean everyone knows these guys Jason (the compassionate leader) Kimberly (The heart of the team and she's pretty damn hot) and Tommy (the favorite and pretty boy of the group) the character development well face it there was none plummets this from movie to one overlong action kiddie show. I also give it a four because out goes Rocky Jason's replacement and the most annoying of the original MMMPR and then Blue Zeo Ranger YES!!!!! and enter Justin the other immensely annoying Blue Ranger NOOOOOO!!!!! All in all the return of Jason and Kimberly couldn't save this one from the pointless action sequences thin plot and annoying character of Justin it was better off with a direct to video release even Die Hard fans may want to steer clear of this one

Although enraptured by the first movie, none of them could sit still for this one and ended up rolling in the aisles rather than watching it. This movie does everything wrong:... Talking vs Action: The worst thing you can do with a movie is to put in too much dialogue and this has WAY too much in spades - ESPECIALLY for a child's movie! Most of the movie is nothing more than actors walking around sets explaining plot details with absolutely no action until 50 minutes into the movie! 50 minutes of talking and explanation in a child's movie?!?! Really? Who wrote this?! Not only that, the Power Rangers don't actually get involved in any action until 1 hour and 10 minutes into the film!!.... Sex over Budget: It's a common B-Movie mantra that when you don't have money for location shoots, special effects or name actors - let loose the cheesecake! I can understand following this maxim in a slasher flick or teen comedy but a child's movie?! The main 'villainess' is clad in full dominatrix gear showing plenty of ample cleavage, thighs, legs and even her navel as the costume has a line going down her stomach. Much of the movie she poses and mugs at the camera while giving commands - fine for a regular B-Movie... but Power Rangers?! There are numerous close-ups and elevator shots of the female cast members including an elevator-to close up shot of the blond power ranger ending at her bust and another fade-in to close-up of Kimberly's butt as she lays face down on the island. My nine year old actually made a comment that Kim's butt was basically the whole screen. I'm no prude but WHO is this movie written for? What does this make up for? No action and an ending where the Power Rangers fight a guy in a rubber suit!? Summary: This is the perfect example of a movie put together by a director who had absolutely no idea what he was doing. This is bad as a kid's movie and bad as an adult movie - it's just plain bad!

    Power Rangers Turbo: The Television Series is better than Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie! Yes, it should be the other way around, movies are meant to be better than TV, but they got it very wrong here! The series was filled with Elgar the comical mutant dropping jokes all the time but I can't even remember if Elgar is even in the movie! Adding to this, I don't like that short stupid looking creature that appears in this film. About the only pleasing part of the film was interesting footage of the submarine and that just comes from my liking of submarines. The first Power Rangers movie was a lot better than this and it is not too hard to understand why Turbo was the last PR movie!

    The Power Rangers must journey towards an island that houses the evil Malagore, in order to stop Divatox from unleashing the creature of pure destruction...In my opinion the film was fine but what followed was the end of the entire series in my opinion...The film had a good cast, brining back characters like Jason and Kimberly...But what really annoyed me was the addition of Justin the kid Ranger!!! This wasn't like the previous movie, with new versions of armoury..it was just a very long episode...The end fight scene was satisfactory but after waiting throughout the whole film for an amazing fight scene it is kind of disappointing to only witness 3-4 minutes worth of action....It was entertaining nonetheless...

    I was eleven years old when this second Power Rangers movie came out. I know some fans had gone off the Rangers by the time they were that age, but I didn't mature as fast as them. So, I was still a big fan when this film came out (I was even still a big fan a year later), and remember watching it over and over for a while. Now, believe me, if I didn't see it then, I would NOT have bothered watching it ten years later, but because of the wonderful memories, I decided to do so. Obviously, it wasn't the same. Divatox, an evil alien pirate, plans to go to the island of Muranthias on Earth, where she intends to release an evil creature named Maligore and marry him. In order to do this, she will need Lerigot, a good wizard, so she plans to have him kidnapped! Fortunately, the wizard manages to escape to Earth, seeking help. Tommy and Katherine go to find him in Africa, and teleport him back to the command centre. However, Lerigot soon decides to surrender after it is learned that Divatox has captured his wife and child! After this, the evil space pirate and her crew head toward the island, and it's obviously up to the Power Rangers to try and stop her, but before they set out, Zordon and Alpha 5 give them new powers called "Turbo powers"! Where do I start in describing this movie? Well, first of all, there are some pretty poor quality characters. I would say the worst is probably Divatox, who was the Rangers' main enemy in the "Power Rangers Turbo" series. She basically acts like a bratty kid, and it seems her antics are supposed to be funny, but at an adult's perspective, they're quite embarrassing. Hilary Shepard puts on a VERY poor performance in this role! Nobody in the cast is very impressive, but most of them do a better job than her! Another character who brings the movie down in quality a bit is Justin, the new Blue Ranger, who is a lot younger than the rest. He's certainly not the only character with lame lines, but it seems his are often worse than most of the others. None of the characters stand out as really good, but clearly, some do stand out as remarkably bad. As you can probably tell from the above paragraph, this movie has a poor script, and the acting generally isn't so good. If you're an adult who is at all familiar with Power Rangers, I'm sure none of this surprises you. Now, sometimes when a movie is bad, it can be unintentionally funny. A few months ago, I watched "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" (which I had never seen before), and around the beginning, I found that it was mildly amusing, but was disappointed to find that the amusement soon went away. Watching this movie after that one, I was hoping for some more unintentional humour, but didn't really find any of that, apart from the scene where the Power Rangers have just gotten their new Turbo powers, and say things like "This is great!" (with a thumbs up) and "This is awesome!" As a straight male, there's one thing I got out of this movie that I wouldn't have when I was eleven, which was the looks/physique of certain female actors, including Nakia Burrise and Catherine Sutherland who play Tanya and Katherine (the two female Rangers of the time), and I guess even Hilary Shepard who plays the dreadful main villain, but this obviously didn't make the entire film for me. Now, I must admit that watching "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" again after all these years wasn't quite the same as watching "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" for the first time earlier this year. It didn't seem QUITE as bad, even though it's generally considered inferior to its predecessor. In fact, call me crazy, but I found that some parts weren't too bad at all, though I wouldn't say I exactly enjoyed the movie. However, I guess the fact that I actually saw it in my childhood is a major part of this, and if I just watched it for the first time, it probably would have been very similar to the experience I had with its predecessor, watching it for the first time way too late. For those who saw this movie in their childhood and are now adults, if you're curious to see what you would think of it now, I wouldn't say that's a bad idea, but not a very good one, either. For everyone else beyond their childhood, I think you know to just stay away. I may look like a fool watching "Turbo" at my age and then writing a long, negative review (after all, it is a kids' movie), but like I said, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't seen it at a much earlier age.

    I was a fan of the series even into '97. This movie made absolutely no sense. When I was 9, I thought it was cool to have a kid be a Power Panger...now I look back on it and cringe...they must've been desperate to keep people interested. And I do believe that we've already had a classic animated series in the '80s featuring cars turning into giant robots and it has a hit movie out now with Shia LaBeouf (Shia, if I spelled your name wrong, I'm sorry) called...I don't know...(cough)TRANS-(cough)-FORMERS(cough)! Bottom line, this movie would have a tough time surpassing Jaws 4...there I said it, as ashamed as I am to say it. (aside: I use Jaws 4 as a comparison to other films that are worse than bad to try and give an idea of how bad a film really is).

    Saw it once at 9-10 years old did not care for it although I was syked when I heard Jason (Austin St. John) the original Red Ranger and the greatest ranger of all time period! Saw it again yesterday and same thing did not care for it. It looks like the TV show the effects which for a movie of this supposed magnitude should have rocked the house with the then new improved CGI instead looked like LASER FLOYD anyone remember that one neither do I. The plot is really thin and the spoilers are given away almost immediately with the trailers and interviews the only part with the Turbo Megazord was too short 5 mins and face it if there was no zords the show would not have lasted as long as it did or less than that MMPR: the movie's Ninja Megazord had at least 15-20 mins of screen time and had impressive CGI at least at that time it did. The major baddie Mali...something was not threatening at all MMPR had more impressive monsters than this rubberized reject but I give it a four because of a hinted romance between Jason and Kimberly I mean who goes out with a girl solo and still be just friends plus they acted a little too friendly around each other flirting and whatnot and were hardly seen without each other and only fraternizing with each other if that doesn't say love I don't know what does. Even though we get the big three of power rangers I mean everyone knows these guys Jason (the compassionate leader) Kimberly (The heart of the team and she's pretty damn hot) and Tommy (the favorite and pretty boy of the group) the character development well face it there was none plummets this from movie to one overlong action kiddie show. I also give it a four because out goes Rocky Jason's replacement and the most annoying of the original MMMPR and then Blue Zeo Ranger YES!!!!! and enter Justin the other immensely annoying Blue Ranger NOOOOOO!!!!! All in all the return of Jason and Kimberly couldn't save this one from the pointless action sequences thin plot and annoying character of Justin it was better off with a direct to video release even Die Hard fans may want to steer clear of this one

    Okay, so I know that the Power Rangers: Turbo series is one of if not the most hated season in the Power Rangers universe, even among Power Rangers fans. I know that I've read a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I don't think that it's bad. I find it to be quite good and entertaining. It is a good setup up for a series and makes you want to see more of it. But I also get the feeling that there is not enough in it. A lot of good scenes were rumored to be cut. I will not go into detail about that here in this review since I don't want this to have any spoilers. I just hope that all these good scenes were filmed and will pop up in a future release someday. I don't know all the people who hate this movie. I will tell you right now, if you aren't a Power Rangers fan, there is no reason to watch this movie and no reason to flood this site with bad reviews because if it. But I like this movie and I recommend it for Power Rangers fan. It isn't as bad as some people think and I figure you might enjoy it to, provided you liked the classic seasons.

    I was shocked,surprised and horrified by the negative reviews and the low ratings I would see on the web, i don't know why anyone hates that movie and why is it called the worst movie ever? I thought this film was a very good power rangers movie it was one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life Not worse than Disaster movie but the 1st Power rangers Movie (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie) was pretty good the Zords are great the acting is awesome the plot makes sense Jason and Kimberley are in it but Too bad That Billy and Trini and Zack are not in it the best part in the turbo movie was the part when the 4 rangers got the turbo powers the funniest part of this movie is an amusing cameo from Rita and Lord Zedd. and it was a great film all the kids and Power Rangers fans enjoyed it, including myself, Turbo a Power Rangers Movie was a Big first Episode before Power Rangers Turbo and it's the best power rangers movie It's not bad as the people that give it a 1 I say. Trust me, this is not a 1 star movie, Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2 and Son of the Mask and Disaster Movie are 1 star movies. if you never watch Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie then Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is what you want it's not the worst movie ever, It's a must see for any Power Ranger fan! and fun For the whole family

    I love Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie, some good clean fun, but this movie is just embarrassing, and nowhere near as fun. The plot centres around an extraterrestrial wizard named Lerigot, who goes to Earth in order to avoid capture by a crazed alien queen, Divatox (no, seriously). She plans to use Lerigot to open up a portal so that she can marry an evil dark creature, Maligore, and unite their powers. Naturally, the Power Rangers must stop this. Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is nowhere near as much fun or cool to watch as the first movie. Most notably, Aisha and Billy are completely missing, with no explanation, and Kimberly is no longer a Power Ranger either for some reason, even though she has an important part in the film, thankfully, along with old regular Jason. Rocky is technically there, but he suffers an injury at the start of the film, as if trying to get him out of it, which is sad. Then we have a new blue ranger, Justin, who really is much too young to be a Ranger. A more serious problem is the Zords. The whole mythology around the Power Rangers is much lamer here. The Zords are no longer kinds of animals, they are now all cars, called "Turbo" powers, which just feels nowhere near as imaginative. At a pivotal point of the film, the car Zords merge into what I find hard to describe as anything but a Transformers rip-off. Even worse than that, though, is the fact that the Power Rangers, in Power Ranger form, have so little screen time. Furthermore, the plot is terribly paced, and not very fun to follow. The Rangers have to travel to another dimension via an old pirate ship. Seriously? In the first half hour, a lot of time is wasted with the Rangers trying to find Lerigot, and some insufferable scenes of him wandering around the jungle. Nothing hangs together at all. Remember how central the very concept of being a Power Ranger was to the first movie? Here, it feels like little more than a gimmick. Lerigot is a body-sized puppet who looks like an extra from The Dark Crystal. With his wide doe eyes and nonsensical slurring, he gets on your nerves very quickly, and he just does not stop. The rest of the supporting cast is just as bad. Divatox's henchmen are just laughably embarrassing, especially the insufferable Elgar. Remember Goldar, and Mordant? Those were entertaining henchmen. Maligore, for a supposed unstoppable force of evil, is incredibly ungainly and ineffective. Divatox herself is amusing and Hilary Shephard Turner clearly has a lot of fun with the role, but her overacting gets a little over the top. All the puns are so self-conscious as if the writer were self-aware how bad it would turn out. The special effects are much poorer than in the first movie, too, especially Zordon (he barely looks like he's talking) and Maligore's crater (amateur bluescreen mistake there). Thank goodness Alpha is as good as ever. The best part of the movie is an amusing cameo from Rita and Lord Zedd. That's about a minute in length, and it made the movie for me. Too bad that the rest isn't as fun to watch. Not even having Kimberly and Jason there can help, really. There's none of the spirit of adventure from the first movie. Do yourself a favour and pass this one up, you're not really missing anything. Watch Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers instead.

    As a kid my older brother liked power rangers a lot. The original show, was very similar to the Batman show in the 60s. It was cheesy, silly but in all very entertaining for its camp value. The movie was okay, but with its clich&eacute;s and dumb pointless moments kind of killed it. In 1997 a kind of sequel came out and it's as exiting as...watching the grass grow. There was only 25 minutes of time where you see the power rangers. 25 MINUTES!!! The plot (or at least as much plot as I could find in this) is that some lady named Devatox is hunting down a wizard, Laragou, who looks like an ewok with the face of Dr. Zaius from planet of the apes, to of course, take over the world. The power rangers have no choice but to intervene. I should also mention that about five minutes of the time the power rangers are in there costumes there looking for the bad guys lair. I mean WOW... I mean why is even called Power Rangers? Why not "KIDS WHO FIGHT BAD GUYS AND WEAR THE SAME COLORS EVERYDAY", at least that would make sense! SPOILER: The final battle looks like crap. Somehow, they made the megazord look MORE like multi-colored cardboard boxes... In all the movie sucks, and is a big disappointment to anyone who loved Power Rangers like I did.

The major baddie Mali...something was not threatening at all MMPR had more impressive monsters than this rubberized reject but I give it a four because of a hinted romance between Jason and Kimberly I mean who goes out with a girl solo and still be just friends plus they acted a little too friendly around each other flirting and whatnot and were hardly seen without each other and only fraternizing with each other if that doesn't say love I don't know what does. Even though we get the big three of power rangers I mean everyone knows these guys Jason (the compassionate leader) Kimberly (The heart of the team and she's pretty damn hot) and Tommy (the favorite and pretty boy of the group) the character development well face it there was none plummets this from movie to one overlong action kiddie show. I also give it a four because out goes Rocky Jason's replacement and the most annoying of the original MMMPR and then Blue Zeo Ranger YES!!!!! and enter Justin the other immensely annoying Blue Ranger NOOOOOO!!!!! All in all the return of Jason and Kimberly couldn't save this one from the pointless action sequences thin plot and annoying character of Justin it was better off with a direct to video release even Die Hard fans may want to steer clear of this one

    Okay, so I know that the Power Rangers: Turbo series is one of if not the most hated season in the Power Rangers universe, even among Power Rangers fans. I know that I've read a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I don't think that it's bad. I find it to be quite good and entertaining. It is a good setup up for a series and makes you want to see more of it. But I also get the feeling that there is not enough in it. A lot of good scenes were rumored to be cut. I will not go into detail about that here in this review since I don't want this to have any spoilers. I just hope that all these good scenes were filmed and will pop up in a future release someday. I don't know all the people who hate this movie. I will tell you right now, if you aren't a Power Rangers fan, there is no reason to watch this movie and no reason to flood this site with bad reviews because if it. But I like this movie and I recommend it for Power Rangers fan. It isn't as bad as some people think and I figure you might enjoy it to, provided you liked the classic seasons.

    I was shocked,surprised and horrified by the negative reviews and the low ratings I would see on the web, i don't know why anyone hates that movie and why is it called the worst movie ever? I thought this film was a very good power rangers movie it was one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life Not worse than Disaster movie but the 1st Power rangers Movie (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie) was pretty good the Zords are great the acting is awesome the plot makes sense Jason and Kimberley are in it but Too bad That Billy and Trini and Zack are not in it the best part in the turbo movie was the part when the 4 rangers got the turbo powers the funniest part of this movie is an amusing cameo from Rita and Lord Zedd. and it was a great film all the kids and Power Rangers fans enjoyed it, including myself, Turbo a Power Rangers Movie was a Big first Episode before Power Rangers Turbo and it's the best power rangers movie It's not bad as the people that give it a 1 I say. Trust me, this is not a 1 star movie, Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2 and Son of the Mask and Disaster Movie are 1 star movies. if you never watch Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie then Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is what you want it's not the worst movie ever, It's a must see for any Power Ranger fan! and fun For the whole family

    I love Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie, some good clean fun, but this movie is just embarrassing, and nowhere near as fun. The plot centres around an extraterrestrial wizard named Lerigot, who goes to Earth in order to avoid capture by a crazed alien queen, Divatox (no, seriously). She plans to use Lerigot to open up a portal so that she can marry an evil dark creature, Maligore, and unite their powers. Naturally, the Power Rangers must stop this. Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is nowhere near as much fun or cool to watch as the first movie. Most notably, Aisha and Billy are completely missing, with no explanation, and Kimberly is no longer a Power Ranger either for some reason, even though she has an important part in the film, thankfully, along with old regular Jason. Rocky is technically there, but he suffers an injury at the start of the film, as if trying to get him out of it, which is sad. Then we have a new blue ranger, Justin, who really is much too young to be a Ranger. A more serious problem is the Zords. The whole mythology around the Power Rangers is much lamer here. The Zords are no longer kinds of animals, they are now all cars, called "Turbo" powers, which just feels nowhere near as imaginative. At a pivotal point of the film, the car Zords merge into what I find hard to describe as anything but a Transformers rip-off. Even worse than that, though, is the fact that the Power Rangers, in Power Ranger form, have so little screen time. Furthermore, the plot is terribly paced, and not very fun to follow. The Rangers have to travel to another dimension via an old pirate ship. Seriously? In the first half hour, a lot of time is wasted with the Rangers trying to find Lerigot, and some insufferable scenes of him wandering around the jungle. Nothing hangs together at all. Remember how central the very concept of being a Power Ranger was to the first movie? Here, it feels like little more than a gimmick. Lerigot is a body-sized puppet who looks like an extra from The Dark Crystal. With his wide doe eyes and nonsensical slurring, he gets on your nerves very quickly, and he just does not stop. The rest of the supporting cast is just as bad. Divatox's henchmen are just laughably embarrassing, especially the insufferable Elgar. Remember Goldar, and Mordant? Those were entertaining henchmen. Maligore, for a supposed unstoppable force of evil, is incredibly ungainly and ineffective. Divatox herself is amusing and Hilary Shephard Turner clearly has a lot of fun with the role, but her overacting gets a little over the top. All the puns are so self-conscious as if the writer were self-aware how bad it would turn out. The special effects are much poorer than in the first movie, too, especially Zordon (he barely looks like he's talking) and Maligore's crater (amateur bluescreen mistake there). Thank goodness Alpha is as good as ever. The best part of the movie is an amusing cameo from Rita and Lord Zedd. That's about a minute in length, and it made the movie for me. Too bad that the rest isn't as fun to watch. Not even having Kimberly and Jason there can help, really. There's none of the spirit of adventure from the first movie. Do yourself a favour and pass this one up, you're not really missing anything. Watch Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers instead.

    As a kid my older brother liked power rangers a lot. The original show, was very similar to the Batman show in the 60s. It was cheesy, silly but in all very entertaining for its camp value. The movie was okay, but with its clich&eacute;s and dumb pointless moments kind of killed it. In 1997 a kind of sequel came out and it's as exiting as...watching the grass grow. There was only 25 minutes of time where you see the power rangers. 25 MINUTES!!! The plot (or at least as much plot as I could find in this) is that some lady named Devatox is hunting down a wizard, Laragou, who looks like an ewok with the face of Dr. Zaius from planet of the apes, to of course, take over the world. The power rangers have no choice but to intervene. I should also mention that about five minutes of the time the power rangers are in there costumes there looking for the bad guys lair. I mean WOW... I mean why is even called Power Rangers? Why not "KIDS WHO FIGHT BAD GUYS AND WEAR THE SAME COLORS EVERYDAY", at least that would make sense! SPOILER: The final battle looks like crap. Somehow, they made the megazord look MORE like multi-colored cardboard boxes... In all the movie sucks, and is a big disappointment to anyone who loved Power Rangers like I did.

    My experience with this horrible waste of celluloid was bringing my 3, 6 and 9 year old, all Power Ranger fans, to this stinker. Although enraptured by the first movie, none of them could sit still for this one and ended up rolling in the aisles rather than watching it. This movie does everything wrong:... Talking vs Action: The worst thing you can do with a movie is to put in too much dialogue and this has WAY too much in spades - ESPECIALLY for a child's movie! Most of the movie is nothing more than actors walking around sets explaining plot details with absolutely no action until 50 minutes into the movie! 50 minutes of talking and explanation in a child's movie?!?! Really? Who wrote this?! Not only that, the Power Rangers don't actually get involved in any action until 1 hour and 10 minutes into the film!!.... Sex over Budget: It's a common B-Movie mantra that when you don't have money for location shoots, special effects or name actors - let loose the cheesecake! I can understand following this maxim in a slasher flick or teen comedy but a child's movie?! The main 'villainess' is clad in full dominatrix gear showing plenty of ample cleavage, thighs, legs and even her navel as the costume has a line going down her stomach. Much of the movie she poses and mugs at the camera while giving commands - fine for a regular B-Movie... but Power Rangers?! There are numerous close-ups and elevator shots of the female cast members including an elevator-to close up shot of the blond power ranger ending at her bust and another fade-in to close-up of Kimberly's butt as she lays face down on the island. My nine year old actually made a comment that Kim's butt was basically the whole screen. I'm no prude but WHO is this movie written for? What does this make up for? No action and an ending where the Power Rangers fight a guy in a rubber suit!? Summary: This is the perfect example of a movie put together by a director who had absolutely no idea what he was doing. This is bad as a kid's movie and bad as an adult movie - it's just plain bad!

    Power Rangers Turbo: The Television Series is better than Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie! Yes, it should be the other way around, movies are meant to be better than TV, but they got it very wrong here! The series was filled with Elgar the comical mutant dropping jokes all the time but I can't even remember if Elgar is even in the movie! Adding to this, I don't like that short stupid looking creature that appears in this film. About the only pleasing part of the film was interesting footage of the submarine and that just comes from my liking of submarines. The first Power Rangers movie was a lot better than this and it is not too hard to understand why Turbo was the last PR movie!

    The Power Rangers must journey towards an island that houses the evil Malagore, in order to stop Divatox from unleashing the creature of pure destruction...In my opinion the film was fine but what followed was the end of the entire series in my opinion...The film had a good cast, brining back characters like Jason and Kimberly...But what really annoyed me was the addition of Justin the kid Ranger!!! This wasn't like the previous movie, with new versions of armoury..it was just a very long episode...The end fight scene was satisfactory but after waiting throughout the whole film for an amazing fight scene it is kind of disappointing to only witness 3-4 minutes worth of action....It was entertaining nonetheless...

    I was eleven years old when this second Power Rangers movie came out. I know some fans had gone off the Rangers by the time they were that age, but I didn't mature as fast as them. So, I was still a big fan when this film came out (I was even still a big fan a year later), and remember watching it over and over for a while. Now, believe me, if I didn't see it then, I would NOT have bothered watching it ten years later, but because of the wonderful memories, I decided to do so. Obviously, it wasn't the same. Divatox, an evil alien pirate, plans to go to the island of Muranthias on Earth, where she intends to release an evil creature named Maligore and marry him. In order to do this, she will need Lerigot, a good wizard, so she plans to have him kidnapped! Fortunately, the wizard manages to escape to Earth, seeking help. Tommy and Katherine go to find him in Africa, and teleport him back to the command centre. However, Lerigot soon decides to surrender after it is learned that Divatox has captured his wife and child! After this, the evil space pirate and her crew head toward the island, and it's obviously up to the Power Rangers to try and stop her, but before they set out, Zordon and Alpha 5 give them new powers called "Turbo powers"! Where do I start in describing this movie? Well, first of all, there are some pretty poor quality characters. I would say the worst is probably Divatox, who was the Rangers' main enemy in the "Power Rangers Turbo" series. She basically acts like a bratty kid, and it seems her antics are supposed to be funny, but at an adult's perspective, they're quite embarrassing. Hilary Shepard puts on a VERY poor performance in this role! Nobody in the cast is very impressive, but most of them do a better job than her! Another character who brings the movie down in quality a bit is Justin, the new Blue Ranger, who is a lot younger than the rest. He's certainly not the only character with lame lines, but it seems his are often worse than most of the others. None of the characters stand out as really good, but clearly, some do stand out as remarkably bad. As you can probably tell from the above paragraph, this movie has a poor script, and the acting generally isn't so good. If you're an adult who is at all familiar with Power Rangers, I'm sure none of this surprises you. Now, sometimes when a movie is bad, it can be unintentionally funny. A few months ago, I watched "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" (which I had never seen before), and around the beginning, I found that it was mildly amusing, but was disappointed to find that the amusement soon went away. Watching this movie after that one, I was hoping for some more unintentional humour, but didn't really find any of that, apart from the scene where the Power Rangers have just gotten their new Turbo powers, and say things like "This is great!" (with a thumbs up) and "This is awesome!" As a straight male, there's one thing I got out of this movie that I wouldn't have when I was eleven, which was the looks/physique of certain female actors, including Nakia Burrise and Catherine Sutherland who play Tanya and Katherine (the two female Rangers of the time), and I guess even Hilary Shepard who plays the dreadful main villain, but this obviously didn't make the entire film for me. Now, I must admit that watching "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" again after all these years wasn't quite the same as watching "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" for the first time earlier this year. It didn't seem QUITE as bad, even though it's generally considered inferior to its predecessor. In fact, call me crazy, but I found that some parts weren't too bad at all, though I wouldn't say I exactly enjoyed the movie. However, I guess the fact that I actually saw it in my childhood is a major part of this, and if I just watched it for the first time, it probably would have been very similar to the experience I had with its predecessor, watching it for the first time way too late. For those who saw this movie in their childhood and are now adults, if you're curious to see what you would think of it now, I wouldn't say that's a bad idea, but not a very good one, either. For everyone else beyond their childhood, I think you know to just stay away. I may look like a fool watching "Turbo" at my age and then writing a long, negative review (after all, it is a kids' movie), but like I said, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't seen it at a much earlier age.

    I was a fan of the series even into '97. This movie made absolutely no sense. When I was 9, I thought it was cool to have a kid be a Power Panger...now I look back on it and cringe...they must've been desperate to keep people interested. And I do believe that we've already had a classic animated series in the '80s featuring cars turning into giant robots and it has a hit movie out now with Shia LaBeouf (Shia, if I spelled your name wrong, I'm sorry) called...I don't know...(cough)TRANS-(cough)-FORMERS(cough)! Bottom line, this movie would have a tough time surpassing Jaws 4...there I said it, as ashamed as I am to say it. (aside: I use Jaws 4 as a comparison to other films that are worse than bad to try and give an idea of how bad a film really is).

It looks like the TV show the effects which for a movie of this supposed magnitude should have rocked the house with the then new improved CGI instead looked like LASER FLOYD anyone remember that one neither do I.

I can understand following this maxim in a slasher flick or teen comedy but a child's movie?! The main 'villainess' is clad in full dominatrix gear showing plenty of ample cleavage, thighs, legs and even her navel as the costume has a line going down her stomach. Much of the movie she poses and mugs at the camera while giving commands - fine for a regular B-Movie... but Power Rangers?! There are numerous close-ups and elevator shots of the female cast members including an elevator-to close up shot of the blond power ranger ending at her bust and another fade-in to close-up of Kimberly's butt as she lays face down on the island. My nine year old actually made a comment that Kim's butt was basically the whole screen. I'm no prude but WHO is this movie written for? What does this make up for? No action and an ending where the Power Rangers fight a guy in a rubber suit!? Summary: This is the perfect example of a movie put together by a director who had absolutely no idea what he was doing. This is bad as a kid's movie and bad as an adult movie - it's just plain bad!

    Power Rangers Turbo: The Television Series is better than Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie! Yes, it should be the other way around, movies are meant to be better than TV, but they got it very wrong here! The series was filled with Elgar the comical mutant dropping jokes all the time but I can't even remember if Elgar is even in the movie! Adding to this, I don't like that short stupid looking creature that appears in this film. About the only pleasing part of the film was interesting footage of the submarine and that just comes from my liking of submarines. The first Power Rangers movie was a lot better than this and it is not too hard to understand why Turbo was the last PR movie!

    The Power Rangers must journey towards an island that houses the evil Malagore, in order to stop Divatox from unleashing the creature of pure destruction...In my opinion the film was fine but what followed was the end of the entire series in my opinion...The film had a good cast, brining back characters like Jason and Kimberly...But what really annoyed me was the addition of Justin the kid Ranger!!! This wasn't like the previous movie, with new versions of armoury..it was just a very long episode...The end fight scene was satisfactory but after waiting throughout the whole film for an amazing fight scene it is kind of disappointing to only witness 3-4 minutes worth of action....It was entertaining nonetheless...

    I was eleven years old when this second Power Rangers movie came out. I know some fans had gone off the Rangers by the time they were that age, but I didn't mature as fast as them. So, I was still a big fan when this film came out (I was even still a big fan a year later), and remember watching it over and over for a while. Now, believe me, if I didn't see it then, I would NOT have bothered watching it ten years later, but because of the wonderful memories, I decided to do so. Obviously, it wasn't the same. Divatox, an evil alien pirate, plans to go to the island of Muranthias on Earth, where she intends to release an evil creature named Maligore and marry him. In order to do this, she will need Lerigot, a good wizard, so she plans to have him kidnapped! Fortunately, the wizard manages to escape to Earth, seeking help. Tommy and Katherine go to find him in Africa, and teleport him back to the command centre. However, Lerigot soon decides to surrender after it is learned that Divatox has captured his wife and child! After this, the evil space pirate and her crew head toward the island, and it's obviously up to the Power Rangers to try and stop her, but before they set out, Zordon and Alpha 5 give them new powers called "Turbo powers"! Where do I start in describing this movie? Well, first of all, there are some pretty poor quality characters. I would say the worst is probably Divatox, who was the Rangers' main enemy in the "Power Rangers Turbo" series. She basically acts like a bratty kid, and it seems her antics are supposed to be funny, but at an adult's perspective, they're quite embarrassing. Hilary Shepard puts on a VERY poor performance in this role! Nobody in the cast is very impressive, but most of them do a better job than her! Another character who brings the movie down in quality a bit is Justin, the new Blue Ranger, who is a lot younger than the rest. He's certainly not the only character with lame lines, but it seems his are often worse than most of the others. None of the characters stand out as really good, but clearly, some do stand out as remarkably bad. As you can probably tell from the above paragraph, this movie has a poor script, and the acting generally isn't so good. If you're an adult who is at all familiar with Power Rangers, I'm sure none of this surprises you. Now, sometimes when a movie is bad, it can be unintentionally funny. A few months ago, I watched "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" (which I had never seen before), and around the beginning, I found that it was mildly amusing, but was disappointed to find that the amusement soon went away. Watching this movie after that one, I was hoping for some more unintentional humour, but didn't really find any of that, apart from the scene where the Power Rangers have just gotten their new Turbo powers, and say things like "This is great!" (with a thumbs up) and "This is awesome!" As a straight male, there's one thing I got out of this movie that I wouldn't have when I was eleven, which was the looks/physique of certain female actors, including Nakia Burrise and Catherine Sutherland who play Tanya and Katherine (the two female Rangers of the time), and I guess even Hilary Shepard who plays the dreadful main villain, but this obviously didn't make the entire film for me. Now, I must admit that watching "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" again after all these years wasn't quite the same as watching "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie" for the first time earlier this year. It didn't seem QUITE as bad, even though it's generally considered inferior to its predecessor. In fact, call me crazy, but I found that some parts weren't too bad at all, though I wouldn't say I exactly enjoyed the movie. However, I guess the fact that I actually saw it in my childhood is a major part of this, and if I just watched it for the first time, it probably would have been very similar to the experience I had with its predecessor, watching it for the first time way too late. For those who saw this movie in their childhood and are now adults, if you're curious to see what you would think of it now, I wouldn't say that's a bad idea, but not a very good one, either. For everyone else beyond their childhood, I think you know to just stay away. I may look like a fool watching "Turbo" at my age and then writing a long, negative review (after all, it is a kids' movie), but like I said, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't seen it at a much earlier age.

    I was a fan of the series even into '97. This movie made absolutely no sense. When I was 9, I thought it was cool to have a kid be a Power Panger...now I look back on it and cringe...they must've been desperate to keep people interested. And I do believe that we've already had a classic animated series in the '80s featuring cars turning into giant robots and it has a hit movie out now with Shia LaBeouf (Shia, if I spelled your name wrong, I'm sorry) called...I don't know...(cough)TRANS-(cough)-FORMERS(cough)! Bottom line, this movie would have a tough time surpassing Jaws 4...there I said it, as ashamed as I am to say it. (aside: I use Jaws 4 as a comparison to other films that are worse than bad to try and give an idea of how bad a film really is).

    Saw it once at 9-10 years old did not care for it although I was syked when I heard Jason (Austin St. John) the original Red Ranger and the greatest ranger of all time period! Saw it again yesterday and same thing did not care for it. It looks like the TV show the effects which for a movie of this supposed magnitude should have rocked the house with the then new improved CGI instead looked like LASER FLOYD anyone remember that one neither do I. The plot is really thin and the spoilers are given away almost immediately with the trailers and interviews the only part with the Turbo Megazord was too short 5 mins and face it if there was no zords the show would not have lasted as long as it did or less than that MMPR: the movie's Ninja Megazord had at least 15-20 mins of screen time and had impressive CGI at least at that time it did. The major baddie Mali...something was not threatening at all MMPR had more impressive monsters than this rubberized reject but I give it a four because of a hinted romance between Jason and Kimberly I mean who goes out with a girl solo and still be just friends plus they acted a little too friendly around each other flirting and whatnot and were hardly seen without each other and only fraternizing with each other if that doesn't say love I don't know what does. Even though we get the big three of power rangers I mean everyone knows these guys Jason (the compassionate leader) Kimberly (The heart of the team and she's pretty damn hot) and Tommy (the favorite and pretty boy of the group) the character development well face it there was none plummets this from movie to one overlong action kiddie show. I also give it a four because out goes Rocky Jason's replacement and the most annoying of the original MMMPR and then Blue Zeo Ranger YES!!!!! and enter Justin the other immensely annoying Blue Ranger NOOOOOO!!!!! All in all the return of Jason and Kimberly couldn't save this one from the pointless action sequences thin plot and annoying character of Justin it was better off with a direct to video release even Die Hard fans may want to steer clear of this one
