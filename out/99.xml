 <sinopse>
  Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The first, and by far most memorable full-length animated feature from the Disney Studios, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" may have been superseded technically by many of the films that followed it. But its simple story of a charming little princess saved from the evil deeds of her wicked step-mother, the queen, by a group of seven adorable dwarfs made history when it was first released in December, 1937 and has since become an incomparable screen classic.

    No one believed it would succeed. Everyone called it "Disney's Folly". And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. "Beauty and the Beast", "The Lion King", "Toy Story", and "Finding Nemo" all owe to this movie: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, "Snow White" has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. "Snow White" stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss. The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with "Heigh-ho" and "Someday my Prince will Come" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development. So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.

    dear sir,I like to read about fairy tales whether shortened or in a long form.I think animation movies are good.I think there were animation stories from kerala and from India,where I reside.I think animation stories are good for the entire family-maybe only a few get a x certificate-ie for those who are particular.I think Walt Disney was a good maker of animation movies.I think animation movies are good,I guess that there was a animation movie called gatotkatcha in Hindi which is about a character from the Indian Mahabharata-well he was the son of Bhima who was of great help in the pandavas fight against the kauravas.In the clash he died like a true hero.He had a lot of magical power-he used to dispatch weapons from heaven,though he was born someone like a ogre-i guess he fought on the virtuous side.thanks

    I'm usually generous when it comes to reviewing, I like to pick out the best parts in movies and say little about negative parts, but this, this had to be a negative review and if you're a Snow White Fan and you think it's the best Disney movie, keep scrolling. You're not going to like this. The thing that bothers me is that there's absolutely no substance to the story or the characters. I blame the time setting, 1937. Things weren't as advanced, animation is impressive but that's it. Walt Disney didn't really give personality to the characters, develop the story line. He just thought: damsel in distress, wicked and evil stepmother and handsome prince to rescue the damsel. End of story. Also, there was a poor shot at trying to make the screen time with the dwarfs funny, they were as annoying as Snow White. All seven were named after emotions or a symptom. Very clever *rolls eyes* Now, Snow White on the other hand is utterly and completely sugary sweet. Her voice makes me want to hit her, the way she flounces about the place singing at everything. How innocent she plays out to be.. ugh. Compare that dullness to the likes of other Disney Princess's like Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas, Rapunzel etc. Then she's totally bland. In a way, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt.. they did try. Apparently if Disney's Cinderella wasn't successful, then they would've had to shut down, hence, my point. Snow White was that bad and just laughable that they were nearly out of business. Now the fans. They're obviously ass kissing. How could you like Snow White in any way? My theory is, is that they're rooting for the movie because it's Disney's first full feature length film. No offence to Walt Disney but after he died, the story lines improved and gained success and attention. The characters were more memorable, fun and the movies were a huge hit. Disney started everything, so I should be grateful because I am a huge fan but one thing's for sure is that Disney wouldn't have had a chance if it wasn't for Cinderella. In my opinion, still a very cheap and low chance at a film. Again, back to the time frame. What was it? 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960? Then Walt Disney died and movies improved? Quite suspicious to be honest. In conclusion, I hated this movie and that evil old woman who was the wicked stepmother was terrifying! How could kids sit and like this movie without covering their eyes and crying? Just how? I would avoid this movie at any cost-- unless you're just curious at Disney's attempt at this abomination,

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a significant piece of American film history for many reasons, chief among them being that it was the first full-length animated feature ever made. This film was also responsible for influencing other landmark fantasy/sci-fi flicks such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Star Wars (1977), and the gratitude from critics and audiences alike for its existence will not cease for quite some time. That being said, does Walt Disney's 1937 animated landmark film hold up as a piece of cinema today aside from its importance and our memories of watching it as a kid? My answer to that question is yes. I think it's safe to say that most of us know the story to this one. An evil queen has learned from her magic mirror that her stepdaughter Snow White is considered "the fairest one of all" and this causes the queen to be jealous. She becomes so jealous in fact that she sends out her loyal huntsman to kill her stepdaughter. But the huntsman is unable to pull off this task and orders Snow White to run away and never come back. Lost, confused, and alone, she finds a cottage in the woods which is occupied by seven little dwarfs where she seeks shelter and protection from the queen's evil plans. The story behind the making of this picture is simply amazing. The production of this movie lasted for 4 &frac12; years and during that production, many complications aroused. From the seemingly endless increase in the production's costs to the skepticism from everybody (including Disney's growing staff of animators) regarding whether or not anyone will watch a feature length cartoon (mainly because many feared that the film would run out of gags or the colors would be too bright). If that didn't sound dramatic enough yet for whatever reason, they didn't settle on the names of the dwarfs until under a year before the film came out and the film itself was completed 2 &frac12; weeks before its release (imagine the amount of work they had to do with the advertising and whatnot). Just hearing what I just said alone, it's miraculous that the film did outstanding financially and critically. Otherwise, the Disney studios would have probably gone out of business due to the film's costs. It really is an amazing success story and is sure to give those who currently resent the Disney Company's ways a better respect for what Walt Disney himself had accomplished. As for the quality of the film itself, it still holds up pretty well. The animation is still as breathtaking and impressively detailed as it was in 1937. It's all the more outstanding if you look at the landmark black-and-white Mickey Mouse short, Steamboat Willie (1928) and look at the very basic animation used in that short and then look at the more realistic animation in this film. By doing that, you can obtain a much deeper appreciation of just how far the animation studio had come during that era. The progress that studio made from Steamboat Willie to Snow White is unbelievable. It truly does have to be seen to be believed. The music from Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Paul Smith is filled with songs we all know and love from "Heigh Ho" to "Someday My Prince Will Come". Even though Snow White's singing voice may be a little too much for some tastes, the songs still have nice lyrics and a terrific melody to them. The background musical score is simply wonderful from beginning to end. It really gives this landmark achievement in filmmaking the epic scope and memorability that it rightfully deserves. Ever since this film, most of Disney's animated features have been musicals and one could easily say that Snow White started a great tradition. It further explains why animation and music are practically peanut butter and jelly in the film industry. The characters in this movie that hold up the best are easily the seven dwarfs. Nowadays, I feel like I talk similarly to the way Doc talks in this feature in that he mixes up his words more than a couple times but still makes wise decisions. I think we all know someone in our own personal lives who acts like Grumpy. As for Dopey, he rightfully deserves comparison with the great pantomime clowns like Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. The storytellers did a great job at bringing the personalities of the dwarfs to life. Snow White and the prince himself are a little underdeveloped character wise, but to be fair, it was difficult drawing these characters around the time this film came out. If it wasn't for the existence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, we probably still wouldn't know what kind of films to make for our kids, and we probably wouldn't have much in the way of either animated films or sci-fi/fantasy films. Many of us including myself will be forever grateful for what Walt Disney and his staff of animators have accomplished with this film. It was a terrific film to see during my childhood and it was worthy revisiting it as a young adult and appreciating it as a giant landmark in the history of American filmmaking.

    How do you even review a movie that you grew up with, without being fully nostalgic? Without having a bias towards it because you know it so well? I don't think you can, which is partly why I love this movie. It's completely wonderful and charming, but the fact that it brings up such nostalgic feelings, and I can recite every line, make it nearly perfect. The evil queen is so, well, evil! She is so evil, she is willing to make herself the ugliest old hag around in order to kill poor, sweet Snow White! Snow White, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most gentle young girl (she is only 14, you know). She wouldn't hurt a fly! And, of course, the dwarfs are the humor in the story. Grumpy is my favorite! All in all, this movie is truly a 10. Walt Disney was an absolute genius!

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether. The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her. Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White. The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright. The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like "Heigh Ho", and "Someday My Prince Will Come" add more depth into our characters and the story. Perfect If you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason

    There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure. Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine. As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha. The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith. Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the "Whistle While You Work", "Heigh-Ho", "I'm wishing" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one. The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.

    Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house. The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White. Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple. It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com

    A movie milestone, a legend that started the beauty and majesty that is Disney. A revolutionary film, unlike any other before it and a movie that has managed to endure the test of time. As you can see, I absolutely love this film. It was the first film I was given as a gift when I was a child, and thus it was the first film that I ever owned. It wasn't the first film I ever saw, at least I don't think it was, but it was the first Disney film of my life, and it left a lasting impression. I was pretty much hooked from the very first scene, and why wouldn't I be. The Disney company got a lot of things right, even if none of them had ever done anything like this before, and you can recognize many of their future trademarks in this film. The complexity of the backgrounds, the fairytale morality and good's triumph over evil, the grace and beauty of movement, the masterful use of music to tell a story and to enhance the mood during otherwise silent scenes, the colourful characters... they're all there. Not to say that the film's age doesn't show in certain scenes and aspects of the story. For example, the plot, while good and captivating, is a bit simplistic and in the end the conflict is solved rather easily. The characters, and especially the queen, have a tendency to speak directly towards the "camera", which is pretty much unheard of in modern days, but I think that in this case it actually improves the film, because it's just so unsettling when the evil queen stares right into your eyes while cackling like a madwoman. Also the songs aren't up to Disney's usual standards, though they aren't bad. They're just more simplistic and shorter than some of the legendary songs that Disney would later produce. So yeah, this is a masterpiece, absolute wonder of film making and a film that has earned its eternal place in the classics. And it's still just as good as it was back then so there's absolutely no reason not to watch it every now and then.

    The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman. Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse). Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are "I'm Wishing," "Whistle While You Work," "Hi Ho," and "Someday My Prince Will Come." A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying. Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.

In my opinion, still a very cheap and low chance at a film. Again, back to the time frame. What was it? 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960? Then Walt Disney died and movies improved? Quite suspicious to be honest. In conclusion, I hated this movie and that evil old woman who was the wicked stepmother was terrifying! How could kids sit and like this movie without covering their eyes and crying? Just how? I would avoid this movie at any cost-- unless you're just curious at Disney's attempt at this abomination,

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a significant piece of American film history for many reasons, chief among them being that it was the first full-length animated feature ever made. This film was also responsible for influencing other landmark fantasy/sci-fi flicks such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Star Wars (1977), and the gratitude from critics and audiences alike for its existence will not cease for quite some time. That being said, does Walt Disney's 1937 animated landmark film hold up as a piece of cinema today aside from its importance and our memories of watching it as a kid? My answer to that question is yes. I think it's safe to say that most of us know the story to this one. An evil queen has learned from her magic mirror that her stepdaughter Snow White is considered "the fairest one of all" and this causes the queen to be jealous. She becomes so jealous in fact that she sends out her loyal huntsman to kill her stepdaughter. But the huntsman is unable to pull off this task and orders Snow White to run away and never come back. Lost, confused, and alone, she finds a cottage in the woods which is occupied by seven little dwarfs where she seeks shelter and protection from the queen's evil plans. The story behind the making of this picture is simply amazing. The production of this movie lasted for 4 &frac12; years and during that production, many complications aroused. From the seemingly endless increase in the production's costs to the skepticism from everybody (including Disney's growing staff of animators) regarding whether or not anyone will watch a feature length cartoon (mainly because many feared that the film would run out of gags or the colors would be too bright). If that didn't sound dramatic enough yet for whatever reason, they didn't settle on the names of the dwarfs until under a year before the film came out and the film itself was completed 2 &frac12; weeks before its release (imagine the amount of work they had to do with the advertising and whatnot). Just hearing what I just said alone, it's miraculous that the film did outstanding financially and critically. Otherwise, the Disney studios would have probably gone out of business due to the film's costs. It really is an amazing success story and is sure to give those who currently resent the Disney Company's ways a better respect for what Walt Disney himself had accomplished. As for the quality of the film itself, it still holds up pretty well. The animation is still as breathtaking and impressively detailed as it was in 1937. It's all the more outstanding if you look at the landmark black-and-white Mickey Mouse short, Steamboat Willie (1928) and look at the very basic animation used in that short and then look at the more realistic animation in this film. By doing that, you can obtain a much deeper appreciation of just how far the animation studio had come during that era. The progress that studio made from Steamboat Willie to Snow White is unbelievable. It truly does have to be seen to be believed. The music from Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Paul Smith is filled with songs we all know and love from "Heigh Ho" to "Someday My Prince Will Come". Even though Snow White's singing voice may be a little too much for some tastes, the songs still have nice lyrics and a terrific melody to them. The background musical score is simply wonderful from beginning to end. It really gives this landmark achievement in filmmaking the epic scope and memorability that it rightfully deserves. Ever since this film, most of Disney's animated features have been musicals and one could easily say that Snow White started a great tradition. It further explains why animation and music are practically peanut butter and jelly in the film industry. The characters in this movie that hold up the best are easily the seven dwarfs. Nowadays, I feel like I talk similarly to the way Doc talks in this feature in that he mixes up his words more than a couple times but still makes wise decisions. I think we all know someone in our own personal lives who acts like Grumpy. As for Dopey, he rightfully deserves comparison with the great pantomime clowns like Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. The storytellers did a great job at bringing the personalities of the dwarfs to life. Snow White and the prince himself are a little underdeveloped character wise, but to be fair, it was difficult drawing these characters around the time this film came out. If it wasn't for the existence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, we probably still wouldn't know what kind of films to make for our kids, and we probably wouldn't have much in the way of either animated films or sci-fi/fantasy films. Many of us including myself will be forever grateful for what Walt Disney and his staff of animators have accomplished with this film. It was a terrific film to see during my childhood and it was worthy revisiting it as a young adult and appreciating it as a giant landmark in the history of American filmmaking.

    How do you even review a movie that you grew up with, without being fully nostalgic? Without having a bias towards it because you know it so well? I don't think you can, which is partly why I love this movie. It's completely wonderful and charming, but the fact that it brings up such nostalgic feelings, and I can recite every line, make it nearly perfect. The evil queen is so, well, evil! She is so evil, she is willing to make herself the ugliest old hag around in order to kill poor, sweet Snow White! Snow White, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most gentle young girl (she is only 14, you know). She wouldn't hurt a fly! And, of course, the dwarfs are the humor in the story. Grumpy is my favorite! All in all, this movie is truly a 10. Walt Disney was an absolute genius!

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether. The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her. Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White. The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright. The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like "Heigh Ho", and "Someday My Prince Will Come" add more depth into our characters and the story. Perfect If you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason

    There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure. Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine. As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha. The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith. Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the "Whistle While You Work", "Heigh-Ho", "I'm wishing" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one. The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.

    Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house. The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White. Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple. It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com

    A movie milestone, a legend that started the beauty and majesty that is Disney. A revolutionary film, unlike any other before it and a movie that has managed to endure the test of time. As you can see, I absolutely love this film. It was the first film I was given as a gift when I was a child, and thus it was the first film that I ever owned. It wasn't the first film I ever saw, at least I don't think it was, but it was the first Disney film of my life, and it left a lasting impression. I was pretty much hooked from the very first scene, and why wouldn't I be. The Disney company got a lot of things right, even if none of them had ever done anything like this before, and you can recognize many of their future trademarks in this film. The complexity of the backgrounds, the fairytale morality and good's triumph over evil, the grace and beauty of movement, the masterful use of music to tell a story and to enhance the mood during otherwise silent scenes, the colourful characters... they're all there. Not to say that the film's age doesn't show in certain scenes and aspects of the story. For example, the plot, while good and captivating, is a bit simplistic and in the end the conflict is solved rather easily. The characters, and especially the queen, have a tendency to speak directly towards the "camera", which is pretty much unheard of in modern days, but I think that in this case it actually improves the film, because it's just so unsettling when the evil queen stares right into your eyes while cackling like a madwoman. Also the songs aren't up to Disney's usual standards, though they aren't bad. They're just more simplistic and shorter than some of the legendary songs that Disney would later produce. So yeah, this is a masterpiece, absolute wonder of film making and a film that has earned its eternal place in the classics. And it's still just as good as it was back then so there's absolutely no reason not to watch it every now and then.

    The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman. Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse). Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are "I'm Wishing," "Whistle While You Work," "Hi Ho," and "Someday My Prince Will Come." A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying. Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.

    No one believed it would succeed. Everyone called it "Disney's Folly". And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. "Beauty and the Beast", "The Lion King", "Toy Story", and "Finding Nemo" all owe to this movie: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, "Snow White" has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. "Snow White" stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss. The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with "Heigh-ho" and "Someday my Prince will Come" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development. So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.

    dear sir,I like to read about fairy tales whether shortened or in a long form.I think animation movies are good.I think there were animation stories from kerala and from India,where I reside.I think animation stories are good for the entire family-maybe only a few get a x certificate-ie for those who are particular.I think Walt Disney was a good maker of animation movies.I think animation movies are good,I guess that there was a animation movie called gatotkatcha in Hindi which is about a character from the Indian Mahabharata-well he was the son of Bhima who was of great help in the pandavas fight against the kauravas.In the clash he died like a true hero.He had a lot of magical power-he used to dispatch weapons from heaven,though he was born someone like a ogre-i guess he fought on the virtuous side.thanks

    I'm usually generous when it comes to reviewing, I like to pick out the best parts in movies and say little about negative parts, but this, this had to be a negative review and if you're a Snow White Fan and you think it's the best Disney movie, keep scrolling. You're not going to like this. The thing that bothers me is that there's absolutely no substance to the story or the characters. I blame the time setting, 1937. Things weren't as advanced, animation is impressive but that's it. Walt Disney didn't really give personality to the characters, develop the story line. He just thought: damsel in distress, wicked and evil stepmother and handsome prince to rescue the damsel. End of story. Also, there was a poor shot at trying to make the screen time with the dwarfs funny, they were as annoying as Snow White. All seven were named after emotions or a symptom. Very clever *rolls eyes* Now, Snow White on the other hand is utterly and completely sugary sweet. Her voice makes me want to hit her, the way she flounces about the place singing at everything. How innocent she plays out to be.. ugh. Compare that dullness to the likes of other Disney Princess's like Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas, Rapunzel etc. Then she's totally bland. In a way, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt.. they did try. Apparently if Disney's Cinderella wasn't successful, then they would've had to shut down, hence, my point. Snow White was that bad and just laughable that they were nearly out of business. Now the fans. They're obviously ass kissing. How could you like Snow White in any way? My theory is, is that they're rooting for the movie because it's Disney's first full feature length film. No offence to Walt Disney but after he died, the story lines improved and gained success and attention. The characters were more memorable, fun and the movies were a huge hit. Disney started everything, so I should be grateful because I am a huge fan but one thing's for sure is that Disney wouldn't have had a chance if it wasn't for Cinderella. In my opinion, still a very cheap and low chance at a film. Again, back to the time frame. What was it? 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960? Then Walt Disney died and movies improved? Quite suspicious to be honest. In conclusion, I hated this movie and that evil old woman who was the wicked stepmother was terrifying!

All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like "Heigh Ho", and "Someday My Prince Will Come" add more depth into our characters and the story. Perfect If you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason

    There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure. Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine. As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha. The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith. Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the "Whistle While You Work", "Heigh-Ho", "I'm wishing" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one. The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.

    Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house. The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White. Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple. It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com

    A movie milestone, a legend that started the beauty and majesty that is Disney. A revolutionary film, unlike any other before it and a movie that has managed to endure the test of time. As you can see, I absolutely love this film. It was the first film I was given as a gift when I was a child, and thus it was the first film that I ever owned. It wasn't the first film I ever saw, at least I don't think it was, but it was the first Disney film of my life, and it left a lasting impression. I was pretty much hooked from the very first scene, and why wouldn't I be. The Disney company got a lot of things right, even if none of them had ever done anything like this before, and you can recognize many of their future trademarks in this film. The complexity of the backgrounds, the fairytale morality and good's triumph over evil, the grace and beauty of movement, the masterful use of music to tell a story and to enhance the mood during otherwise silent scenes, the colourful characters... they're all there. Not to say that the film's age doesn't show in certain scenes and aspects of the story. For example, the plot, while good and captivating, is a bit simplistic and in the end the conflict is solved rather easily. The characters, and especially the queen, have a tendency to speak directly towards the "camera", which is pretty much unheard of in modern days, but I think that in this case it actually improves the film, because it's just so unsettling when the evil queen stares right into your eyes while cackling like a madwoman. Also the songs aren't up to Disney's usual standards, though they aren't bad. They're just more simplistic and shorter than some of the legendary songs that Disney would later produce. So yeah, this is a masterpiece, absolute wonder of film making and a film that has earned its eternal place in the classics. And it's still just as good as it was back then so there's absolutely no reason not to watch it every now and then.

    The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman. Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse). Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are "I'm Wishing," "Whistle While You Work," "Hi Ho," and "Someday My Prince Will Come." A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying. Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.

    No one believed it would succeed. Everyone called it "Disney's Folly". And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. "Beauty and the Beast", "The Lion King", "Toy Story", and "Finding Nemo" all owe to this movie: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, "Snow White" has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. "Snow White" stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss. The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with "Heigh-ho" and "Someday my Prince will Come" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development. So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.

    dear sir,I like to read about fairy tales whether shortened or in a long form.I think animation movies are good.I think there were animation stories from kerala and from India,where I reside.I think animation stories are good for the entire family-maybe only a few get a x certificate-ie for those who are particular.I think Walt Disney was a good maker of animation movies.I think animation movies are good,I guess that there was a animation movie called gatotkatcha in Hindi which is about a character from the Indian Mahabharata-well he was the son of Bhima who was of great help in the pandavas fight against the kauravas.In the clash he died like a true hero.He had a lot of magical power-he used to dispatch weapons from heaven,though he was born someone like a ogre-i guess he fought on the virtuous side.thanks

    I'm usually generous when it comes to reviewing, I like to pick out the best parts in movies and say little about negative parts, but this, this had to be a negative review and if you're a Snow White Fan and you think it's the best Disney movie, keep scrolling. You're not going to like this. The thing that bothers me is that there's absolutely no substance to the story or the characters. I blame the time setting, 1937. Things weren't as advanced, animation is impressive but that's it. Walt Disney didn't really give personality to the characters, develop the story line. He just thought: damsel in distress, wicked and evil stepmother and handsome prince to rescue the damsel. End of story. Also, there was a poor shot at trying to make the screen time with the dwarfs funny, they were as annoying as Snow White. All seven were named after emotions or a symptom. Very clever *rolls eyes* Now, Snow White on the other hand is utterly and completely sugary sweet. Her voice makes me want to hit her, the way she flounces about the place singing at everything. How innocent she plays out to be.. ugh. Compare that dullness to the likes of other Disney Princess's like Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas, Rapunzel etc. Then she's totally bland. In a way, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt.. they did try. Apparently if Disney's Cinderella wasn't successful, then they would've had to shut down, hence, my point. Snow White was that bad and just laughable that they were nearly out of business. Now the fans. They're obviously ass kissing. How could you like Snow White in any way? My theory is, is that they're rooting for the movie because it's Disney's first full feature length film. No offence to Walt Disney but after he died, the story lines improved and gained success and attention. The characters were more memorable, fun and the movies were a huge hit. Disney started everything, so I should be grateful because I am a huge fan but one thing's for sure is that Disney wouldn't have had a chance if it wasn't for Cinderella. In my opinion, still a very cheap and low chance at a film. Again, back to the time frame. What was it? 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960? Then Walt Disney died and movies improved? Quite suspicious to be honest. In conclusion, I hated this movie and that evil old woman who was the wicked stepmother was terrifying! How could kids sit and like this movie without covering their eyes and crying? Just how? I would avoid this movie at any cost-- unless you're just curious at Disney's attempt at this abomination,

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a significant piece of American film history for many reasons, chief among them being that it was the first full-length animated feature ever made. This film was also responsible for influencing other landmark fantasy/sci-fi flicks such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Star Wars (1977), and the gratitude from critics and audiences alike for its existence will not cease for quite some time. That being said, does Walt Disney's 1937 animated landmark film hold up as a piece of cinema today aside from its importance and our memories of watching it as a kid? My answer to that question is yes. I think it's safe to say that most of us know the story to this one. An evil queen has learned from her magic mirror that her stepdaughter Snow White is considered "the fairest one of all" and this causes the queen to be jealous. She becomes so jealous in fact that she sends out her loyal huntsman to kill her stepdaughter. But the huntsman is unable to pull off this task and orders Snow White to run away and never come back. Lost, confused, and alone, she finds a cottage in the woods which is occupied by seven little dwarfs where she seeks shelter and protection from the queen's evil plans. The story behind the making of this picture is simply amazing. The production of this movie lasted for 4 &frac12; years and during that production, many complications aroused. From the seemingly endless increase in the production's costs to the skepticism from everybody (including Disney's growing staff of animators) regarding whether or not anyone will watch a feature length cartoon (mainly because many feared that the film would run out of gags or the colors would be too bright). If that didn't sound dramatic enough yet for whatever reason, they didn't settle on the names of the dwarfs until under a year before the film came out and the film itself was completed 2 &frac12; weeks before its release (imagine the amount of work they had to do with the advertising and whatnot). Just hearing what I just said alone, it's miraculous that the film did outstanding financially and critically. Otherwise, the Disney studios would have probably gone out of business due to the film's costs. It really is an amazing success story and is sure to give those who currently resent the Disney Company's ways a better respect for what Walt Disney himself had accomplished. As for the quality of the film itself, it still holds up pretty well. The animation is still as breathtaking and impressively detailed as it was in 1937. It's all the more outstanding if you look at the landmark black-and-white Mickey Mouse short, Steamboat Willie (1928) and look at the very basic animation used in that short and then look at the more realistic animation in this film. By doing that, you can obtain a much deeper appreciation of just how far the animation studio had come during that era. The progress that studio made from Steamboat Willie to Snow White is unbelievable. It truly does have to be seen to be believed. The music from Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Paul Smith is filled with songs we all know and love from "Heigh Ho" to "Someday My Prince Will Come". Even though Snow White's singing voice may be a little too much for some tastes, the songs still have nice lyrics and a terrific melody to them. The background musical score is simply wonderful from beginning to end. It really gives this landmark achievement in filmmaking the epic scope and memorability that it rightfully deserves. Ever since this film, most of Disney's animated features have been musicals and one could easily say that Snow White started a great tradition. It further explains why animation and music are practically peanut butter and jelly in the film industry. The characters in this movie that hold up the best are easily the seven dwarfs. Nowadays, I feel like I talk similarly to the way Doc talks in this feature in that he mixes up his words more than a couple times but still makes wise decisions. I think we all know someone in our own personal lives who acts like Grumpy. As for Dopey, he rightfully deserves comparison with the great pantomime clowns like Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. The storytellers did a great job at bringing the personalities of the dwarfs to life. Snow White and the prince himself are a little underdeveloped character wise, but to be fair, it was difficult drawing these characters around the time this film came out. If it wasn't for the existence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, we probably still wouldn't know what kind of films to make for our kids, and we probably wouldn't have much in the way of either animated films or sci-fi/fantasy films. Many of us including myself will be forever grateful for what Walt Disney and his staff of animators have accomplished with this film. It was a terrific film to see during my childhood and it was worthy revisiting it as a young adult and appreciating it as a giant landmark in the history of American filmmaking.

    How do you even review a movie that you grew up with, without being fully nostalgic? Without having a bias towards it because you know it so well? I don't think you can, which is partly why I love this movie. It's completely wonderful and charming, but the fact that it brings up such nostalgic feelings, and I can recite every line, make it nearly perfect. The evil queen is so, well, evil! She is so evil, she is willing to make herself the ugliest old hag around in order to kill poor, sweet Snow White! Snow White, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most gentle young girl (she is only 14, you know). She wouldn't hurt a fly! And, of course, the dwarfs are the humor in the story. Grumpy is my favorite! All in all, this movie is truly a 10. Walt Disney was an absolute genius!

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether. The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her. Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White. The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright. The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like "Heigh Ho", and "Someday My Prince Will Come" add more depth into our characters and the story.

    The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman. Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse). Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are "I'm Wishing," "Whistle While You Work," "Hi Ho," and "Someday My Prince Will Come." A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying. Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.

    No one believed it would succeed. Everyone called it "Disney's Folly". And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. "Beauty and the Beast", "The Lion King", "Toy Story", and "Finding Nemo" all owe to this movie: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, "Snow White" has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. "Snow White" stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss. The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with "Heigh-ho" and "Someday my Prince will Come" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development. So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.

    dear sir,I like to read about fairy tales whether shortened or in a long form.I think animation movies are good.I think there were animation stories from kerala and from India,where I reside.I think animation stories are good for the entire family-maybe only a few get a x certificate-ie for those who are particular.I think Walt Disney was a good maker of animation movies.I think animation movies are good,I guess that there was a animation movie called gatotkatcha in Hindi which is about a character from the Indian Mahabharata-well he was the son of Bhima who was of great help in the pandavas fight against the kauravas.In the clash he died like a true hero.He had a lot of magical power-he used to dispatch weapons from heaven,though he was born someone like a ogre-i guess he fought on the virtuous side.thanks

    I'm usually generous when it comes to reviewing, I like to pick out the best parts in movies and say little about negative parts, but this, this had to be a negative review and if you're a Snow White Fan and you think it's the best Disney movie, keep scrolling. You're not going to like this. The thing that bothers me is that there's absolutely no substance to the story or the characters. I blame the time setting, 1937. Things weren't as advanced, animation is impressive but that's it. Walt Disney didn't really give personality to the characters, develop the story line. He just thought: damsel in distress, wicked and evil stepmother and handsome prince to rescue the damsel. End of story. Also, there was a poor shot at trying to make the screen time with the dwarfs funny, they were as annoying as Snow White. All seven were named after emotions or a symptom. Very clever *rolls eyes* Now, Snow White on the other hand is utterly and completely sugary sweet. Her voice makes me want to hit her, the way she flounces about the place singing at everything. How innocent she plays out to be.. ugh. Compare that dullness to the likes of other Disney Princess's like Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas, Rapunzel etc. Then she's totally bland. In a way, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt.. they did try. Apparently if Disney's Cinderella wasn't successful, then they would've had to shut down, hence, my point. Snow White was that bad and just laughable that they were nearly out of business. Now the fans. They're obviously ass kissing. How could you like Snow White in any way? My theory is, is that they're rooting for the movie because it's Disney's first full feature length film. No offence to Walt Disney but after he died, the story lines improved and gained success and attention. The characters were more memorable, fun and the movies were a huge hit. Disney started everything, so I should be grateful because I am a huge fan but one thing's for sure is that Disney wouldn't have had a chance if it wasn't for Cinderella. In my opinion, still a very cheap and low chance at a film. Again, back to the time frame. What was it? 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960? Then Walt Disney died and movies improved? Quite suspicious to be honest. In conclusion, I hated this movie and that evil old woman who was the wicked stepmother was terrifying! How could kids sit and like this movie without covering their eyes and crying? Just how? I would avoid this movie at any cost-- unless you're just curious at Disney's attempt at this abomination,

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a significant piece of American film history for many reasons, chief among them being that it was the first full-length animated feature ever made. This film was also responsible for influencing other landmark fantasy/sci-fi flicks such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Star Wars (1977), and the gratitude from critics and audiences alike for its existence will not cease for quite some time. That being said, does Walt Disney's 1937 animated landmark film hold up as a piece of cinema today aside from its importance and our memories of watching it as a kid? My answer to that question is yes. I think it's safe to say that most of us know the story to this one. An evil queen has learned from her magic mirror that her stepdaughter Snow White is considered "the fairest one of all" and this causes the queen to be jealous. She becomes so jealous in fact that she sends out her loyal huntsman to kill her stepdaughter. But the huntsman is unable to pull off this task and orders Snow White to run away and never come back. Lost, confused, and alone, she finds a cottage in the woods which is occupied by seven little dwarfs where she seeks shelter and protection from the queen's evil plans. The story behind the making of this picture is simply amazing. The production of this movie lasted for 4 &frac12; years and during that production, many complications aroused. From the seemingly endless increase in the production's costs to the skepticism from everybody (including Disney's growing staff of animators) regarding whether or not anyone will watch a feature length cartoon (mainly because many feared that the film would run out of gags or the colors would be too bright). If that didn't sound dramatic enough yet for whatever reason, they didn't settle on the names of the dwarfs until under a year before the film came out and the film itself was completed 2 &frac12; weeks before its release (imagine the amount of work they had to do with the advertising and whatnot). Just hearing what I just said alone, it's miraculous that the film did outstanding financially and critically. Otherwise, the Disney studios would have probably gone out of business due to the film's costs. It really is an amazing success story and is sure to give those who currently resent the Disney Company's ways a better respect for what Walt Disney himself had accomplished. As for the quality of the film itself, it still holds up pretty well. The animation is still as breathtaking and impressively detailed as it was in 1937. It's all the more outstanding if you look at the landmark black-and-white Mickey Mouse short, Steamboat Willie (1928) and look at the very basic animation used in that short and then look at the more realistic animation in this film. By doing that, you can obtain a much deeper appreciation of just how far the animation studio had come during that era. The progress that studio made from Steamboat Willie to Snow White is unbelievable. It truly does have to be seen to be believed. The music from Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Paul Smith is filled with songs we all know and love from "Heigh Ho" to "Someday My Prince Will Come". Even though Snow White's singing voice may be a little too much for some tastes, the songs still have nice lyrics and a terrific melody to them. The background musical score is simply wonderful from beginning to end. It really gives this landmark achievement in filmmaking the epic scope and memorability that it rightfully deserves. Ever since this film, most of Disney's animated features have been musicals and one could easily say that Snow White started a great tradition. It further explains why animation and music are practically peanut butter and jelly in the film industry. The characters in this movie that hold up the best are easily the seven dwarfs. Nowadays, I feel like I talk similarly to the way Doc talks in this feature in that he mixes up his words more than a couple times but still makes wise decisions. I think we all know someone in our own personal lives who acts like Grumpy. As for Dopey, he rightfully deserves comparison with the great pantomime clowns like Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. The storytellers did a great job at bringing the personalities of the dwarfs to life. Snow White and the prince himself are a little underdeveloped character wise, but to be fair, it was difficult drawing these characters around the time this film came out. If it wasn't for the existence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, we probably still wouldn't know what kind of films to make for our kids, and we probably wouldn't have much in the way of either animated films or sci-fi/fantasy films. Many of us including myself will be forever grateful for what Walt Disney and his staff of animators have accomplished with this film. It was a terrific film to see during my childhood and it was worthy revisiting it as a young adult and appreciating it as a giant landmark in the history of American filmmaking.

    How do you even review a movie that you grew up with, without being fully nostalgic? Without having a bias towards it because you know it so well? I don't think you can, which is partly why I love this movie. It's completely wonderful and charming, but the fact that it brings up such nostalgic feelings, and I can recite every line, make it nearly perfect. The evil queen is so, well, evil! She is so evil, she is willing to make herself the ugliest old hag around in order to kill poor, sweet Snow White! Snow White, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most gentle young girl (she is only 14, you know). She wouldn't hurt a fly! And, of course, the dwarfs are the humor in the story. Grumpy is my favorite! All in all, this movie is truly a 10. Walt Disney was an absolute genius!

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether. The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her. Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White. The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright. The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like "Heigh Ho", and "Someday My Prince Will Come" add more depth into our characters and the story. Perfect If you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason

    There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure. Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine. As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha. The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith. Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the "Whistle While You Work", "Heigh-Ho", "I'm wishing" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one. The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.

    Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house. The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White. Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple. It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com

    A movie milestone, a legend that started the beauty and majesty that is Disney. A revolutionary film, unlike any other before it and a movie that has managed to endure the test of time. As you can see, I absolutely love this film. It was the first film I was given as a gift when I was a child, and thus it was the first film that I ever owned. It wasn't the first film I ever saw, at least I don't think it was, but it was the first Disney film of my life, and it left a lasting impression. I was pretty much hooked from the very first scene, and why wouldn't I be. The Disney company got a lot of things right, even if none of them had ever done anything like this before, and you can recognize many of their future trademarks in this film. The complexity of the backgrounds, the fairytale morality and good's triumph over evil, the grace and beauty of movement, the masterful use of music to tell a story and to enhance the mood during otherwise silent scenes, the colourful characters... they're all there. Not to say that the film's age doesn't show in certain scenes and aspects of the story. For example, the plot, while good and captivating, is a bit simplistic and in the end the conflict is solved rather easily. The characters, and especially the queen, have a tendency to speak directly towards the "camera", which is pretty much unheard of in modern days, but I think that in this case it actually improves the film, because it's just so unsettling when the evil queen stares right into your eyes while cackling like a madwoman. Also the songs aren't up to Disney's usual standards, though they aren't bad. They're just more simplistic and shorter than some of the legendary songs that Disney would later produce. So yeah, this is a masterpiece, absolute wonder of film making and a film that has earned its eternal place in the classics. And it's still just as good as it was back then so there's absolutely no reason not to watch it every now and then.

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a significant piece of American film history for many reasons, chief among them being that it was the first full-length animated feature ever made. This film was also responsible for influencing other landmark fantasy/sci-fi flicks such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Star Wars (1977), and the gratitude from critics and audiences alike for its existence will not cease for quite some time. That being said, does Walt Disney's 1937 animated landmark film hold up as a piece of cinema today aside from its importance and our memories of watching it as a kid? My answer to that question is yes. I think it's safe to say that most of us know the story to this one. An evil queen has learned from her magic mirror that her stepdaughter Snow White is considered "the fairest one of all" and this causes the queen to be jealous. She becomes so jealous in fact that she sends out her loyal huntsman to kill her stepdaughter. But the huntsman is unable to pull off this task and orders Snow White to run away and never come back. Lost, confused, and alone, she finds a cottage in the woods which is occupied by seven little dwarfs where she seeks shelter and protection from the queen's evil plans. The story behind the making of this picture is simply amazing. The production of this movie lasted for 4 &frac12; years and during that production, many complications aroused. From the seemingly endless increase in the production's costs to the skepticism from everybody (including Disney's growing staff of animators) regarding whether or not anyone will watch a feature length cartoon (mainly because many feared that the film would run out of gags or the colors would be too bright). If that didn't sound dramatic enough yet for whatever reason, they didn't settle on the names of the dwarfs until under a year before the film came out and the film itself was completed 2 &frac12; weeks before its release (imagine the amount of work they had to do with the advertising and whatnot). Just hearing what I just said alone, it's miraculous that the film did outstanding financially and critically. Otherwise, the Disney studios would have probably gone out of business due to the film's costs. It really is an amazing success story and is sure to give those who currently resent the Disney Company's ways a better respect for what Walt Disney himself had accomplished. As for the quality of the film itself, it still holds up pretty well. The animation is still as breathtaking and impressively detailed as it was in 1937. It's all the more outstanding if you look at the landmark black-and-white Mickey Mouse short, Steamboat Willie (1928) and look at the very basic animation used in that short and then look at the more realistic animation in this film. By doing that, you can obtain a much deeper appreciation of just how far the animation studio had come during that era. The progress that studio made from Steamboat Willie to Snow White is unbelievable. It truly does have to be seen to be believed. The music from Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Paul Smith is filled with songs we all know and love from "Heigh Ho" to "Someday My Prince Will Come". Even though Snow White's singing voice may be a little too much for some tastes, the songs still have nice lyrics and a terrific melody to them. The background musical score is simply wonderful from beginning to end. It really gives this landmark achievement in filmmaking the epic scope and memorability that it rightfully deserves. Ever since this film, most of Disney's animated features have been musicals and one could easily say that Snow White started a great tradition. It further explains why animation and music are practically peanut butter and jelly in the film industry. The characters in this movie that hold up the best are easily the seven dwarfs. Nowadays, I feel like I talk similarly to the way Doc talks in this feature in that he mixes up his words more than a couple times but still makes wise decisions. I think we all know someone in our own personal lives who acts like Grumpy. As for Dopey, he rightfully deserves comparison with the great pantomime clowns like Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. The storytellers did a great job at bringing the personalities of the dwarfs to life. Snow White and the prince himself are a little underdeveloped character wise, but to be fair, it was difficult drawing these characters around the time this film came out. If it wasn't for the existence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, we probably still wouldn't know what kind of films to make for our kids, and we probably wouldn't have much in the way of either animated films or sci-fi/fantasy films. Many of us including myself will be forever grateful for what Walt Disney and his staff of animators have accomplished with this film. It was a terrific film to see during my childhood and it was worthy revisiting it as a young adult and appreciating it as a giant landmark in the history of American filmmaking.

    How do you even review a movie that you grew up with, without being fully nostalgic? Without having a bias towards it because you know it so well? I don't think you can, which is partly why I love this movie. It's completely wonderful and charming, but the fact that it brings up such nostalgic feelings, and I can recite every line, make it nearly perfect. The evil queen is so, well, evil! She is so evil, she is willing to make herself the ugliest old hag around in order to kill poor, sweet Snow White! Snow White, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most gentle young girl (she is only 14, you know). She wouldn't hurt a fly! And, of course, the dwarfs are the humor in the story. Grumpy is my favorite! All in all, this movie is truly a 10. Walt Disney was an absolute genius!

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether. The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her. Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White. The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright. The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like "Heigh Ho", and "Someday My Prince Will Come" add more depth into our characters and the story. Perfect If you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason

    There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure. Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine. As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha. The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith. Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the "Whistle While You Work", "Heigh-Ho", "I'm wishing" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one. The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.

    Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house. The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White. Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple. It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com

    A movie milestone, a legend that started the beauty and majesty that is Disney. A revolutionary film, unlike any other before it and a movie that has managed to endure the test of time. As you can see, I absolutely love this film. It was the first film I was given as a gift when I was a child, and thus it was the first film that I ever owned. It wasn't the first film I ever saw, at least I don't think it was, but it was the first Disney film of my life, and it left a lasting impression. I was pretty much hooked from the very first scene, and why wouldn't I be. The Disney company got a lot of things right, even if none of them had ever done anything like this before, and you can recognize many of their future trademarks in this film. The complexity of the backgrounds, the fairytale morality and good's triumph over evil, the grace and beauty of movement, the masterful use of music to tell a story and to enhance the mood during otherwise silent scenes, the colourful characters... they're all there. Not to say that the film's age doesn't show in certain scenes and aspects of the story. For example, the plot, while good and captivating, is a bit simplistic and in the end the conflict is solved rather easily. The characters, and especially the queen, have a tendency to speak directly towards the "camera", which is pretty much unheard of in modern days, but I think that in this case it actually improves the film, because it's just so unsettling when the evil queen stares right into your eyes while cackling like a madwoman. Also the songs aren't up to Disney's usual standards, though they aren't bad. They're just more simplistic and shorter than some of the legendary songs that Disney would later produce. So yeah, this is a masterpiece, absolute wonder of film making and a film that has earned its eternal place in the classics. And it's still just as good as it was back then so there's absolutely no reason not to watch it every now and then.

    The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman. Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse). Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are "I'm Wishing," "Whistle While You Work," "Hi Ho," and "Someday My Prince Will Come." A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying. Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.

    No one believed it would succeed. Everyone called it "Disney's Folly". And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. "Beauty and the Beast", "The Lion King", "Toy Story", and "Finding Nemo" all owe to this movie: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, "Snow White" has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. "Snow White" stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss. The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with "Heigh-ho" and "Someday my Prince will Come" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development. So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.

    dear sir,I like to read about fairy tales whether shortened or in a long form.I think animation movies are good.I think there were animation stories from kerala and from India,where I reside.I think animation stories are good for the entire family-maybe only a few get a x certificate-ie for those who are particular.I think Walt Disney was a good maker of animation movies.I think animation movies are good,I guess that there was a animation movie called gatotkatcha in Hindi which is about a character from the Indian Mahabharata-well he was the son of Bhima who was of great help in the pandavas fight against the kauravas.In the clash he died like a true hero.He had a lot of magical power-he used to dispatch weapons from heaven,though he was born someone like a ogre-i guess he fought on the virtuous side.thanks

    I'm usually generous when it comes to reviewing, I like to pick out the best parts in movies and say little about negative parts, but this, this had to be a negative review and if you're a Snow White Fan and you think it's the best Disney movie, keep scrolling. You're not going to like this. The thing that bothers me is that there's absolutely no substance to the story or the characters. I blame the time setting, 1937. Things weren't as advanced, animation is impressive but that's it. Walt Disney didn't really give personality to the characters, develop the story line. He just thought: damsel in distress, wicked and evil stepmother and handsome prince to rescue the damsel. End of story. Also, there was a poor shot at trying to make the screen time with the dwarfs funny, they were as annoying as Snow White. All seven were named after emotions or a symptom. Very clever *rolls eyes* Now, Snow White on the other hand is utterly and completely sugary sweet. Her voice makes me want to hit her, the way she flounces about the place singing at everything. How innocent she plays out to be.. ugh. Compare that dullness to the likes of other Disney Princess's like Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas, Rapunzel etc. Then she's totally bland. In a way, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt.. they did try. Apparently if Disney's Cinderella wasn't successful, then they would've had to shut down, hence, my point. Snow White was that bad and just laughable that they were nearly out of business. Now the fans. They're obviously ass kissing. How could you like Snow White in any way? My theory is, is that they're rooting for the movie because it's Disney's first full feature length film. No offence to Walt Disney but after he died, the story lines improved and gained success and attention. The characters were more memorable, fun and the movies were a huge hit. Disney started everything, so I should be grateful because I am a huge fan but one thing's for sure is that Disney wouldn't have had a chance if it wasn't for Cinderella. In my opinion, still a very cheap and low chance at a film. Again, back to the time frame. What was it? 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960? Then Walt Disney died and movies improved? Quite suspicious to be honest. In conclusion, I hated this movie and that evil old woman who was the wicked stepmother was terrifying! How could kids sit and like this movie without covering their eyes and crying? Just how? I would avoid this movie at any cost-- unless you're just curious at Disney's attempt at this abomination,

    There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure. Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine. As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha. The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith. Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the "Whistle While You Work", "Heigh-Ho", "I'm wishing" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one. The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.

    Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house. The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White. Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple. It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com

    A movie milestone, a legend that started the beauty and majesty that is Disney. A revolutionary film, unlike any other before it and a movie that has managed to endure the test of time. As you can see, I absolutely love this film. It was the first film I was given as a gift when I was a child, and thus it was the first film that I ever owned. It wasn't the first film I ever saw, at least I don't think it was, but it was the first Disney film of my life, and it left a lasting impression. I was pretty much hooked from the very first scene, and why wouldn't I be. The Disney company got a lot of things right, even if none of them had ever done anything like this before, and you can recognize many of their future trademarks in this film. The complexity of the backgrounds, the fairytale morality and good's triumph over evil, the grace and beauty of movement, the masterful use of music to tell a story and to enhance the mood during otherwise silent scenes, the colourful characters... they're all there. Not to say that the film's age doesn't show in certain scenes and aspects of the story. For example, the plot, while good and captivating, is a bit simplistic and in the end the conflict is solved rather easily. The characters, and especially the queen, have a tendency to speak directly towards the "camera", which is pretty much unheard of in modern days, but I think that in this case it actually improves the film, because it's just so unsettling when the evil queen stares right into your eyes while cackling like a madwoman. Also the songs aren't up to Disney's usual standards, though they aren't bad. They're just more simplistic and shorter than some of the legendary songs that Disney would later produce. So yeah, this is a masterpiece, absolute wonder of film making and a film that has earned its eternal place in the classics. And it's still just as good as it was back then so there's absolutely no reason not to watch it every now and then.

    The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman. Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse). Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are "I'm Wishing," "Whistle While You Work," "Hi Ho," and "Someday My Prince Will Come." A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying. Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.

    No one believed it would succeed. Everyone called it "Disney's Folly". And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. "Beauty and the Beast", "The Lion King", "Toy Story", and "Finding Nemo" all owe to this movie: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, "Snow White" has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. "Snow White" stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss. The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with "Heigh-ho" and "Someday my Prince will Come" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development. So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.

    dear sir,I like to read about fairy tales whether shortened or in a long form.I think animation movies are good.I think there were animation stories from kerala and from India,where I reside.I think animation stories are good for the entire family-maybe only a few get a x certificate-ie for those who are particular.I think Walt Disney was a good maker of animation movies.I think animation movies are good,I guess that there was a animation movie called gatotkatcha in Hindi which is about a character from the Indian Mahabharata-well he was the son of Bhima who was of great help in the pandavas fight against the kauravas.In the clash he died like a true hero.He had a lot of magical power-he used to dispatch weapons from heaven,though he was born someone like a ogre-i guess he fought on the virtuous side.thanks

    I'm usually generous when it comes to reviewing, I like to pick out the best parts in movies and say little about negative parts, but this, this had to be a negative review and if you're a Snow White Fan and you think it's the best Disney movie, keep scrolling. You're not going to like this. The thing that bothers me is that there's absolutely no substance to the story or the characters. I blame the time setting, 1937. Things weren't as advanced, animation is impressive but that's it. Walt Disney didn't really give personality to the characters, develop the story line. He just thought: damsel in distress, wicked and evil stepmother and handsome prince to rescue the damsel. End of story. Also, there was a poor shot at trying to make the screen time with the dwarfs funny, they were as annoying as Snow White. All seven were named after emotions or a symptom. Very clever *rolls eyes* Now, Snow White on the other hand is utterly and completely sugary sweet. Her voice makes me want to hit her, the way she flounces about the place singing at everything. How innocent she plays out to be.. ugh. Compare that dullness to the likes of other Disney Princess's like Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas, Rapunzel etc. Then she's totally bland. In a way, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt.. they did try. Apparently if Disney's Cinderella wasn't successful, then they would've had to shut down, hence, my point. Snow White was that bad and just laughable that they were nearly out of business. Now the fans. They're obviously ass kissing. How could you like Snow White in any way? My theory is, is that they're rooting for the movie because it's Disney's first full feature length film. No offence to Walt Disney but after he died, the story lines improved and gained success and attention. The characters were more memorable, fun and the movies were a huge hit. Disney started everything, so I should be grateful because I am a huge fan but one thing's for sure is that Disney wouldn't have had a chance if it wasn't for Cinderella. In my opinion, still a very cheap and low chance at a film. Again, back to the time frame. What was it? 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960? Then Walt Disney died and movies improved? Quite suspicious to be honest. In conclusion, I hated this movie and that evil old woman who was the wicked stepmother was terrifying! How could kids sit and like this movie without covering their eyes and crying? Just how? I would avoid this movie at any cost-- unless you're just curious at Disney's attempt at this abomination,

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a significant piece of American film history for many reasons, chief among them being that it was the first full-length animated feature ever made. This film was also responsible for influencing other landmark fantasy/sci-fi flicks such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Star Wars (1977), and the gratitude from critics and audiences alike for its existence will not cease for quite some time. That being said, does Walt Disney's 1937 animated landmark film hold up as a piece of cinema today aside from its importance and our memories of watching it as a kid? My answer to that question is yes. I think it's safe to say that most of us know the story to this one. An evil queen has learned from her magic mirror that her stepdaughter Snow White is considered "the fairest one of all" and this causes the queen to be jealous. She becomes so jealous in fact that she sends out her loyal huntsman to kill her stepdaughter. But the huntsman is unable to pull off this task and orders Snow White to run away and never come back. Lost, confused, and alone, she finds a cottage in the woods which is occupied by seven little dwarfs where she seeks shelter and protection from the queen's evil plans. The story behind the making of this picture is simply amazing. The production of this movie lasted for 4 &frac12; years and during that production, many complications aroused. From the seemingly endless increase in the production's costs to the skepticism from everybody (including Disney's growing staff of animators) regarding whether or not anyone will watch a feature length cartoon (mainly because many feared that the film would run out of gags or the colors would be too bright). If that didn't sound dramatic enough yet for whatever reason, they didn't settle on the names of the dwarfs until under a year before the film came out and the film itself was completed 2 &frac12; weeks before its release (imagine the amount of work they had to do with the advertising and whatnot). Just hearing what I just said alone, it's miraculous that the film did outstanding financially and critically. Otherwise, the Disney studios would have probably gone out of business due to the film's costs. It really is an amazing success story and is sure to give those who currently resent the Disney Company's ways a better respect for what Walt Disney himself had accomplished. As for the quality of the film itself, it still holds up pretty well. The animation is still as breathtaking and impressively detailed as it was in 1937. It's all the more outstanding if you look at the landmark black-and-white Mickey Mouse short, Steamboat Willie (1928) and look at the very basic animation used in that short and then look at the more realistic animation in this film. By doing that, you can obtain a much deeper appreciation of just how far the animation studio had come during that era. The progress that studio made from Steamboat Willie to Snow White is unbelievable. It truly does have to be seen to be believed. The music from Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Paul Smith is filled with songs we all know and love from "Heigh Ho" to "Someday My Prince Will Come". Even though Snow White's singing voice may be a little too much for some tastes, the songs still have nice lyrics and a terrific melody to them. The background musical score is simply wonderful from beginning to end. It really gives this landmark achievement in filmmaking the epic scope and memorability that it rightfully deserves. Ever since this film, most of Disney's animated features have been musicals and one could easily say that Snow White started a great tradition. It further explains why animation and music are practically peanut butter and jelly in the film industry. The characters in this movie that hold up the best are easily the seven dwarfs. Nowadays, I feel like I talk similarly to the way Doc talks in this feature in that he mixes up his words more than a couple times but still makes wise decisions. I think we all know someone in our own personal lives who acts like Grumpy. As for Dopey, he rightfully deserves comparison with the great pantomime clowns like Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. The storytellers did a great job at bringing the personalities of the dwarfs to life. Snow White and the prince himself are a little underdeveloped character wise, but to be fair, it was difficult drawing these characters around the time this film came out. If it wasn't for the existence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, we probably still wouldn't know what kind of films to make for our kids, and we probably wouldn't have much in the way of either animated films or sci-fi/fantasy films. Many of us including myself will be forever grateful for what Walt Disney and his staff of animators have accomplished with this film. It was a terrific film to see during my childhood and it was worthy revisiting it as a young adult and appreciating it as a giant landmark in the history of American filmmaking.

    How do you even review a movie that you grew up with, without being fully nostalgic? Without having a bias towards it because you know it so well? I don't think you can, which is partly why I love this movie. It's completely wonderful and charming, but the fact that it brings up such nostalgic feelings, and I can recite every line, make it nearly perfect. The evil queen is so, well, evil! She is so evil, she is willing to make herself the ugliest old hag around in order to kill poor, sweet Snow White! Snow White, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most gentle young girl (she is only 14, you know). She wouldn't hurt a fly! And, of course, the dwarfs are the humor in the story. Grumpy is my favorite! All in all, this movie is truly a 10. Walt Disney was an absolute genius!

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether. The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her. Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White. The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright. The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like "Heigh Ho", and "Someday My Prince Will Come" add more depth into our characters and the story. Perfect If you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason

Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse). Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are "I'm Wishing," "Whistle While You Work," "Hi Ho," and "Someday My Prince Will Come." A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying. Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.

    No one believed it would succeed. Everyone called it "Disney's Folly". And yet, it was a giant money maker, grossing over $8 million, established its creator as a master filmmaker, and created a genre, changing history forever. "Beauty and the Beast", "The Lion King", "Toy Story", and "Finding Nemo" all owe to this movie: "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". Released in 1937 and re-released in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 (50th anniversary), and 1993, "Snow White" has charmed audiences for decades. But is it the classic everyone hails it as? Yes, it is. "Snow White" stands out as one of the best films in the Disney canon. We all know the story, so I'm not going to write it all out, just use IMDb's synopsis: Snow White, pursued by a jealous queen, hides with the Dwarfs; the queen feeds her a poison apple, but Prince Charming awakens her with a kiss. The animation in the film is gorgeous, even by today's standard (save the Huntsman and the Prince, they look somewhat odd). Snow White genuinely looks like a young girl, and the Queen looks like a real woman. The way the Dwarfs are drawn is enjoyable, and so are the characters. Snow White is kind, cheerful, good with animals, and has a good personality (not to mention the fact she became a mother to the Seven Dwarfs - a tough job). The Dwarfs are all memorable and lovable, with Grumpy and Dopey being the most liked. The Queen is a great villain. Her drive to kill a young girl so she can be the most beautiful, which makes her go insane is incredibly disturbing and creepy, and the way she looks as the Witch is great. The film's music and songs are also perfect and memorable, with "Heigh-ho" and "Someday my Prince will Come" as the standouts. This is also perfectly paced, with sweet moments, scary moments, and time for character development. So, what else can I say? Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, perfect music, and a brilliantly constructed plot. A true cinematic masterpiece not to be missed.

    dear sir,I like to read about fairy tales whether shortened or in a long form.I think animation movies are good.I think there were animation stories from kerala and from India,where I reside.I think animation stories are good for the entire family-maybe only a few get a x certificate-ie for those who are particular.I think Walt Disney was a good maker of animation movies.I think animation movies are good,I guess that there was a animation movie called gatotkatcha in Hindi which is about a character from the Indian Mahabharata-well he was the son of Bhima who was of great help in the pandavas fight against the kauravas.In the clash he died like a true hero.He had a lot of magical power-he used to dispatch weapons from heaven,though he was born someone like a ogre-i guess he fought on the virtuous side.thanks

    I'm usually generous when it comes to reviewing, I like to pick out the best parts in movies and say little about negative parts, but this, this had to be a negative review and if you're a Snow White Fan and you think it's the best Disney movie, keep scrolling. You're not going to like this. The thing that bothers me is that there's absolutely no substance to the story or the characters. I blame the time setting, 1937. Things weren't as advanced, animation is impressive but that's it. Walt Disney didn't really give personality to the characters, develop the story line. He just thought: damsel in distress, wicked and evil stepmother and handsome prince to rescue the damsel. End of story. Also, there was a poor shot at trying to make the screen time with the dwarfs funny, they were as annoying as Snow White. All seven were named after emotions or a symptom. Very clever *rolls eyes* Now, Snow White on the other hand is utterly and completely sugary sweet. Her voice makes me want to hit her, the way she flounces about the place singing at everything. How innocent she plays out to be.. ugh. Compare that dullness to the likes of other Disney Princess's like Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas, Rapunzel etc. Then she's totally bland. In a way, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt.. they did try. Apparently if Disney's Cinderella wasn't successful, then they would've had to shut down, hence, my point. Snow White was that bad and just laughable that they were nearly out of business. Now the fans. They're obviously ass kissing. How could you like Snow White in any way? My theory is, is that they're rooting for the movie because it's Disney's first full feature length film. No offence to Walt Disney but after he died, the story lines improved and gained success and attention. The characters were more memorable, fun and the movies were a huge hit. Disney started everything, so I should be grateful because I am a huge fan but one thing's for sure is that Disney wouldn't have had a chance if it wasn't for Cinderella. In my opinion, still a very cheap and low chance at a film. Again, back to the time frame. What was it? 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960? Then Walt Disney died and movies improved? Quite suspicious to be honest. In conclusion, I hated this movie and that evil old woman who was the wicked stepmother was terrifying! How could kids sit and like this movie without covering their eyes and crying? Just how? I would avoid this movie at any cost-- unless you're just curious at Disney's attempt at this abomination,

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a significant piece of American film history for many reasons, chief among them being that it was the first full-length animated feature ever made. This film was also responsible for influencing other landmark fantasy/sci-fi flicks such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Star Wars (1977), and the gratitude from critics and audiences alike for its existence will not cease for quite some time. That being said, does Walt Disney's 1937 animated landmark film hold up as a piece of cinema today aside from its importance and our memories of watching it as a kid? My answer to that question is yes. I think it's safe to say that most of us know the story to this one. An evil queen has learned from her magic mirror that her stepdaughter Snow White is considered "the fairest one of all" and this causes the queen to be jealous. She becomes so jealous in fact that she sends out her loyal huntsman to kill her stepdaughter. But the huntsman is unable to pull off this task and orders Snow White to run away and never come back. Lost, confused, and alone, she finds a cottage in the woods which is occupied by seven little dwarfs where she seeks shelter and protection from the queen's evil plans. The story behind the making of this picture is simply amazing. The production of this movie lasted for 4 &frac12; years and during that production, many complications aroused. From the seemingly endless increase in the production's costs to the skepticism from everybody (including Disney's growing staff of animators) regarding whether or not anyone will watch a feature length cartoon (mainly because many feared that the film would run out of gags or the colors would be too bright). If that didn't sound dramatic enough yet for whatever reason, they didn't settle on the names of the dwarfs until under a year before the film came out and the film itself was completed 2 &frac12; weeks before its release (imagine the amount of work they had to do with the advertising and whatnot). Just hearing what I just said alone, it's miraculous that the film did outstanding financially and critically. Otherwise, the Disney studios would have probably gone out of business due to the film's costs. It really is an amazing success story and is sure to give those who currently resent the Disney Company's ways a better respect for what Walt Disney himself had accomplished. As for the quality of the film itself, it still holds up pretty well. The animation is still as breathtaking and impressively detailed as it was in 1937. It's all the more outstanding if you look at the landmark black-and-white Mickey Mouse short, Steamboat Willie (1928) and look at the very basic animation used in that short and then look at the more realistic animation in this film. By doing that, you can obtain a much deeper appreciation of just how far the animation studio had come during that era. The progress that studio made from Steamboat Willie to Snow White is unbelievable. It truly does have to be seen to be believed. The music from Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Paul Smith is filled with songs we all know and love from "Heigh Ho" to "Someday My Prince Will Come". Even though Snow White's singing voice may be a little too much for some tastes, the songs still have nice lyrics and a terrific melody to them. The background musical score is simply wonderful from beginning to end. It really gives this landmark achievement in filmmaking the epic scope and memorability that it rightfully deserves. Ever since this film, most of Disney's animated features have been musicals and one could easily say that Snow White started a great tradition. It further explains why animation and music are practically peanut butter and jelly in the film industry. The characters in this movie that hold up the best are easily the seven dwarfs. Nowadays, I feel like I talk similarly to the way Doc talks in this feature in that he mixes up his words more than a couple times but still makes wise decisions. I think we all know someone in our own personal lives who acts like Grumpy. As for Dopey, he rightfully deserves comparison with the great pantomime clowns like Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. The storytellers did a great job at bringing the personalities of the dwarfs to life. Snow White and the prince himself are a little underdeveloped character wise, but to be fair, it was difficult drawing these characters around the time this film came out. If it wasn't for the existence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, we probably still wouldn't know what kind of films to make for our kids, and we probably wouldn't have much in the way of either animated films or sci-fi/fantasy films. Many of us including myself will be forever grateful for what Walt Disney and his staff of animators have accomplished with this film. It was a terrific film to see during my childhood and it was worthy revisiting it as a young adult and appreciating it as a giant landmark in the history of American filmmaking.

    How do you even review a movie that you grew up with, without being fully nostalgic? Without having a bias towards it because you know it so well? I don't think you can, which is partly why I love this movie. It's completely wonderful and charming, but the fact that it brings up such nostalgic feelings, and I can recite every line, make it nearly perfect. The evil queen is so, well, evil! She is so evil, she is willing to make herself the ugliest old hag around in order to kill poor, sweet Snow White! Snow White, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most gentle young girl (she is only 14, you know). She wouldn't hurt a fly! And, of course, the dwarfs are the humor in the story. Grumpy is my favorite! All in all, this movie is truly a 10. Walt Disney was an absolute genius!

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether. The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her. Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White. The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright. The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like "Heigh Ho", and "Someday My Prince Will Come" add more depth into our characters and the story. Perfect If you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason

    There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure. Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine. As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha. The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith. Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the "Whistle While You Work", "Heigh-Ho", "I'm wishing" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one. The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.

    Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house. The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White. Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple. It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com

    A movie milestone, a legend that started the beauty and majesty that is Disney. A revolutionary film, unlike any other before it and a movie that has managed to endure the test of time. As you can see, I absolutely love this film. It was the first film I was given as a gift when I was a child, and thus it was the first film that I ever owned. It wasn't the first film I ever saw, at least I don't think it was, but it was the first Disney film of my life, and it left a lasting impression. I was pretty much hooked from the very first scene, and why wouldn't I be. The Disney company got a lot of things right, even if none of them had ever done anything like this before, and you can recognize many of their future trademarks in this film. The complexity of the backgrounds, the fairytale morality and good's triumph over evil, the grace and beauty of movement, the masterful use of music to tell a story and to enhance the mood during otherwise silent scenes, the colourful characters... they're all there. Not to say that the film's age doesn't show in certain scenes and aspects of the story. For example, the plot, while good and captivating, is a bit simplistic and in the end the conflict is solved rather easily. The characters, and especially the queen, have a tendency to speak directly towards the "camera", which is pretty much unheard of in modern days, but I think that in this case it actually improves the film, because it's just so unsettling when the evil queen stares right into your eyes while cackling like a madwoman. Also the songs aren't up to Disney's usual standards, though they aren't bad. They're just more simplistic and shorter than some of the legendary songs that Disney would later produce. So yeah, this is a masterpiece, absolute wonder of film making and a film that has earned its eternal place in the classics. And it's still just as good as it was back then so there's absolutely no reason not to watch it every now and then.

    The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman. Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse). Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are "I'm Wishing," "Whistle While You Work," "Hi Ho," and "Someday My Prince Will Come." A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying. Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.

That being said, does Walt Disney's 1937 animated landmark film hold up as a piece of cinema today aside from its importance and our memories of watching it as a kid? My answer to that question is yes. I think it's safe to say that most of us know the story to this one. An evil queen has learned from her magic mirror that her stepdaughter Snow White is considered "the fairest one of all" and this causes the queen to be jealous. She becomes so jealous in fact that she sends out her loyal huntsman to kill her stepdaughter. But the huntsman is unable to pull off this task and orders Snow White to run away and never come back. Lost, confused, and alone, she finds a cottage in the woods which is occupied by seven little dwarfs where she seeks shelter and protection from the queen's evil plans. The story behind the making of this picture is simply amazing. The production of this movie lasted for 4 &frac12; years and during that production, many complications aroused. From the seemingly endless increase in the production's costs to the skepticism from everybody (including Disney's growing staff of animators) regarding whether or not anyone will watch a feature length cartoon (mainly because many feared that the film would run out of gags or the colors would be too bright). If that didn't sound dramatic enough yet for whatever reason, they didn't settle on the names of the dwarfs until under a year before the film came out and the film itself was completed 2 &frac12; weeks before its release (imagine the amount of work they had to do with the advertising and whatnot). Just hearing what I just said alone, it's miraculous that the film did outstanding financially and critically. Otherwise, the Disney studios would have probably gone out of business due to the film's costs. It really is an amazing success story and is sure to give those who currently resent the Disney Company's ways a better respect for what Walt Disney himself had accomplished. As for the quality of the film itself, it still holds up pretty well. The animation is still as breathtaking and impressively detailed as it was in 1937. It's all the more outstanding if you look at the landmark black-and-white Mickey Mouse short, Steamboat Willie (1928) and look at the very basic animation used in that short and then look at the more realistic animation in this film. By doing that, you can obtain a much deeper appreciation of just how far the animation studio had come during that era. The progress that studio made from Steamboat Willie to Snow White is unbelievable. It truly does have to be seen to be believed. The music from Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Paul Smith is filled with songs we all know and love from "Heigh Ho" to "Someday My Prince Will Come". Even though Snow White's singing voice may be a little too much for some tastes, the songs still have nice lyrics and a terrific melody to them. The background musical score is simply wonderful from beginning to end. It really gives this landmark achievement in filmmaking the epic scope and memorability that it rightfully deserves. Ever since this film, most of Disney's animated features have been musicals and one could easily say that Snow White started a great tradition. It further explains why animation and music are practically peanut butter and jelly in the film industry. The characters in this movie that hold up the best are easily the seven dwarfs. Nowadays, I feel like I talk similarly to the way Doc talks in this feature in that he mixes up his words more than a couple times but still makes wise decisions. I think we all know someone in our own personal lives who acts like Grumpy. As for Dopey, he rightfully deserves comparison with the great pantomime clowns like Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. The storytellers did a great job at bringing the personalities of the dwarfs to life. Snow White and the prince himself are a little underdeveloped character wise, but to be fair, it was difficult drawing these characters around the time this film came out. If it wasn't for the existence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, we probably still wouldn't know what kind of films to make for our kids, and we probably wouldn't have much in the way of either animated films or sci-fi/fantasy films. Many of us including myself will be forever grateful for what Walt Disney and his staff of animators have accomplished with this film. It was a terrific film to see during my childhood and it was worthy revisiting it as a young adult and appreciating it as a giant landmark in the history of American filmmaking.

    How do you even review a movie that you grew up with, without being fully nostalgic? Without having a bias towards it because you know it so well? I don't think you can, which is partly why I love this movie. It's completely wonderful and charming, but the fact that it brings up such nostalgic feelings, and I can recite every line, make it nearly perfect. The evil queen is so, well, evil! She is so evil, she is willing to make herself the ugliest old hag around in order to kill poor, sweet Snow White! Snow White, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most gentle young girl (she is only 14, you know). She wouldn't hurt a fly! And, of course, the dwarfs are the humor in the story. Grumpy is my favorite! All in all, this movie is truly a 10. Walt Disney was an absolute genius!

    Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the first Disney film, and the first animated film altogether. The story is about a young teenager named Snow White who flees into the woods, and stumbles upon a cottage with 7 dwarfs, because her wicked stepmother is after her to kill her. Even though this film was made back in the 1930s, it still holds up today. The characters are all intriguing (except the Prince), and you are rooting for the good guys. Snow White is a sweet, naive protagonist and even though she is not the most active Disney Princess, you want her to get her happy ending. The Dwarfs each have their own unique, and funny personality, and they are clearly the most interesting characters of the film. Queen Grimhilde is just so bitter and ruthless, and she does her job as a villain extremely well. You don't see much of the Prince, but he is an alright guy, and is good for Snow White. The animation is pretty good for the time it was made in, but it does have a few inconsistencies, like the movement of the characters, but it was the first animated feature, so it's alright. The story is pretty close to the Fairy Tale book, and is dedicated to that. There is no problem with the plot at all, but the filler scenes are a bit too long. All of the films in Walt's era has filler in it and that is alright, but in this film, it is a bit too long and some drag o. longer than its welcome. The songs are brilliant and bring you up. Th classic songs like "Heigh Ho", and "Someday My Prince Will Come" add more depth into our characters and the story. Perfect If you are on a nostalgic trip, and/or want entertainment for children, this film is perfect. It is iconic for a reason

    There are just some things you just can't beat and Disney's version of Snow White still can hold its own to many other animated fairy tale films that are being put out today. In this animated feature film, there is absolutely nothing that any viewer can't adore. The main premise of Snow White is still the same; the queen wants her dead and she wishes to be the fairest of them all. But in Disney's first ever to be released film, there are a few other added ideas to the story that make it a true Disney treasure. Let's begin with the characters first. Adriana Caselotti plays the voice of Snow White. Caselotti's voice, when it is either singing or just talking, is wholesomely beautiful, sweet and cute and matches the way her character is drawn quite nicely. It is by far, one of the most amiable voices a viewer could hear. As for the Queen/Witch who tries to have Snow White killed, is voiced by Lucille La Verne. She too makes her character very memorable. Her cackle as the witch sent chills up my spine. As Snow White flees from the Queen she also befriends a large amount of the forest animals; which all have the ability to some how understand her. But I really don't care because it is just as amazing to watch this movie now as it was for the viewers of 1937. But the supporting characters that everyone loves and remembers the most are the seven dwarfs voiced by multiple radio sensations of the time. And the great thing is, every fan has seven dwarfs to pick from to be the one they cherish the most. My favorite is bashful, just for being...well bashful. Tying his beard into knots and such. What a goofball hahahaha. The other two great elements in this picture are the musical numbers and the animation. Whatever made the animation the way it was for its time, is truly something. I can't put my finger on it, but the animation is made in a way that not many other films were made in this category. This is probably due to the technology of the time. But none the less, this creates a nostalgic feel to the film. The same goes for the background music composed by Paul L. Smith. Finally, along with Smith's score, are the musical numbers the characters perform. If it's the "Whistle While You Work", "Heigh-Ho", "I'm wishing" or any other song I can think of, all have really fun tunes and leave a lasting impression. Plus, they are fun to join in and sing along with as well. A very interactive film for its time and did wonders for Walt Disney's business. You just can't beat a classic like this one. The Disney version of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale is colorful in animation, as are its musical numbers and lively characters. A true sense in the word classic.

    Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house. The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White. Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple. It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com

    A movie milestone, a legend that started the beauty and majesty that is Disney. A revolutionary film, unlike any other before it and a movie that has managed to endure the test of time. As you can see, I absolutely love this film. It was the first film I was given as a gift when I was a child, and thus it was the first film that I ever owned. It wasn't the first film I ever saw, at least I don't think it was, but it was the first Disney film of my life, and it left a lasting impression. I was pretty much hooked from the very first scene, and why wouldn't I be. The Disney company got a lot of things right, even if none of them had ever done anything like this before, and you can recognize many of their future trademarks in this film. The complexity of the backgrounds, the fairytale morality and good's triumph over evil, the grace and beauty of movement, the masterful use of music to tell a story and to enhance the mood during otherwise silent scenes, the colourful characters... they're all there. Not to say that the film's age doesn't show in certain scenes and aspects of the story. For example, the plot, while good and captivating, is a bit simplistic and in the end the conflict is solved rather easily. The characters, and especially the queen, have a tendency to speak directly towards the "camera", which is pretty much unheard of in modern days, but I think that in this case it actually improves the film, because it's just so unsettling when the evil queen stares right into your eyes while cackling like a madwoman. Also the songs aren't up to Disney's usual standards, though they aren't bad. They're just more simplistic and shorter than some of the legendary songs that Disney would later produce. So yeah, this is a masterpiece, absolute wonder of film making and a film that has earned its eternal place in the classics. And it's still just as good as it was back then so there's absolutely no reason not to watch it every now and then.

    The classic Snow White story still lives to be an all-time favorite for children young and old. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family with lots of humor, romance, and laughter. This story is told through classic characters. For a full-feature movie, there really aren't that many characters. Besides Snow White and the Seven dwarfs (Doc, Happy, Sneezy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, and Sleepy); the only other characters were the Wicked Witch, the mirror (surprisingly having a personality of it's own), the prince and the Woodsman. Like any good Disney movie, it's filled with lots of animals who behave more like people: Birds (Doves, Raven, Vultures, owl, etc.), bats, alligators, rabbits, squirrels, deer, raccoons, chipmunks, butterflies, rats; there is even a mouse, fly, and horse). Of course, there are songs in good Disney movies as well. Famous songs from this movie are "I'm Wishing," "Whistle While You Work," "Hi Ho," and "Someday My Prince Will Come." A couple negatives in this movie: I wasn't partically too keen on the Prince. Snow White's voice was a bit annoying. Some parents may want to be cautious of the Wicked Queen's scene. She mixes a potion and casts a spell. There are skeletons and skulls that were obviously human at one time.
