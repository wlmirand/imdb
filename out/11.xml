 <sinopse>
  Two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A film about two homicide detectives' desperate hunt for a serial killer who justifies his crimes as absolution for the world's ignorance of the Seven Deadly Sins. The movie takes us from the tortured remains of one victim to the next as the sociopathic "John Doe" sermonizes to Detectives Sommerset and Mills -- one sin at a time. The sin of Gluttony comes first and the murderer's terrible capacity is graphically demonstrated in the dark and subdued tones characteristic of film noir. The seasoned and cultured but jaded Sommerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer's modus operandi while the bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills scoffs at his efforts to get inside the mind of a killer...

    IMO this is David Finchers best film. Fight Club was good. The Game was interesting, but this overshadows them all. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives who are after a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Brad Pitt actually acts in this film, Morgan Freeman is awesome as always, but Kevin Spacey delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen. This film had me gripped from start to finish, however it is the last 30 minutes of the film that made this so special. Never before or since I watched this film have I ever been so engrossed in a film than I was in the last 30 minutes of Se7en. 10/10. Superb.

    Only the mind of David Fincher could create this dark portrait of a series of murders that is based on the seven deadly sins. Thrown into the fray are two detectives so vastly different from each other, but must work together to solve the grisly murders. The rational Detective Somerset, played stoically by Morgan Freeman, is on the verge of retiring, but is forced against his will to stay an additional week as the murder spree begins. His partner is the volatile and frustrated Detective David Mills, a role that suits Brad Pitt just right, determined to solve his first big city case, much to the chagrin of his wife, Tracy (Gwenyth Paltrow) and to the caring frustration of Somerset. The murder scenes are grisly and not for the faint of heart. Luckily for the sake of the viewer, the "Lust" murder victim is not shown at all. However the other scenes that are shown are graphic, though not too explicit. If you;be got the stomach for it, check out "Se7en"

    the perfect word - it is a pure gem. but this film is out of words. dark pieces, one by one as bones and muscles and flesh for a story about partnership, family, desires and sin. a thriller, of course, but little far by genre. because it is a profound social analysis. because it is not only result of a beautiful script but , in same measure, it is demonstration of high performance. each actor gives to his character more than his image and art and science to imagine words sound, gesture force but himself at whole. the measure is key. and the fantastic end who represents more than top of a thriller, crime or usual movie. must see it ! it is not a bad idea to see it , again, after a couple of time. because it remains, again and again, that kind of movie out of synopsis or words of a review.

    I am an avid lover of horror and crime mysteries. Ihave tried to watch all the leading crime movies on the IMDb 250 list. Se7en has made me weak in my knees. The se7en sins of man allows a person to take 7 lives and Kevin Spacey, does that without an iota of guilt. He kills mercilessly and his kills are no less than the worst nightmare on a repeat. You are expecting that after he is arrested by the police, his motives will be clear. However, after his arrest. the only thing that is clear is his mental instability. A learned man becomes a preacher of sins and how to end them. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have acted beautifully.

    Se7en (David Fincher, 1995) Here's a movie I last saw about 15 years ago, yet my memories of it are vivid and intense. Watching it again this weekend brought all that back. Morgan Freeman is great as the retiring detective who contrasts Brad Pitt's character excellently. Se7en starts off as this sort of typical police procedural that would not be out of place in a Law and Order episode, but it sure as hell doesn't stay that way. Gwyneth Paltrow's character is given little depth, which may be a flaw but I haven't decided yet. The various fates of the victims are psychologically terrifying. To say much more would spoil the final scenes. Generally I can take or leave the whole crime/horror genre--it just isn't always my cup of tea--but this film is deeper and more raw than most. 8/10

    There are very few horror movies that have come out in the past twenty-five years that manage to deliver on the "horror" front without resorting to taking the gore over the top, or playing all of the lowest common denominator cards. Se7en is the exception to the rule. It's most bone chilling moments are dialogue driven, and plot progression is what packs the punches, not formulaically placed "one-up" death sequences. The story is personable (which is one of the best ways to increase the thrill factor), it's production is exemplary, and it's message is deep-cutting. An ace on all fronts. Movies like Se7en are a rare commodity these days. There are too many variables in on the production side to allow for "perfect 10" results upon release. But it's possible that this is what allows movies of a higher caliber have a greater impact. There is a sense of victory that gets mixed in with the stew of other pleasing emotions that movies like this evoke. Victory over the variables. Se7en is definitely one of the survivors. Despite the odds, Se7en is a perfect 10.

    "Se7en" is a movie which has to do with a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as method of doing these crimes. In this movie we have the outstanding interpretations of the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills, Morgan Freeman as Detective Lt. William Somerset and Brad Pitt as Detective David Mills. This is a must see movie because it's a movie that it will keep you hooked and you will really love it. When I saw this movie for the first time I had reservations of this film, but when it finished I thought that it worth every second of it. David Fincher did a great job in the direction of this film and that was pointed with the resonance in which had this movie and how people accepted and then loved this movie. David Fincher did a great start with "Se7en" and gave us a taste for the future films that followed and that will follow.

    A thrilling and shocking film. It's captivating with a genius story line. I can't imagine how anyone could dislike it, no matter what genres you prefer. It's really one of my favorites. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys watching crime and mystery. And of course, the amazing actors who are perfect for their roles played in the movie. One of their best performances to date, in my opinion. I'd almost compare it to The Silence of the Lambs, because of it's dark events and shocking outcomes. This films also a psychological thriller and leaves you thinking once it's over. If you've yet to check it out, you should do so right away. I give it a ten out of ten, mainly because of the creepy setting and very original plot.

    Absolutely stunning film! This film serves as what a true suspenseful thriller should be. There are a lot of crap films out there and its nice to see a rare film that is Oscar worthy. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey carry this film strongly. Of course Brad Pitt is very good too and so is the small part that Gwen Paltrow plays. I swear everything this film does you have never seen done before. Blows your mind all the new twists and turns. If you want originality and scares this film is for you. Not much else to say

    A wonderful thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat The Film Seven was written and directed by David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker. This film stars Brad Pitt (Detective David Mills), Morgan Freeman (Detective Lt. William Somerset), and Gwyneth Paltrow (Tracy Mills, David's wife). David is the new detective in town and going to be taking Somerset's place in the department. They start as partners and take on Somerset's last case. It started as a murder case, thinking this was just the ordinary case they soon find out otherwise when they come across another murder. Putting the pieces together they realize that these murders are related. There is a killer on the loose who is killing people based on the seven sins: Sloth, greed, gluttony, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Through most of the film it is raining or night time which helps to build the suspense of the movie. I think if the director would have had more day time shots the film would not have been the same. This film was outstanding and I would highly recommend that you rent it and see for yourselves.

The story is personable (which is one of the best ways to increase the thrill factor), it's production is exemplary, and it's message is deep-cutting. An ace on all fronts. Movies like Se7en are a rare commodity these days. There are too many variables in on the production side to allow for "perfect 10" results upon release. But it's possible that this is what allows movies of a higher caliber have a greater impact. There is a sense of victory that gets mixed in with the stew of other pleasing emotions that movies like this evoke. Victory over the variables. Se7en is definitely one of the survivors. Despite the odds, Se7en is a perfect 10.

    "Se7en" is a movie which has to do with a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as method of doing these crimes. In this movie we have the outstanding interpretations of the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills, Morgan Freeman as Detective Lt. William Somerset and Brad Pitt as Detective David Mills. This is a must see movie because it's a movie that it will keep you hooked and you will really love it. When I saw this movie for the first time I had reservations of this film, but when it finished I thought that it worth every second of it. David Fincher did a great job in the direction of this film and that was pointed with the resonance in which had this movie and how people accepted and then loved this movie. David Fincher did a great start with "Se7en" and gave us a taste for the future films that followed and that will follow.

    A thrilling and shocking film. It's captivating with a genius story line. I can't imagine how anyone could dislike it, no matter what genres you prefer. It's really one of my favorites. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys watching crime and mystery. And of course, the amazing actors who are perfect for their roles played in the movie. One of their best performances to date, in my opinion. I'd almost compare it to The Silence of the Lambs, because of it's dark events and shocking outcomes. This films also a psychological thriller and leaves you thinking once it's over. If you've yet to check it out, you should do so right away. I give it a ten out of ten, mainly because of the creepy setting and very original plot.

    Absolutely stunning film! This film serves as what a true suspenseful thriller should be. There are a lot of crap films out there and its nice to see a rare film that is Oscar worthy. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey carry this film strongly. Of course Brad Pitt is very good too and so is the small part that Gwen Paltrow plays. I swear everything this film does you have never seen done before. Blows your mind all the new twists and turns. If you want originality and scares this film is for you. Not much else to say

    A wonderful thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat The Film Seven was written and directed by David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker. This film stars Brad Pitt (Detective David Mills), Morgan Freeman (Detective Lt. William Somerset), and Gwyneth Paltrow (Tracy Mills, David's wife). David is the new detective in town and going to be taking Somerset's place in the department. They start as partners and take on Somerset's last case. It started as a murder case, thinking this was just the ordinary case they soon find out otherwise when they come across another murder. Putting the pieces together they realize that these murders are related. There is a killer on the loose who is killing people based on the seven sins: Sloth, greed, gluttony, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Through most of the film it is raining or night time which helps to build the suspense of the movie. I think if the director would have had more day time shots the film would not have been the same. This film was outstanding and I would highly recommend that you rent it and see for yourselves.

    IMO this is David Finchers best film. Fight Club was good. The Game was interesting, but this overshadows them all. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives who are after a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Brad Pitt actually acts in this film, Morgan Freeman is awesome as always, but Kevin Spacey delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen. This film had me gripped from start to finish, however it is the last 30 minutes of the film that made this so special. Never before or since I watched this film have I ever been so engrossed in a film than I was in the last 30 minutes of Se7en. 10/10. Superb.

    Only the mind of David Fincher could create this dark portrait of a series of murders that is based on the seven deadly sins. Thrown into the fray are two detectives so vastly different from each other, but must work together to solve the grisly murders. The rational Detective Somerset, played stoically by Morgan Freeman, is on the verge of retiring, but is forced against his will to stay an additional week as the murder spree begins. His partner is the volatile and frustrated Detective David Mills, a role that suits Brad Pitt just right, determined to solve his first big city case, much to the chagrin of his wife, Tracy (Gwenyth Paltrow) and to the caring frustration of Somerset. The murder scenes are grisly and not for the faint of heart. Luckily for the sake of the viewer, the "Lust" murder victim is not shown at all. However the other scenes that are shown are graphic, though not too explicit. If you;be got the stomach for it, check out "Se7en"

    the perfect word - it is a pure gem. but this film is out of words. dark pieces, one by one as bones and muscles and flesh for a story about partnership, family, desires and sin. a thriller, of course, but little far by genre. because it is a profound social analysis. because it is not only result of a beautiful script but , in same measure, it is demonstration of high performance. each actor gives to his character more than his image and art and science to imagine words sound, gesture force but himself at whole. the measure is key. and the fantastic end who represents more than top of a thriller, crime or usual movie. must see it ! it is not a bad idea to see it , again, after a couple of time. because it remains, again and again, that kind of movie out of synopsis or words of a review.

    I am an avid lover of horror and crime mysteries. Ihave tried to watch all the leading crime movies on the IMDb 250 list. Se7en has made me weak in my knees. The se7en sins of man allows a person to take 7 lives and Kevin Spacey, does that without an iota of guilt. He kills mercilessly and his kills are no less than the worst nightmare on a repeat. You are expecting that after he is arrested by the police, his motives will be clear. However, after his arrest. the only thing that is clear is his mental instability. A learned man becomes a preacher of sins and how to end them. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have acted beautifully.

    Se7en (David Fincher, 1995) Here's a movie I last saw about 15 years ago, yet my memories of it are vivid and intense. Watching it again this weekend brought all that back. Morgan Freeman is great as the retiring detective who contrasts Brad Pitt's character excellently. Se7en starts off as this sort of typical police procedural that would not be out of place in a Law and Order episode, but it sure as hell doesn't stay that way. Gwyneth Paltrow's character is given little depth, which may be a flaw but I haven't decided yet. The various fates of the victims are psychologically terrifying. To say much more would spoil the final scenes. Generally I can take or leave the whole crime/horror genre--it just isn't always my cup of tea--but this film is deeper and more raw than most. 8/10

    the perfect word - it is a pure gem. but this film is out of words. dark pieces, one by one as bones and muscles and flesh for a story about partnership, family, desires and sin. a thriller, of course, but little far by genre. because it is a profound social analysis. because it is not only result of a beautiful script but , in same measure, it is demonstration of high performance. each actor gives to his character more than his image and art and science to imagine words sound, gesture force but himself at whole. the measure is key. and the fantastic end who represents more than top of a thriller, crime or usual movie. must see it ! it is not a bad idea to see it , again, after a couple of time. because it remains, again and again, that kind of movie out of synopsis or words of a review.

    I am an avid lover of horror and crime mysteries. Ihave tried to watch all the leading crime movies on the IMDb 250 list. Se7en has made me weak in my knees. The se7en sins of man allows a person to take 7 lives and Kevin Spacey, does that without an iota of guilt. He kills mercilessly and his kills are no less than the worst nightmare on a repeat. You are expecting that after he is arrested by the police, his motives will be clear. However, after his arrest. the only thing that is clear is his mental instability. A learned man becomes a preacher of sins and how to end them. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have acted beautifully.

    Se7en (David Fincher, 1995) Here's a movie I last saw about 15 years ago, yet my memories of it are vivid and intense. Watching it again this weekend brought all that back. Morgan Freeman is great as the retiring detective who contrasts Brad Pitt's character excellently. Se7en starts off as this sort of typical police procedural that would not be out of place in a Law and Order episode, but it sure as hell doesn't stay that way. Gwyneth Paltrow's character is given little depth, which may be a flaw but I haven't decided yet. The various fates of the victims are psychologically terrifying. To say much more would spoil the final scenes. Generally I can take or leave the whole crime/horror genre--it just isn't always my cup of tea--but this film is deeper and more raw than most. 8/10

    There are very few horror movies that have come out in the past twenty-five years that manage to deliver on the "horror" front without resorting to taking the gore over the top, or playing all of the lowest common denominator cards. Se7en is the exception to the rule. It's most bone chilling moments are dialogue driven, and plot progression is what packs the punches, not formulaically placed "one-up" death sequences. The story is personable (which is one of the best ways to increase the thrill factor), it's production is exemplary, and it's message is deep-cutting. An ace on all fronts. Movies like Se7en are a rare commodity these days. There are too many variables in on the production side to allow for "perfect 10" results upon release. But it's possible that this is what allows movies of a higher caliber have a greater impact. There is a sense of victory that gets mixed in with the stew of other pleasing emotions that movies like this evoke. Victory over the variables. Se7en is definitely one of the survivors. Despite the odds, Se7en is a perfect 10.

    "Se7en" is a movie which has to do with a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as method of doing these crimes. In this movie we have the outstanding interpretations of the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills, Morgan Freeman as Detective Lt. William Somerset and Brad Pitt as Detective David Mills. This is a must see movie because it's a movie that it will keep you hooked and you will really love it. When I saw this movie for the first time I had reservations of this film, but when it finished I thought that it worth every second of it. David Fincher did a great job in the direction of this film and that was pointed with the resonance in which had this movie and how people accepted and then loved this movie. David Fincher did a great start with "Se7en" and gave us a taste for the future films that followed and that will follow.

    A thrilling and shocking film. It's captivating with a genius story line. I can't imagine how anyone could dislike it, no matter what genres you prefer. It's really one of my favorites. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys watching crime and mystery. And of course, the amazing actors who are perfect for their roles played in the movie. One of their best performances to date, in my opinion. I'd almost compare it to The Silence of the Lambs, because of it's dark events and shocking outcomes. This films also a psychological thriller and leaves you thinking once it's over. If you've yet to check it out, you should do so right away. I give it a ten out of ten, mainly because of the creepy setting and very original plot.

    Absolutely stunning film! This film serves as what a true suspenseful thriller should be. There are a lot of crap films out there and its nice to see a rare film that is Oscar worthy. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey carry this film strongly. Of course Brad Pitt is very good too and so is the small part that Gwen Paltrow plays. I swear everything this film does you have never seen done before. Blows your mind all the new twists and turns. If you want originality and scares this film is for you. Not much else to say

    A wonderful thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat The Film Seven was written and directed by David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker. This film stars Brad Pitt (Detective David Mills), Morgan Freeman (Detective Lt. William Somerset), and Gwyneth Paltrow (Tracy Mills, David's wife). David is the new detective in town and going to be taking Somerset's place in the department. They start as partners and take on Somerset's last case. It started as a murder case, thinking this was just the ordinary case they soon find out otherwise when they come across another murder. Putting the pieces together they realize that these murders are related. There is a killer on the loose who is killing people based on the seven sins: Sloth, greed, gluttony, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Through most of the film it is raining or night time which helps to build the suspense of the movie. I think if the director would have had more day time shots the film would not have been the same. This film was outstanding and I would highly recommend that you rent it and see for yourselves.

    IMO this is David Finchers best film. Fight Club was good. The Game was interesting, but this overshadows them all. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives who are after a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Brad Pitt actually acts in this film, Morgan Freeman is awesome as always, but Kevin Spacey delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen. This film had me gripped from start to finish, however it is the last 30 minutes of the film that made this so special. Never before or since I watched this film have I ever been so engrossed in a film than I was in the last 30 minutes of Se7en. 10/10. Superb.

    Only the mind of David Fincher could create this dark portrait of a series of murders that is based on the seven deadly sins. Thrown into the fray are two detectives so vastly different from each other, but must work together to solve the grisly murders. The rational Detective Somerset, played stoically by Morgan Freeman, is on the verge of retiring, but is forced against his will to stay an additional week as the murder spree begins. His partner is the volatile and frustrated Detective David Mills, a role that suits Brad Pitt just right, determined to solve his first big city case, much to the chagrin of his wife, Tracy (Gwenyth Paltrow) and to the caring frustration of Somerset. The murder scenes are grisly and not for the faint of heart. Luckily for the sake of the viewer, the "Lust" murder victim is not shown at all. However the other scenes that are shown are graphic, though not too explicit. If you;be got the stomach for it, check out "Se7en"

    IMO this is David Finchers best film. Fight Club was good. The Game was interesting, but this overshadows them all. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives who are after a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Brad Pitt actually acts in this film, Morgan Freeman is awesome as always, but Kevin Spacey delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen. This film had me gripped from start to finish, however it is the last 30 minutes of the film that made this so special. Never before or since I watched this film have I ever been so engrossed in a film than I was in the last 30 minutes of Se7en. 10/10. Superb.

    Only the mind of David Fincher could create this dark portrait of a series of murders that is based on the seven deadly sins. Thrown into the fray are two detectives so vastly different from each other, but must work together to solve the grisly murders. The rational Detective Somerset, played stoically by Morgan Freeman, is on the verge of retiring, but is forced against his will to stay an additional week as the murder spree begins. His partner is the volatile and frustrated Detective David Mills, a role that suits Brad Pitt just right, determined to solve his first big city case, much to the chagrin of his wife, Tracy (Gwenyth Paltrow) and to the caring frustration of Somerset. The murder scenes are grisly and not for the faint of heart. Luckily for the sake of the viewer, the "Lust" murder victim is not shown at all. However the other scenes that are shown are graphic, though not too explicit. If you;be got the stomach for it, check out "Se7en"

    the perfect word - it is a pure gem. but this film is out of words. dark pieces, one by one as bones and muscles and flesh for a story about partnership, family, desires and sin. a thriller, of course, but little far by genre. because it is a profound social analysis. because it is not only result of a beautiful script but , in same measure, it is demonstration of high performance. each actor gives to his character more than his image and art and science to imagine words sound, gesture force but himself at whole. the measure is key. and the fantastic end who represents more than top of a thriller, crime or usual movie. must see it ! it is not a bad idea to see it , again, after a couple of time. because it remains, again and again, that kind of movie out of synopsis or words of a review.

    I am an avid lover of horror and crime mysteries. Ihave tried to watch all the leading crime movies on the IMDb 250 list. Se7en has made me weak in my knees. The se7en sins of man allows a person to take 7 lives and Kevin Spacey, does that without an iota of guilt. He kills mercilessly and his kills are no less than the worst nightmare on a repeat. You are expecting that after he is arrested by the police, his motives will be clear. However, after his arrest. the only thing that is clear is his mental instability. A learned man becomes a preacher of sins and how to end them. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have acted beautifully.

    Se7en (David Fincher, 1995) Here's a movie I last saw about 15 years ago, yet my memories of it are vivid and intense. Watching it again this weekend brought all that back. Morgan Freeman is great as the retiring detective who contrasts Brad Pitt's character excellently. Se7en starts off as this sort of typical police procedural that would not be out of place in a Law and Order episode, but it sure as hell doesn't stay that way. Gwyneth Paltrow's character is given little depth, which may be a flaw but I haven't decided yet. The various fates of the victims are psychologically terrifying. To say much more would spoil the final scenes. Generally I can take or leave the whole crime/horror genre--it just isn't always my cup of tea--but this film is deeper and more raw than most. 8/10

    There are very few horror movies that have come out in the past twenty-five years that manage to deliver on the "horror" front without resorting to taking the gore over the top, or playing all of the lowest common denominator cards. Se7en is the exception to the rule. It's most bone chilling moments are dialogue driven, and plot progression is what packs the punches, not formulaically placed "one-up" death sequences. The story is personable (which is one of the best ways to increase the thrill factor), it's production is exemplary, and it's message is deep-cutting. An ace on all fronts. Movies like Se7en are a rare commodity these days. There are too many variables in on the production side to allow for "perfect 10" results upon release. But it's possible that this is what allows movies of a higher caliber have a greater impact. There is a sense of victory that gets mixed in with the stew of other pleasing emotions that movies like this evoke. Victory over the variables. Se7en is definitely one of the survivors. Despite the odds, Se7en is a perfect 10.

    "Se7en" is a movie which has to do with a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as method of doing these crimes. In this movie we have the outstanding interpretations of the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills, Morgan Freeman as Detective Lt. William Somerset and Brad Pitt as Detective David Mills. This is a must see movie because it's a movie that it will keep you hooked and you will really love it. When I saw this movie for the first time I had reservations of this film, but when it finished I thought that it worth every second of it. David Fincher did a great job in the direction of this film and that was pointed with the resonance in which had this movie and how people accepted and then loved this movie. David Fincher did a great start with "Se7en" and gave us a taste for the future films that followed and that will follow.

    A thrilling and shocking film. It's captivating with a genius story line. I can't imagine how anyone could dislike it, no matter what genres you prefer. It's really one of my favorites. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys watching crime and mystery. And of course, the amazing actors who are perfect for their roles played in the movie. One of their best performances to date, in my opinion. I'd almost compare it to The Silence of the Lambs, because of it's dark events and shocking outcomes. This films also a psychological thriller and leaves you thinking once it's over. If you've yet to check it out, you should do so right away. I give it a ten out of ten, mainly because of the creepy setting and very original plot.

    Absolutely stunning film! This film serves as what a true suspenseful thriller should be. There are a lot of crap films out there and its nice to see a rare film that is Oscar worthy. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey carry this film strongly. Of course Brad Pitt is very good too and so is the small part that Gwen Paltrow plays. I swear everything this film does you have never seen done before. Blows your mind all the new twists and turns. If you want originality and scares this film is for you. Not much else to say

    A wonderful thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat The Film Seven was written and directed by David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker. This film stars Brad Pitt (Detective David Mills), Morgan Freeman (Detective Lt. William Somerset), and Gwyneth Paltrow (Tracy Mills, David's wife). David is the new detective in town and going to be taking Somerset's place in the department. They start as partners and take on Somerset's last case. It started as a murder case, thinking this was just the ordinary case they soon find out otherwise when they come across another murder. Putting the pieces together they realize that these murders are related. There is a killer on the loose who is killing people based on the seven sins: Sloth, greed, gluttony, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Through most of the film it is raining or night time which helps to build the suspense of the movie. I think if the director would have had more day time shots the film would not have been the same. This film was outstanding and I would highly recommend that you rent it and see for yourselves.
