    To be honest, I had never heard of this film until I came across it on- line. The blurb sounded OK so I thought why not, it is slow and I could sort of see where it was going but having said that, the acting is good from all the main leads. A young Gwyneth Paltrow plays a brilliant misguided young woman who certainly has a murky past. I have never been a big Meg Ryan fan but this is probably the best performance I have seen from her, too bad it happened 20 years ago. The story is, as I've already said, quite easy to predict. The hole thing revolves around a traumatic incident which is witnessed by a young boy. Dennis Quaid plays the grown up version of that young boy and does it convincingly with an understated performance. I've given this film a 7/10 overall. I'd give the acting 10/10 and also the script 10/10. The characters are believable and the acting is quite naturalistic. The reason I give the film overall a 7 is the predictability.

    "We are each our own devil, and we make this world our hell."  Oscar Wilde One of the best "forgotten films" of the 1990s, "Flesh and Bone" was written and directed by Steve Kloves. Due to the film's box-office failure, Kloves abandoned film directing as a career. Dennis Quaid plays Arlis, a travelling vending machine repairman who hitches up with a perky but wounded girl called Kay (played by actress Meg Ryan). Kay falls in love with Arlis, but because his murderous father slaughtered her family many years ago, Arlis refuses to get close to her. He believes himself to be carrying the very same evil that flows through his father's veins. Better to stay alone, Arlis thinks, away from humanity. Stick to fixing vending machines, lay low, and don't give evil a chance to work through you. That's his code. Unfortunately Daddy, played by James Caan, then comes to town, forcing Arlis to make a choice: embrace evil to vanquish evil, or step aside and let evil prevail. Arlis' pacifism, his repression, his fear of becoming his violent father, is typical of the genre (think Will Munny in "Unforgiven" or Michael Shannon in "Shotgun Stories"). What Kloves does, though, is mirrors Arlis' anxieties about his own violent potential to the free-spirited personality of Kay, a woman who slowly draws Arlis out of his shell. Symbolically she wills Arlis' father out of the past, forcing the son to confront a history which he's spent his life repressing. If the film's demarcations (good, evil, light, dark, father, son) seem simplistic, it's because the film is tapping into a rich culture of Texan noirs, Southern Gothic literature and Westerns ("Unforgiven", "The Searchers", "Shotgun Stories", "Badlands", "Days of Heaven", "Lone Star", "Blood Simple" etc), all of which tend to rely on fairly simple archetypes. But this is the film's strength. It's a gloomy fairy tale, with actor James Caan as the manipulative, terrifying, big bad wolf, and Randy and Meg as two hapless kids lost in the enchanted forest. Kloves starts his tale quietly  literally a silent home invasion  and then slowly builds the tension. His shots are straight out of the noir and Wild West textbook, actors striking John Wayne poses, often framed by doorways or dwarfed by empty, Texan vistas. When the actors speak they talk with wonderfully moody prose, and when they're not talking they're silently scowling or brooding, chewing scenery like Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name feasts on tobacco. The film's quiet shots of Texas highways, flatlands and motels recall Terrance Malick and Wim Wenders. The film lacks their thematic depth, though, content to be a literal study of the way the "sins of the father" may or may not infect subsequent generations. At its best, though, the film is a dark journey which oozes malevolence and is thick with atmosphere. You don't watch this film, so much as you savour its unsettling mood while waiting for something happen. 8/10  Whatever flaws the film has are covered by extremely well written dialogue. Makes a good companion piece to "Shotgun Stories" and "Unforgiven". Worth one viewing.

    I thought the performances were very good, but not good enough to overcome some gaping plot holes in this film. First, why is Roy shadowing his son after all these years? We are told that he just needs Arlis to attend to his birdshot wounds. But he had been standing outside Arlis' motel room the night before. Why didn't he have Ginnie knock on the door instead of leaving a cigar butt, and waiting a good long while before getting the treatment he no doubt needed? It seemed to me that by the time he finally got around to getting Arlis into that car, his wounds would have healed over. Second, why did Arlis get into a car with a broad that he already knew was a con artist? Third, as has been noted, why would Roy care that Kay was still alive? Everyone had forgotten the murders - she knew nothing, and could prove nothing. Fourth, why did Roy have Ginnie lure Arlis to the house where he planned to kill Kay? It would have made sense if he planned to kill both of them, but he didn't need Arlis there to kill Kay. Caan would have had to play Roy as a psycho that wanted to kill Kay in front of Arlis rather than just a sociopath who wanted to tie up loose ends.

    Once in a while you come across someone who is a little odd, or haunted, or unsociable, or all of the above, and you wonder to yourself how they might have gotten that way. What made them that way? Why are they so terminally sad? Steve Koves has brought us the back story on those questions. His script and handling of the story are stellar. This is not a happy film, but it is a fascinating one. Everyone in this cast is at their best. But it is Dennis Quaid, who gives the best performance of his ample career, that breaths this story to life, or, death, as it were. He plays Arliss. Arliss has a nickel and dime vending machine business that takes him through the most desolate parts of Texas. His work is so lowly that he doesn't even handle paper money. Coins and dyed chickens are his stock and trade. He pours himself into his boring work as if he is trying to take his mind off of something. Something unpleasant. We know what that something is from the opening of the movie. What unfolds now is the picture of what a destroyed life looks like as it tries to outrun it's past. Quaid is brilliant at creating a haunted and wounded Arliss without making him pathetic. He is the obscure guy you might run across unexpectedly that makes you go, hmmm, what happened to him. There is nothing about this film that isn't first rate. I am mystified by it's "average" rating here on this site. I suppose if you hate good scripts, skillful directing, brilliant performances, and haunting sound and cinematography, I guess I could see giving this movie a 5. It is certainly possible not to like this type of film. But it is negligent, as a viewer, not to acknowledge it's quality. It is an excellent piece of film making and Dennis Quaid shows just what a brilliant and understated actor he can be. James Caan, Meg Ryan, and Gwyneth Paltrow are also up to Quaids level here. I highly recommend this movie. It's different. It's interesting. It's engrossing. And it's brilliantly done.

    If this film had been made in black-and-white in the 1940s, it would surely by now be regarded as a classic. But shot in sweeping colour, set against panoramas of the Texas outback, to a backdrop alternating between isolated bars and run-down motels, sunny plains and dark rainstorms, this must be one of the best modern films noir I've seen in a long time. The four main characters -- played brilliantly and understatedly by Quaid, Ryan, Caan and Paltrow -- are bound together as events unfold and their layers are gradually peeled back for us: aspects of the darker side of human nature that raise questions about blood ties ("flesh and bone") and feelings, guilt and conscience (or the lack of it), and responsibility. I'm surprised I haven't come across this film before, and delighted to have have it now in my collection. An unsung gem, tersely written and thoughtfully directed by Steve Kloves, and brilliantly visualised by cinematographer Philippe Rousselot and editor Mia Goldman. There are no excesses, great little touches and observations, hidden depths, and a lean story. Definitely one to see again.

    I liked the two main characters. To me, they were becoming intimate gradually (the Quaid character being cautious) but there was palpable movement towards trust from both. They had a connection. So what gives with the ending? He just leaves her and goes back to his lonely salesman lifestyle. Why? He's already made love to her. He has no girlfriend at home. She had no kids and certainly would have made a good sidekick for him. And he'd just saved her life! I don't get why they didn't ride off together. And while I'm at it, why does the Caan character have to kill the Meg Ryan character? She's not a witness. And even if she discovers her families' past what's she going to do--shoot him? Turn him in? It'd be a hard case to make. And she's not a witness. The only witness would probably not cooperate--that being the Dennis Quaid character (and his childhood recollections would be suspect anyway.) It seems like a good criminal would only commit murder when it's absolutely necessary. And this doesn't seem to qualify. Plus he knows his son won't let him do it. So maybe he's using his son to help him commit suicide. Hmmm.

    A compelling movie with earthy characters and slow seemingly unintentional situations. And sometimes as drab as a West Texas sandstorm. Dennis Quaid is excellent as the laid back Arlis Sweeney, a vending machine distributor, who lives with the memories of a multiple murder committed by his father Roy(James Caan)decades ago. On his West Texas vending circuit, Arlis meets up with a young waitress with marital problems. Kay(Meg Ryan)is brooding, but easily as wild as a "March hare". This is back in the day when Ryan could curdle blood with a girlish pout. There is reluctant chemistry between Kay and Arlis...but unbridled passion. The story gets a little deep and dark with the arrival of a wounded Roy and his round-a-about hanger-on girlfriend Ginnie(Gwyneth Paltrow). Ryan makes the best of the dialog. The scenery is interesting, bleak and humble; filmed at Monohans in the vicinity of Odessa, Texas.

    You will never see Meg Ryan in a role like this. She was phenomenal and it is unfortunate she did not get more roles like this. Dennis Quaid and Gwyneth Paltrow were also excellent and these three make the film worth watching. James Caan is fine, but his role is so one- dimensional that no actor can do much with it, and indeed he didn't. This film is a must see because of the characters. The plot is compelling and very dark, but the characters shine through and illuminate each other in a way that is unique because each character has dimensions that are not explained. Paltrow's character seems like a throwaway, but may be the most important of all. If I were teaching a course on film, I would select this one and ask the students to explain why it works. I usually think I know why a film is excellent, and yet after this film ended, I knew I could not put it into words. The purpose of this review is to suggest you watch this one if you get a chance because you may love it. Most who watched this movie were pleased but unenthusiastic. This film is much, much better than the 6.2 rating it had when I checked.

    This is not a film where everything appears obvious. It is dark and complicated. It is about how the past haunts you and affects your life in the present. It is the stuff that Freud would have fun dealing with. The stars in this film give performances that are among the best in their careers. Dennis Quaid (Frequency, Far From Heaven) is clearly the lead in this picture as the son of a soulless murderer and thief (James Caan). He carries the devil with him through his life and it affects his relationships with women. He runs into an abused housewife (Meg Ryan, in a non-romantic role), and they travel the back-roads of Texas together. Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakesphere in Love) is a thief that plays Caan's companion, even if he is old enough to be her grandfather. This is written and directed by the Oscar nominated (Wonder Boys) writer of all of the Harry Potter movies, Steve Kloves. He does a fabulous job. Definitely a movie to watch when you get a chance.

    A compelling movie with earthy characters and slow seemingly unintentional situations. And sometimes as drab as a West Texas sandstorm. Dennis Quaid is excellent as the laid back Arlis Sweeney, a vending machine distributor, who lives with the memories of a multiple murder committed by his father Roy(James Caan)decades ago. On his West Texas vending circuit, Arlis meets up with a young waitress with marital problems. Kay(Meg Ryan)is brooding, but easily as wild as a "March hare". This is back in the day when Ryan could curdle blood with a girlish pout. There is reluctant chemistry between Kay and Arlis...but unbridled passion. The story gets a little deep and dark with the arrival of a wounded Roy and his round-a-about hanger-on girlfriend Ginnie(Gwyneth Paltrow). Ryan makes the best of the dialog. The scenery is interesting, bleak and humble; filmed at Monohans in the vicinity of Odessa, Texas.

    You will never see Meg Ryan in a role like this. She was phenomenal and it is unfortunate she did not get more roles like this. Dennis Quaid and Gwyneth Paltrow were also excellent and these three make the film worth watching. James Caan is fine, but his role is so one- dimensional that no actor can do much with it, and indeed he didn't. This film is a must see because of the characters. The plot is compelling and very dark, but the characters shine through and illuminate each other in a way that is unique because each character has dimensions that are not explained. Paltrow's character seems like a throwaway, but may be the most important of all. If I were teaching a course on film, I would select this one and ask the students to explain why it works. I usually think I know why a film is excellent, and yet after this film ended, I knew I could not put it into words. The purpose of this review is to suggest you watch this one if you get a chance because you may love it. Most who watched this movie were pleased but unenthusiastic. This film is much, much better than the 6.2 rating it had when I checked.

    This is not a film where everything appears obvious. It is dark and complicated. It is about how the past haunts you and affects your life in the present. It is the stuff that Freud would have fun dealing with. The stars in this film give performances that are among the best in their careers. Dennis Quaid (Frequency, Far From Heaven) is clearly the lead in this picture as the son of a soulless murderer and thief (James Caan). He carries the devil with him through his life and it affects his relationships with women. He runs into an abused housewife (Meg Ryan, in a non-romantic role), and they travel the back-roads of Texas together. Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakesphere in Love) is a thief that plays Caan's companion, even if he is old enough to be her grandfather. This is written and directed by the Oscar nominated (Wonder Boys) writer of all of the Harry Potter movies, Steve Kloves. He does a fabulous job. Definitely a movie to watch when you get a chance.

    To be honest, I had never heard of this film until I came across it on- line. The blurb sounded OK so I thought why not, it is slow and I could sort of see where it was going but having said that, the acting is good from all the main leads. A young Gwyneth Paltrow plays a brilliant misguided young woman who certainly has a murky past. I have never been a big Meg Ryan fan but this is probably the best performance I have seen from her, too bad it happened 20 years ago. The story is, as I've already said, quite easy to predict. The hole thing revolves around a traumatic incident which is witnessed by a young boy. Dennis Quaid plays the grown up version of that young boy and does it convincingly with an understated performance. I've given this film a 7/10 overall. I'd give the acting 10/10 and also the script 10/10. The characters are believable and the acting is quite naturalistic. The reason I give the film overall a 7 is the predictability.

    "We are each our own devil, and we make this world our hell."  Oscar Wilde One of the best "forgotten films" of the 1990s, "Flesh and Bone" was written and directed by Steve Kloves. Due to the film's box-office failure, Kloves abandoned film directing as a career. Dennis Quaid plays Arlis, a travelling vending machine repairman who hitches up with a perky but wounded girl called Kay (played by actress Meg Ryan). Kay falls in love with Arlis, but because his murderous father slaughtered her family many years ago, Arlis refuses to get close to her. He believes himself to be carrying the very same evil that flows through his father's veins. Better to stay alone, Arlis thinks, away from humanity. Stick to fixing vending machines, lay low, and don't give evil a chance to work through you. That's his code. Unfortunately Daddy, played by James Caan, then comes to town, forcing Arlis to make a choice: embrace evil to vanquish evil, or step aside and let evil prevail. Arlis' pacifism, his repression, his fear of becoming his violent father, is typical of the genre (think Will Munny in "Unforgiven" or Michael Shannon in "Shotgun Stories"). What Kloves does, though, is mirrors Arlis' anxieties about his own violent potential to the free-spirited personality of Kay, a woman who slowly draws Arlis out of his shell. Symbolically she wills Arlis' father out of the past, forcing the son to confront a history which he's spent his life repressing. If the film's demarcations (good, evil, light, dark, father, son) seem simplistic, it's because the film is tapping into a rich culture of Texan noirs, Southern Gothic literature and Westerns ("Unforgiven", "The Searchers", "Shotgun Stories", "Badlands", "Days of Heaven", "Lone Star", "Blood Simple" etc), all of which tend to rely on fairly simple archetypes. But this is the film's strength. It's a gloomy fairy tale, with actor James Caan as the manipulative, terrifying, big bad wolf, and Randy and Meg as two hapless kids lost in the enchanted forest. Kloves starts his tale quietly  literally a silent home invasion  and then slowly builds the tension. His shots are straight out of the noir and Wild West textbook, actors striking John Wayne poses, often framed by doorways or dwarfed by empty, Texan vistas. When the actors speak they talk with wonderfully moody prose, and when they're not talking they're silently scowling or brooding, chewing scenery like Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name feasts on tobacco. The film's quiet shots of Texas highways, flatlands and motels recall Terrance Malick and Wim Wenders. The film lacks their thematic depth, though, content to be a literal study of the way the "sins of the father" may or may not infect subsequent generations. At its best, though, the film is a dark journey which oozes malevolence and is thick with atmosphere. You don't watch this film, so much as you savour its unsettling mood while waiting for something happen. 8/10  Whatever flaws the film has are covered by extremely well written dialogue. Makes a good companion piece to "Shotgun Stories" and "Unforgiven". Worth one viewing.

    I thought the performances were very good, but not good enough to overcome some gaping plot holes in this film. First, why is Roy shadowing his son after all these years? We are told that he just needs Arlis to attend to his birdshot wounds. But he had been standing outside Arlis' motel room the night before. Why didn't he have Ginnie knock on the door instead of leaving a cigar butt, and waiting a good long while before getting the treatment he no doubt needed? It seemed to me that by the time he finally got around to getting Arlis into that car, his wounds would have healed over. Second, why did Arlis get into a car with a broad that he already knew was a con artist? Third, as has been noted, why would Roy care that Kay was still alive? Everyone had forgotten the murders - she knew nothing, and could prove nothing. Fourth, why did Roy have Ginnie lure Arlis to the house where he planned to kill Kay? It would have made sense if he planned to kill both of them, but he didn't need Arlis there to kill Kay. Caan would have had to play Roy as a psycho that wanted to kill Kay in front of Arlis rather than just a sociopath who wanted to tie up loose ends.

    Once in a while you come across someone who is a little odd, or haunted, or unsociable, or all of the above, and you wonder to yourself how they might have gotten that way. What made them that way? Why are they so terminally sad? Steve Koves has brought us the back story on those questions. His script and handling of the story are stellar. This is not a happy film, but it is a fascinating one. Everyone in this cast is at their best. But it is Dennis Quaid, who gives the best performance of his ample career, that breaths this story to life, or, death, as it were. He plays Arliss. Arliss has a nickel and dime vending machine business that takes him through the most desolate parts of Texas. His work is so lowly that he doesn't even handle paper money. Coins and dyed chickens are his stock and trade. He pours himself into his boring work as if he is trying to take his mind off of something. Something unpleasant. We know what that something is from the opening of the movie. What unfolds now is the picture of what a destroyed life looks like as it tries to outrun it's past. Quaid is brilliant at creating a haunted and wounded Arliss without making him pathetic. He is the obscure guy you might run across unexpectedly that makes you go, hmmm, what happened to him. There is nothing about this film that isn't first rate. I am mystified by it's "average" rating here on this site. I suppose if you hate good scripts, skillful directing, brilliant performances, and haunting sound and cinematography, I guess I could see giving this movie a 5. It is certainly possible not to like this type of film. But it is negligent, as a viewer, not to acknowledge it's quality. It is an excellent piece of film making and Dennis Quaid shows just what a brilliant and understated actor he can be. James Caan, Meg Ryan, and Gwyneth Paltrow are also up to Quaids level here. I highly recommend this movie. It's different. It's interesting. It's engrossing. And it's brilliantly done.

    If this film had been made in black-and-white in the 1940s, it would surely by now be regarded as a classic. But shot in sweeping colour, set against panoramas of the Texas outback, to a backdrop alternating between isolated bars and run-down motels, sunny plains and dark rainstorms, this must be one of the best modern films noir I've seen in a long time. The four main characters -- played brilliantly and understatedly by Quaid, Ryan, Caan and Paltrow -- are bound together as events unfold and their layers are gradually peeled back for us: aspects of the darker side of human nature that raise questions about blood ties ("flesh and bone") and feelings, guilt and conscience (or the lack of it), and responsibility. I'm surprised I haven't come across this film before, and delighted to have have it now in my collection. An unsung gem, tersely written and thoughtfully directed by Steve Kloves, and brilliantly visualised by cinematographer Philippe Rousselot and editor Mia Goldman. There are no excesses, great little touches and observations, hidden depths, and a lean story. Definitely one to see again.

    I liked the two main characters. To me, they were becoming intimate gradually (the Quaid character being cautious) but there was palpable movement towards trust from both. They had a connection. So what gives with the ending? He just leaves her and goes back to his lonely salesman lifestyle. Why? He's already made love to her. He has no girlfriend at home. She had no kids and certainly would have made a good sidekick for him. And he'd just saved her life! I don't get why they didn't ride off together. And while I'm at it, why does the Caan character have to kill the Meg Ryan character? She's not a witness. And even if she discovers her families' past what's she going to do--shoot him? Turn him in? It'd be a hard case to make. And she's not a witness. The only witness would probably not cooperate--that being the Dennis Quaid character (and his childhood recollections would be suspect anyway.) It seems like a good criminal would only commit murder when it's absolutely necessary. And this doesn't seem to qualify. Plus he knows his son won't let him do it. So maybe he's using his son to help him commit suicide. Hmmm.

    A compelling movie with earthy characters and slow seemingly unintentional situations. And sometimes as drab as a West Texas sandstorm. Dennis Quaid is excellent as the laid back Arlis Sweeney, a vending machine distributor, who lives with the memories of a multiple murder committed by his father Roy(James Caan)decades ago. On his West Texas vending circuit, Arlis meets up with a young waitress with marital problems. Kay(Meg Ryan)is brooding, but easily as wild as a "March hare". This is back in the day when Ryan could curdle blood with a girlish pout. There is reluctant chemistry between Kay and Arlis...but unbridled passion. The story gets a little deep and dark with the arrival of a wounded Roy and his round-a-about hanger-on girlfriend Ginnie(Gwyneth Paltrow). Ryan makes the best of the dialog. The scenery is interesting, bleak and humble; filmed at Monohans in the vicinity of Odessa, Texas.

There are no excesses, great little touches and observations, hidden depths, and a lean story. Definitely one to see again.

    I liked the two main characters. To me, they were becoming intimate gradually (the Quaid character being cautious) but there was palpable movement towards trust from both. They had a connection. So what gives with the ending? He just leaves her and goes back to his lonely salesman lifestyle. Why? He's already made love to her. He has no girlfriend at home. She had no kids and certainly would have made a good sidekick for him. And he'd just saved her life! I don't get why they didn't ride off together. And while I'm at it, why does the Caan character have to kill the Meg Ryan character? She's not a witness. And even if she discovers her families' past what's she going to do--shoot him? Turn him in? It'd be a hard case to make. And she's not a witness. The only witness would probably not cooperate--that being the Dennis Quaid character (and his childhood recollections would be suspect anyway.) It seems like a good criminal would only commit murder when it's absolutely necessary. And this doesn't seem to qualify. Plus he knows his son won't let him do it. So maybe he's using his son to help him commit suicide. Hmmm.

    A compelling movie with earthy characters and slow seemingly unintentional situations. And sometimes as drab as a West Texas sandstorm. Dennis Quaid is excellent as the laid back Arlis Sweeney, a vending machine distributor, who lives with the memories of a multiple murder committed by his father Roy(James Caan)decades ago. On his West Texas vending circuit, Arlis meets up with a young waitress with marital problems. Kay(Meg Ryan)is brooding, but easily as wild as a "March hare". This is back in the day when Ryan could curdle blood with a girlish pout. There is reluctant chemistry between Kay and Arlis...but unbridled passion. The story gets a little deep and dark with the arrival of a wounded Roy and his round-a-about hanger-on girlfriend Ginnie(Gwyneth Paltrow). Ryan makes the best of the dialog. The scenery is interesting, bleak and humble; filmed at Monohans in the vicinity of Odessa, Texas.

    You will never see Meg Ryan in a role like this. She was phenomenal and it is unfortunate she did not get more roles like this. Dennis Quaid and Gwyneth Paltrow were also excellent and these three make the film worth watching. James Caan is fine, but his role is so one- dimensional that no actor can do much with it, and indeed he didn't. This film is a must see because of the characters. The plot is compelling and very dark, but the characters shine through and illuminate each other in a way that is unique because each character has dimensions that are not explained. Paltrow's character seems like a throwaway, but may be the most important of all. If I were teaching a course on film, I would select this one and ask the students to explain why it works. I usually think I know why a film is excellent, and yet after this film ended, I knew I could not put it into words. The purpose of this review is to suggest you watch this one if you get a chance because you may love it. Most who watched this movie were pleased but unenthusiastic. This film is much, much better than the 6.2 rating it had when I checked.

    This is not a film where everything appears obvious. It is dark and complicated. It is about how the past haunts you and affects your life in the present. It is the stuff that Freud would have fun dealing with. The stars in this film give performances that are among the best in their careers. Dennis Quaid (Frequency, Far From Heaven) is clearly the lead in this picture as the son of a soulless murderer and thief (James Caan). He carries the devil with him through his life and it affects his relationships with women. He runs into an abused housewife (Meg Ryan, in a non-romantic role), and they travel the back-roads of Texas together. Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakesphere in Love) is a thief that plays Caan's companion, even if he is old enough to be her grandfather. This is written and directed by the Oscar nominated (Wonder Boys) writer of all of the Harry Potter movies, Steve Kloves. He does a fabulous job. Definitely a movie to watch when you get a chance.
