 <sinopse>
  A power hungry sorcerer transforms a princess into a swan by day in this tale of everlasting love.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  As children, Prince Derek and Princess Odette are forced to spend their summers together by their widowed parents, who hope that the two will eventually fall in love and marry, so that the kingdoms of the two will be united. As children and adolescents, Derek and Odette can't stand each other, but as young adults they begin to see each other in a different light and fall in love with each other. But one night things take a bad turn when Derek unintentionally offends Odette, who then refuses to marry him if he can't prove that he loves her for who she is and not just her beauty. Odette and her father are then attacked by Lord Rothbart, a vengeful sorcerer who was cast out of William's kingdom when he plotted against the king. In the form of a beast, Rothbart mortally wounds William, and kidnaps Odette then places her under a spell. Now it is up to Derek to rescue Odette by showing his undying love. But, will he be in time?

    This is very much an 80s style animation with the singing, the drawing, and the subject matter. Prince Derek and Princess Odette are forced to spend their summers together by their widowed parents hoping for them to fall in love. Just when they seem to do just that, Derek says "You're beautiful.", and Odette ask "What else?". Derek could only reply "What else is there?". Then the evil sorcerer Lord Rothbart kidnaps Odette then places her under a spell that turns her into a swan and back to a woman when she's on the lake as the moon rise. When moonlight leaves the lake, she's turn back into a swan. The only way to break the spell is to have her love make a vow of everlasting love. All the characters are straight out of 80s Disney movies. And quite frankly, it works on that terms. The animation, the jokes, the princess subject, the songs... all of it works but only on that term.

    I have seen so many animated movies from different studios and I must say I'm a huge fan of this genre. But this is obviously the worst I've ever seen. Poor script and visual directing, awful sound effect and character voicing, no artistic elements, and not to mention terrible music... This movie came out in 1994 and I can see that at that time Disney was at the top of the animated film market and was the only studio to have had a long history of making this type of film, while others were just beginning, this may partly explain why New Line Cinema did a terrible job on this movie. But seriously, Richard Rich, the director, had had directed a few movies for Disney before and they're good ones, not this bad! I gave this movie 4 stars out of 10 because that's all I think it deserves.

    Far Longer Than Forever is one of the greatest songs on this movie's soundtrack, and you may just yet love it far longer than forever. I saw this movie when it came out when I was maybe 5 years old and to this day, at 25 years old, I still listen to the music and if I ever get my hands on the movie would definitely watch it again. The soundtrack is really good, and I can say that there is a good lesson to be learned from the movie for both boys and girls. It is about a princess and a prince whom since birth were plotted by their father and mother, respectively, to wed and unite the kingdoms. They spend every summer together and like most growing boys and girls, go through the different phases of friendships. By the time they are old enough, they immediately overcome hating each other and fall in love. An evil foe executes a long awaited plan to thwart the king and kidnaps his daughter. He puts a spell on her that turns her into a swan unless she is standing in the light of the moon. She befriends a turtle and a frog and together they help end her curse and reunite her with her true love.

    1994 was a really rough year for animation. Other than Disney's "The Lion King", there weren't many good animated films released the same year. "The Pagemaster" had a lot of potential but fell flat, "The Princess and the Goblin" was downright dreadful, and "Thumbelina" was a disappointment on Don Bluth's part. This movie however, is an impressive achievement! Despite needing a prince at her side, Odette is a strong and likable heroine, who just wants to be accepted for who she is and not how she looks. Prince Derek is bland at best, but he's not as wimpy as Cornielious from "Thumbelina". However, the best characters in this movie are the supporting ones. Rogers, Derek's head servant, and Queen Uberta, Derek's mother, are both very funny as well as Odette's animal friends, Jean-Bob the frog, Speed the turtle and (my favorite) Puffin the bird. Another great character in this movie, is Rothbart. He's truly a memorable villain, with his cunning schemes and excellent performance by Jack Pallance, he also has a witty sense of humor (which aren't very common for villains like this). All of the songs are really beautiful and well written, though a couple of them are a little too long. Although not a perfect movie, "The Swan Princess" is definitely one of the better Disney knock-offs, and I highly recommend it!

    I've seen a lot of reviews belaboring the studio about a lack of plot. That's not exactly their fault since its BASED ON SWAN LAKE. Just putting that out there. Also I've heard Odette debates about whether she's a flat stupid princess. No. She refuses Derek when he wants to marry her just for her looks. She helps him find her. She breaks out of the dungeon with the help of her friends. She flies who knows how many miles to try and stop Derek from making a mistake. She didn't do anything to help save him BECAUSE SHE WAS PRACTICALLY DEAD. So sorry she didn't just suddenly get better and destroy a frightening giant dragon thing. What an awful character. A disgrace to women truly. Seriously? In the sequels she saves the kingdom, the queen, Derek, herself, etc. she's not a flat character. She's a wonderful princess. Unlike Cinderella-yay she fits into a shoe, sleeping beauty-she's great at slumber parties, etc. I've also seen a lot of grief over the animation. It's pretty old of course the animation will be lacking, but it's pretty good in my opinion. All in all it's a great movie in my opinion. I'm 18 and I still watch it fairly regularly. I show my little sister. I'd recommend it to anyone with children. The music is wonderful and somewhat hokey but that's one reason it's great! That's all.

    After Disney released "The Lion King" which has been met with critical praise and became a success at the box office for the company, Disney animator Richard Rich (known for directing "The Fox and the Hound" and "The Black Cauldron") teams up with New Line Cinema to make their very first animated feature, "The Swan Princess", based on the Swan Lake ballet. It tells the story about two kids named Derek & Odette who started to hate each other for about a long time until one day, as young adults, they finally realize that they do love each other, but Derek ruins the wedding by saying "What else is there?" and they will never see each other again. Meanwhile, an evil sorcerer named Rothbart captures Odette and turns her into a swan that would only turn her back into a human as the moon rises. As Derek tries to find Odette by learning from his mistake, Odette and her animal friends Jean-Bob, a frog, Speed, a turtle, and Puffin, a bird attempts to bring her back to Derek. I first saw this film when I was a child and it has been stuck with me ever since even as a young adult (I'm turning 19 soon, by the way). It still holds up, but there are two problems that I do have with this classic. The animation is beautiful and colorful, but is a bit deflated some of the time. Derek is a bland character, but is a somewhat sympathetic character since he learned that to love a woman is to prove his love for her. Flaws aside, everything else still holds up. The story is very original and sticks closely to the ballet without any ballet dances which works for me. The characters are charming and likable; Odette is a beautiful and feisty character and I liked her hair as well. The side characters including Bromley, Rogers (whose line "How To Offend Women In 5 Syllables Or Less made me laugh) and Uberta, who never fails to steal every scene in the movie. The animal sidekicks including Jean-Bob, Speed, and Puffin are excellent. The villain Rothbart, voiced by the late Jack Palace, is great and his motives, although over-the-top, are very amusing. The songs, on the whole, are pleasant and memorable to listen to especially "Far Longer Than Forever". Even the ending is satisfying. The battle between Derek and Rothbart is the best highlight of the movie because it represents some of the past-Disney films with a style and tone to it. Overall, The Swan Princess isn't a masterpiece, but it's by no means a cult classic that has been stuck with me since my childhood. It may have received a mixed reception when it was first released, but I'm recommending this to those who love Disney and Non-Disney films.

    This has to be my favorite movie of all time. I will never be tired of watching it. The story line is adorable and great for kids, but intelligent enough for adults to enjoy. I especially like the art style. Everything is so bouncy. I love the way everyone's dresses and hair moves. The music is so catchy, fun and beautiful to just listen to by itself. All the characters have some much depth, not just the main ones. It has been years since the last time I've watched this movie and I could still name almost every character and their story. I'd also love to do my best impersonation. They are so funny. Odette, above all, is so feisty, for a female character she is very strong and independent, and not so love struck as to just jump in head over heals, but wants to take her time before marriage.

    I remember being 8 years old and watching this movie endlessly. I also recall singing "For longer than forever" over and over again (I'm such a sucker for that kind of songs). Recently, I had been trying to recall the song unsuccessfully, and when I found it on Netflix, I jumped in for old time's sake and because I wanted to hear the song. Watching it 12 years later resulted in disappointment regarding the plot line, character development, animation, voice acting and lyrics. That may seem to imply I hated it, but I didn't. It is actually more than the sum of it's parts, mostly, I think, because it follows the formula of every princess movie that ever existed, and that worked out. I also think something that really saves this movie is the sidekick ensemble. Jean Bob + Speed work very well together and are a lot of fun. Puffin is very likable. Bromley and Rogers are a very fun companion to Prince Derek, and both villains are indeed very entertaining. The scenes containing these are very fun. Music-wise, it is also very formulaic, borrowing incredibly from Beauty and the Beast (in my opinion). It works, though. I think the ideas for the songs were very clever, although the execution was not very well done. For Longer than Forever is good. Not great, but you will find yourself humming it every once in a while. I think children will enjoy this, and if you take it lightheartedly, you will like it too. I also noticed this is a good movie for watching over and over and over... It's easy to switch in and out, and works well being played on the background. I really understand why I loved this as a child.

    Well I personally loved the movie when I was little and still love it now as an adult. It was that movie that I could watch 100 times and still love it. It had everything you wanted from a movie, it has fantasy, mystery, action, romance, comedy, and drama. It had songs you would be singing the next day, it had unforgettable quote "what else is there?". The movie isn't for everyone especially people who prefer visually stunning pieces or deeper character depth. They don't go into great characterization especially of the romances, as they just seem to fall in love. Showing this recently to little cousins they don't see the brilliance of the story behind the movie. I love this movie and the sequels. Not for everyone but a favorite of mine.

    OK, so "The Swan Princess" is another children's movie. When I saw it, I thought that it was really neat that John Cleese provided the voice of the frog, and I later found out that Jack Palance (once known for "Shane", now known for "City Slickers") provided the voice of the villain. Who would have envisioned those two plus Steven Wright and Frank Welker (Fred on "Scooby-Doo" and Ray on "The Real Ghostbusters") in an animated feature? It wasn't until years after I saw the movie that I found out what the source material was: while in St. Petersburg, I attended a production of Pyotr Chaikovsky's "Swan Lake" in the Mariinsky Theater and realized that it was the same characters. Of course, what stuck in my mind most of all was the haunting theme song. That ballet is more recently recognizable as the subject of "Black Swan" (which I haven't seen). Anyway, the movie's nothing particularly special. Michelle Nicastro, who provided the voice of Odette, was an opera singer (she died of cancer last year). Howard McGillin, who provided the voice of Derek, was one of the people who played the Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera".

    Well I personally loved the movie when I was little and still love it now as an adult. It was that movie that I could watch 100 times and still love it. It had everything you wanted from a movie, it has fantasy, mystery, action, romance, comedy, and drama. It had songs you would be singing the next day, it had unforgettable quote "what else is there?". The movie isn't for everyone especially people who prefer visually stunning pieces or deeper character depth. They don't go into great characterization especially of the romances, as they just seem to fall in love. Showing this recently to little cousins they don't see the brilliance of the story behind the movie. I love this movie and the sequels. Not for everyone but a favorite of mine.

    OK, so "The Swan Princess" is another children's movie. When I saw it, I thought that it was really neat that John Cleese provided the voice of the frog, and I later found out that Jack Palance (once known for "Shane", now known for "City Slickers") provided the voice of the villain. Who would have envisioned those two plus Steven Wright and Frank Welker (Fred on "Scooby-Doo" and Ray on "The Real Ghostbusters") in an animated feature? It wasn't until years after I saw the movie that I found out what the source material was: while in St. Petersburg, I attended a production of Pyotr Chaikovsky's "Swan Lake" in the Mariinsky Theater and realized that it was the same characters. Of course, what stuck in my mind most of all was the haunting theme song. That ballet is more recently recognizable as the subject of "Black Swan" (which I haven't seen). Anyway, the movie's nothing particularly special. Michelle Nicastro, who provided the voice of Odette, was an opera singer (she died of cancer last year). Howard McGillin, who provided the voice of Derek, was one of the people who played the Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera".

    This is very much an 80s style animation with the singing, the drawing, and the subject matter. Prince Derek and Princess Odette are forced to spend their summers together by their widowed parents hoping for them to fall in love. Just when they seem to do just that, Derek says "You're beautiful.", and Odette ask "What else?". Derek could only reply "What else is there?". Then the evil sorcerer Lord Rothbart kidnaps Odette then places her under a spell that turns her into a swan and back to a woman when she's on the lake as the moon rise. When moonlight leaves the lake, she's turn back into a swan. The only way to break the spell is to have her love make a vow of everlasting love. All the characters are straight out of 80s Disney movies. And quite frankly, it works on that terms. The animation, the jokes, the princess subject, the songs... all of it works but only on that term.

    I have seen so many animated movies from different studios and I must say I'm a huge fan of this genre. But this is obviously the worst I've ever seen. Poor script and visual directing, awful sound effect and character voicing, no artistic elements, and not to mention terrible music... This movie came out in 1994 and I can see that at that time Disney was at the top of the animated film market and was the only studio to have had a long history of making this type of film, while others were just beginning, this may partly explain why New Line Cinema did a terrible job on this movie. But seriously, Richard Rich, the director, had had directed a few movies for Disney before and they're good ones, not this bad! I gave this movie 4 stars out of 10 because that's all I think it deserves.

    Far Longer Than Forever is one of the greatest songs on this movie's soundtrack, and you may just yet love it far longer than forever. I saw this movie when it came out when I was maybe 5 years old and to this day, at 25 years old, I still listen to the music and if I ever get my hands on the movie would definitely watch it again. The soundtrack is really good, and I can say that there is a good lesson to be learned from the movie for both boys and girls. It is about a princess and a prince whom since birth were plotted by their father and mother, respectively, to wed and unite the kingdoms. They spend every summer together and like most growing boys and girls, go through the different phases of friendships. By the time they are old enough, they immediately overcome hating each other and fall in love. An evil foe executes a long awaited plan to thwart the king and kidnaps his daughter. He puts a spell on her that turns her into a swan unless she is standing in the light of the moon. She befriends a turtle and a frog and together they help end her curse and reunite her with her true love.

    1994 was a really rough year for animation. Other than Disney's "The Lion King", there weren't many good animated films released the same year. "The Pagemaster" had a lot of potential but fell flat, "The Princess and the Goblin" was downright dreadful, and "Thumbelina" was a disappointment on Don Bluth's part. This movie however, is an impressive achievement! Despite needing a prince at her side, Odette is a strong and likable heroine, who just wants to be accepted for who she is and not how she looks. Prince Derek is bland at best, but he's not as wimpy as Cornielious from "Thumbelina". However, the best characters in this movie are the supporting ones. Rogers, Derek's head servant, and Queen Uberta, Derek's mother, are both very funny as well as Odette's animal friends, Jean-Bob the frog, Speed the turtle and (my favorite) Puffin the bird. Another great character in this movie, is Rothbart. He's truly a memorable villain, with his cunning schemes and excellent performance by Jack Pallance, he also has a witty sense of humor (which aren't very common for villains like this). All of the songs are really beautiful and well written, though a couple of them are a little too long. Although not a perfect movie, "The Swan Princess" is definitely one of the better Disney knock-offs, and I highly recommend it!

    I've seen a lot of reviews belaboring the studio about a lack of plot. That's not exactly their fault since its BASED ON SWAN LAKE. Just putting that out there. Also I've heard Odette debates about whether she's a flat stupid princess. No. She refuses Derek when he wants to marry her just for her looks. She helps him find her. She breaks out of the dungeon with the help of her friends. She flies who knows how many miles to try and stop Derek from making a mistake. She didn't do anything to help save him BECAUSE SHE WAS PRACTICALLY DEAD. So sorry she didn't just suddenly get better and destroy a frightening giant dragon thing. What an awful character. A disgrace to women truly. Seriously? In the sequels she saves the kingdom, the queen, Derek, herself, etc. she's not a flat character. She's a wonderful princess. Unlike Cinderella-yay she fits into a shoe, sleeping beauty-she's great at slumber parties, etc. I've also seen a lot of grief over the animation. It's pretty old of course the animation will be lacking, but it's pretty good in my opinion. All in all it's a great movie in my opinion. I'm 18 and I still watch it fairly regularly. I show my little sister. I'd recommend it to anyone with children. The music is wonderful and somewhat hokey but that's one reason it's great! That's all.

    After Disney released "The Lion King" which has been met with critical praise and became a success at the box office for the company, Disney animator Richard Rich (known for directing "The Fox and the Hound" and "The Black Cauldron") teams up with New Line Cinema to make their very first animated feature, "The Swan Princess", based on the Swan Lake ballet. It tells the story about two kids named Derek & Odette who started to hate each other for about a long time until one day, as young adults, they finally realize that they do love each other, but Derek ruins the wedding by saying "What else is there?" and they will never see each other again. Meanwhile, an evil sorcerer named Rothbart captures Odette and turns her into a swan that would only turn her back into a human as the moon rises. As Derek tries to find Odette by learning from his mistake, Odette and her animal friends Jean-Bob, a frog, Speed, a turtle, and Puffin, a bird attempts to bring her back to Derek. I first saw this film when I was a child and it has been stuck with me ever since even as a young adult (I'm turning 19 soon, by the way). It still holds up, but there are two problems that I do have with this classic. The animation is beautiful and colorful, but is a bit deflated some of the time. Derek is a bland character, but is a somewhat sympathetic character since he learned that to love a woman is to prove his love for her. Flaws aside, everything else still holds up. The story is very original and sticks closely to the ballet without any ballet dances which works for me. The characters are charming and likable; Odette is a beautiful and feisty character and I liked her hair as well. The side characters including Bromley, Rogers (whose line "How To Offend Women In 5 Syllables Or Less made me laugh) and Uberta, who never fails to steal every scene in the movie. The animal sidekicks including Jean-Bob, Speed, and Puffin are excellent. The villain Rothbart, voiced by the late Jack Palace, is great and his motives, although over-the-top, are very amusing. The songs, on the whole, are pleasant and memorable to listen to especially "Far Longer Than Forever". Even the ending is satisfying. The battle between Derek and Rothbart is the best highlight of the movie because it represents some of the past-Disney films with a style and tone to it. Overall, The Swan Princess isn't a masterpiece, but it's by no means a cult classic that has been stuck with me since my childhood. It may have received a mixed reception when it was first released, but I'm recommending this to those who love Disney and Non-Disney films.

    This has to be my favorite movie of all time. I will never be tired of watching it. The story line is adorable and great for kids, but intelligent enough for adults to enjoy. I especially like the art style. Everything is so bouncy. I love the way everyone's dresses and hair moves. The music is so catchy, fun and beautiful to just listen to by itself. All the characters have some much depth, not just the main ones. It has been years since the last time I've watched this movie and I could still name almost every character and their story. I'd also love to do my best impersonation. They are so funny. Odette, above all, is so feisty, for a female character she is very strong and independent, and not so love struck as to just jump in head over heals, but wants to take her time before marriage.

    I remember being 8 years old and watching this movie endlessly. I also recall singing "For longer than forever" over and over again (I'm such a sucker for that kind of songs). Recently, I had been trying to recall the song unsuccessfully, and when I found it on Netflix, I jumped in for old time's sake and because I wanted to hear the song. Watching it 12 years later resulted in disappointment regarding the plot line, character development, animation, voice acting and lyrics. That may seem to imply I hated it, but I didn't. It is actually more than the sum of it's parts, mostly, I think, because it follows the formula of every princess movie that ever existed, and that worked out. I also think something that really saves this movie is the sidekick ensemble. Jean Bob + Speed work very well together and are a lot of fun. Puffin is very likable. Bromley and Rogers are a very fun companion to Prince Derek, and both villains are indeed very entertaining. The scenes containing these are very fun. Music-wise, it is also very formulaic, borrowing incredibly from Beauty and the Beast (in my opinion). It works, though. I think the ideas for the songs were very clever, although the execution was not very well done. For Longer than Forever is good. Not great, but you will find yourself humming it every once in a while. I think children will enjoy this, and if you take it lightheartedly, you will like it too. I also noticed this is a good movie for watching over and over and over... It's easy to switch in and out, and works well being played on the background. I really understand why I loved this as a child.

It had everything you wanted from a movie, it has fantasy, mystery, action, romance, comedy, and drama. It had songs you would be singing the next day, it had unforgettable quote "what else is there?". The movie isn't for everyone especially people who prefer visually stunning pieces or deeper character depth. They don't go into great characterization especially of the romances, as they just seem to fall in love. Showing this recently to little cousins they don't see the brilliance of the story behind the movie. I love this movie and the sequels. Not for everyone but a favorite of mine.

    OK, so "The Swan Princess" is another children's movie. When I saw it, I thought that it was really neat that John Cleese provided the voice of the frog, and I later found out that Jack Palance (once known for "Shane", now known for "City Slickers") provided the voice of the villain. Who would have envisioned those two plus Steven Wright and Frank Welker (Fred on "Scooby-Doo" and Ray on "The Real Ghostbusters") in an animated feature? It wasn't until years after I saw the movie that I found out what the source material was: while in St. Petersburg, I attended a production of Pyotr Chaikovsky's "Swan Lake" in the Mariinsky Theater and realized that it was the same characters. Of course, what stuck in my mind most of all was the haunting theme song. That ballet is more recently recognizable as the subject of "Black Swan" (which I haven't seen). Anyway, the movie's nothing particularly special. Michelle Nicastro, who provided the voice of Odette, was an opera singer (she died of cancer last year). Howard McGillin, who provided the voice of Derek, was one of the people who played the Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera".

    This is very much an 80s style animation with the singing, the drawing, and the subject matter. Prince Derek and Princess Odette are forced to spend their summers together by their widowed parents hoping for them to fall in love. Just when they seem to do just that, Derek says "You're beautiful.", and Odette ask "What else?". Derek could only reply "What else is there?". Then the evil sorcerer Lord Rothbart kidnaps Odette then places her under a spell that turns her into a swan and back to a woman when she's on the lake as the moon rise. When moonlight leaves the lake, she's turn back into a swan. The only way to break the spell is to have her love make a vow of everlasting love. All the characters are straight out of 80s Disney movies. And quite frankly, it works on that terms. The animation, the jokes, the princess subject, the songs... all of it works but only on that term.

    I have seen so many animated movies from different studios and I must say I'm a huge fan of this genre. But this is obviously the worst I've ever seen. Poor script and visual directing, awful sound effect and character voicing, no artistic elements, and not to mention terrible music... This movie came out in 1994 and I can see that at that time Disney was at the top of the animated film market and was the only studio to have had a long history of making this type of film, while others were just beginning, this may partly explain why New Line Cinema did a terrible job on this movie. But seriously, Richard Rich, the director, had had directed a few movies for Disney before and they're good ones, not this bad! I gave this movie 4 stars out of 10 because that's all I think it deserves.

    Far Longer Than Forever is one of the greatest songs on this movie's soundtrack, and you may just yet love it far longer than forever. I saw this movie when it came out when I was maybe 5 years old and to this day, at 25 years old, I still listen to the music and if I ever get my hands on the movie would definitely watch it again. The soundtrack is really good, and I can say that there is a good lesson to be learned from the movie for both boys and girls. It is about a princess and a prince whom since birth were plotted by their father and mother, respectively, to wed and unite the kingdoms. They spend every summer together and like most growing boys and girls, go through the different phases of friendships. By the time they are old enough, they immediately overcome hating each other and fall in love. An evil foe executes a long awaited plan to thwart the king and kidnaps his daughter. He puts a spell on her that turns her into a swan unless she is standing in the light of the moon. She befriends a turtle and a frog and together they help end her curse and reunite her with her true love.

    1994 was a really rough year for animation. Other than Disney's "The Lion King", there weren't many good animated films released the same year. "The Pagemaster" had a lot of potential but fell flat, "The Princess and the Goblin" was downright dreadful, and "Thumbelina" was a disappointment on Don Bluth's part. This movie however, is an impressive achievement! Despite needing a prince at her side, Odette is a strong and likable heroine, who just wants to be accepted for who she is and not how she looks. Prince Derek is bland at best, but he's not as wimpy as Cornielious from "Thumbelina". However, the best characters in this movie are the supporting ones. Rogers, Derek's head servant, and Queen Uberta, Derek's mother, are both very funny as well as Odette's animal friends, Jean-Bob the frog, Speed the turtle and (my favorite) Puffin the bird. Another great character in this movie, is Rothbart. He's truly a memorable villain, with his cunning schemes and excellent performance by Jack Pallance, he also has a witty sense of humor (which aren't very common for villains like this). All of the songs are really beautiful and well written, though a couple of them are a little too long. Although not a perfect movie, "The Swan Princess" is definitely one of the better Disney knock-offs, and I highly recommend it!

    I've seen a lot of reviews belaboring the studio about a lack of plot. That's not exactly their fault since its BASED ON SWAN LAKE. Just putting that out there. Also I've heard Odette debates about whether she's a flat stupid princess. No. She refuses Derek when he wants to marry her just for her looks. She helps him find her. She breaks out of the dungeon with the help of her friends. She flies who knows how many miles to try and stop Derek from making a mistake. She didn't do anything to help save him BECAUSE SHE WAS PRACTICALLY DEAD. So sorry she didn't just suddenly get better and destroy a frightening giant dragon thing. What an awful character. A disgrace to women truly. Seriously? In the sequels she saves the kingdom, the queen, Derek, herself, etc. she's not a flat character. She's a wonderful princess. Unlike Cinderella-yay she fits into a shoe, sleeping beauty-she's great at slumber parties, etc. I've also seen a lot of grief over the animation. It's pretty old of course the animation will be lacking, but it's pretty good in my opinion. All in all it's a great movie in my opinion. I'm 18 and I still watch it fairly regularly. I show my little sister. I'd recommend it to anyone with children. The music is wonderful and somewhat hokey but that's one reason it's great! That's all.

    After Disney released "The Lion King" which has been met with critical praise and became a success at the box office for the company, Disney animator Richard Rich (known for directing "The Fox and the Hound" and "The Black Cauldron") teams up with New Line Cinema to make their very first animated feature, "The Swan Princess", based on the Swan Lake ballet. It tells the story about two kids named Derek & Odette who started to hate each other for about a long time until one day, as young adults, they finally realize that they do love each other, but Derek ruins the wedding by saying "What else is there?" and they will never see each other again. Meanwhile, an evil sorcerer named Rothbart captures Odette and turns her into a swan that would only turn her back into a human as the moon rises. As Derek tries to find Odette by learning from his mistake, Odette and her animal friends Jean-Bob, a frog, Speed, a turtle, and Puffin, a bird attempts to bring her back to Derek. I first saw this film when I was a child and it has been stuck with me ever since even as a young adult (I'm turning 19 soon, by the way). It still holds up, but there are two problems that I do have with this classic. The animation is beautiful and colorful, but is a bit deflated some of the time. Derek is a bland character, but is a somewhat sympathetic character since he learned that to love a woman is to prove his love for her. Flaws aside, everything else still holds up. The story is very original and sticks closely to the ballet without any ballet dances which works for me. The characters are charming and likable; Odette is a beautiful and feisty character and I liked her hair as well. The side characters including Bromley, Rogers (whose line "How To Offend Women In 5 Syllables Or Less made me laugh) and Uberta, who never fails to steal every scene in the movie. The animal sidekicks including Jean-Bob, Speed, and Puffin are excellent. The villain Rothbart, voiced by the late Jack Palace, is great and his motives, although over-the-top, are very amusing. The songs, on the whole, are pleasant and memorable to listen to especially "Far Longer Than Forever". Even the ending is satisfying. The battle between Derek and Rothbart is the best highlight of the movie because it represents some of the past-Disney films with a style and tone to it. Overall, The Swan Princess isn't a masterpiece, but it's by no means a cult classic that has been stuck with me since my childhood. It may have received a mixed reception when it was first released, but I'm recommending this to those who love Disney and Non-Disney films.

    This has to be my favorite movie of all time. I will never be tired of watching it. The story line is adorable and great for kids, but intelligent enough for adults to enjoy. I especially like the art style. Everything is so bouncy. I love the way everyone's dresses and hair moves. The music is so catchy, fun and beautiful to just listen to by itself. All the characters have some much depth, not just the main ones. It has been years since the last time I've watched this movie and I could still name almost every character and their story. I'd also love to do my best impersonation. They are so funny. Odette, above all, is so feisty, for a female character she is very strong and independent, and not so love struck as to just jump in head over heals, but wants to take her time before marriage.

    I remember being 8 years old and watching this movie endlessly. I also recall singing "For longer than forever" over and over again (I'm such a sucker for that kind of songs). Recently, I had been trying to recall the song unsuccessfully, and when I found it on Netflix, I jumped in for old time's sake and because I wanted to hear the song. Watching it 12 years later resulted in disappointment regarding the plot line, character development, animation, voice acting and lyrics. That may seem to imply I hated it, but I didn't. It is actually more than the sum of it's parts, mostly, I think, because it follows the formula of every princess movie that ever existed, and that worked out. I also think something that really saves this movie is the sidekick ensemble. Jean Bob + Speed work very well together and are a lot of fun. Puffin is very likable. Bromley and Rogers are a very fun companion to Prince Derek, and both villains are indeed very entertaining. The scenes containing these are very fun. Music-wise, it is also very formulaic, borrowing incredibly from Beauty and the Beast (in my opinion). It works, though. I think the ideas for the songs were very clever, although the execution was not very well done. For Longer than Forever is good. Not great, but you will find yourself humming it every once in a while. I think children will enjoy this, and if you take it lightheartedly, you will like it too. I also noticed this is a good movie for watching over and over and over... It's easy to switch in and out, and works well being played on the background. I really understand why I loved this as a child.
