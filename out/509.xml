    I like Daniel Day-Lewis. I get what he was after (not milking our sympathy and giving an accurate portrayal). That said, this movie was boring. Boring. First of all, the storyline is just not that great. I realize it's Christy Brown's life. I don't dispute that he's amazing; nor that his mom was amazing; nor his siblings, who, too, are wonderfully loving. It's just not that great a "plot." Secondly, I can be very emotional, but this movie didn't make me cry, laugh, feel indignant, or teach me any great life lesson. I wasn't inspired, and felt no sense of triumph. Thirdly, watching the movie was like someone saying to me, "Hey, there's this guy I read about with cerebral palsy. All he could control was his left foot, so he wrote and painted with it. His paintings were actually very good, and he typed with his toe." My response? "Wow" (with no exclamation point). Am I interested to hear more? No. Am I glad he told me? Not really. Lastly, Daniel Day-Lewis's acting was so good, that I could understand only 15% of his words. Tough to watch a movie when you can't understand the main character. Give me a break. This may be the case with some individuals with severe CP (but not with my CP friends, 90% of whose words I understand), but even if it were the case for Christy Brown, I mean--come on--I'm watching a movie here. Make me a concession. I know, I know. If he were my brother, I'd have to learn. But this is a movie. I've got two hours, not a background of twelve years listening to this guy and thereby learning to understand him. Speak understandably, DDL, for the sake of the movie viewers; we'll still get your point. DDL's unclear speech causes one to try to figure out through the whole movie what he's just said by the context of how everyone else in the movie responds. Let me understand his words. Speak so that I can. Ugghhh.

    Wonderful movie, Christy Brown is as cripple as Hamlet. He was not "Nothing" so he chose not to end his life. We love his high spirited hopefulness and his refusal to be a vegetable. Millions are mentally and creativity wise more cripple than Christy Brown. The movie depicts the protagonist fighting a great war against outside circumstances ( being a cripple ) and inside world - a desire to make his mark in spite of his apparent inability to create specially in the situation when most around him thought that he was nothing more than a vegetable. I feel Christy Brown represents the modern man struggling against the hostile world without and within. The support of the family, specially the mother figure represents the only hope that we have got - the fellow human beings. Daniel Day Lewis rightly earned his Oscar for his performance. Simply the best.

    This film is about the life of Christy Brown--a man who, despite being almost completely disabled, was able to make something of himself and prove that every life is of value. When he was born in 1932, doctors recommended to his parents that Christy be placed in a home for the disabled--in other words, a 'warehouse' where he would have been dumped. However, despite his severe cerebral palsy, his parents brought him home and raised him despite the odds--a real oddity for that period of time. The story follows Christy from his birth until has later years when he eventually gained fame for his art as well as his autobiography, "My Left Foot"--named that because it was his only usable limb. When you watch the film, you will marvel at the acting. While Daniel Day-Lewis received the Oscar for his great and very realistic portrayal of Brown, I am not sure why the child who played Brown as a child didn't get some sort of recognition--as he was great also. And, I especially appreciated it because too often child actors are, to put it bluntly, terrible. Yet, Hugh O'Conor was every bit as wonderful as Day-Lewis. On the other hand, once again, the history teacher in me strikes again. As I watched this biopic about the Irish author/painter Christy Brown, I couldn't help but feel a bit annoyed that the ending painted a completely false picture of the man's final years. In this Hollywood-like ending, Brown apparently has a very happy final years. However, this was NOT at all true---and his final years were quite pathetic--filled with alcoholism and an an early death. I really don't think the film needed the happy ending and knocked a point off for this. Still, overall an exceptional film--one well worth your time.

    If I were to heavily praise 'My Left Foot', there would be a 95% chance that I'd be heavily complimenting the astonishing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis more than anything. It is a great story with some excellent writing based on a very inspirational man named Christy Brown, but said man is captured so expertly by Day-Lewis that everything else great about the movie is easily ignored. Regarded as being one of the most 'real' actors of all-time, Daniel Day- Lewis reportedly stayed in character throughout the filming process, some may criticize the approach, but when you watch him on the screen, you can tell that all the hard work paid off to the fullest extent. He captures the discomfort, frustration and loneliness of a man with cerebral palsy, and the passion of a man labelled as 'gifted' but is far more 'gifted' than people really know. From top to bottom, 'My Left Foot' is a huge recommendation for any movie fan, and a definite must-see for any aspiring actor.

    My Left Foot was released in 1989, and likely contained the best acting of that year. I was extremely excited to watch this movie after just seeing Lincoln and realizing what an amazing actor Daniel Day-Lewis is. Besides this and Lincoln, he has also won an Oscar for There Will Be Blood, which I intend to see as soon as possible. It is an older movie, so the quality and style of filmmaking has since changed, but it was still a very good watch. This is an actor's movie. More specifically, this is Daniel Day-Lewis' movie. His work in this is absolutely remarkable, with the way that he completely immersed himself in the role. He plays Christy Brown, a man born with Cerebral Palsy, who is only able to move his neck and his left foot (more like his left leg actually.) This alone is an incredible task on Daniel Day-Lewis' part, having to confine his acting to almost complete paralysis, while gaining remarkable control of his foot, but he also had the inability to talk. Halfway through the film, a character comes in and teaches him to speak, but even after that his voice is very unclear. This was an almost impossible role for anyone to take on, but he was committed enough the he was able to very successfully play it. Through his incredible method of becoming his character rather than portraying it, he was able to take this character where nobody else could. In fact, during the filming of this movie, he hired someone to wheel him around in a wheelchair so that he could remain in character during and away from filming. Supporting actors are rather difficult to concentrate on in a movie like this, but Brenda Fricker, who played Christy Brown's loving and loyal mother, gave a very good performance, winning herself an Oscar. However, Daniel Day-Lewis was the focus of this movie, and he has proved himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and definitely my favorite. Jim Sheridan, who has been nominated for six Oscars (two for my Left Foot,) wrote and directed this picture. Frankly, I was rather disappointed with the movie as a whole. The story was a little random with which parts of his life that they decided to show. There were many times when I was ready to move on to later in his life, or content and wanting more of the time I was in. I also would have preferred for it to have been a little longer, it was only one hundred minutes, which is rather short for a live-action film, and especially a biography. Mainly, I just felt that I hadn't seen enough of Christy Brown when the movie finished, when honestly I could have watched Daniel Day-Lewis' performance for many hours before getting tired or bored. I wasn't at all impressed with the directing in this movie, but Daniel Day-Lewis' transformation into Christy Brown was in the end what made this movie an incredible watch. I was torn with this film, I was very disappointed by the directing and writing, but was completely blown away by the acting. Thankfully, I prefer to weigh goods over bads, so after all I loved this movie. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supportig Actress, along with three unsuccessful nominations for Adapted Screenplay, Directing, and Best Picture. I give this movie a disappointed but pleased 8/10.

    This is based on the autobiography of Christy Brown, a man born with a cerebral palsy, and had to learn how to do things through the only limb that he had control over, and that limb was the title object, his left foot. This film is truly an outstanding movie, it's a masterpiece, one of the best movies of 1989, and even one of the best movies of all time. When I started to watch this film, I didn't expect to see what I saw, I was expecting to see a movie with good acting and good storytelling and writing. THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENY MY FRIENDS! This movie is one of the most wonderful movies ever to play on my television set, it's a wonderful and touching true story of a man who was able to become a success with his only controllable limb. This is a great feel good movie, and it is one of the best movies to portray somebody with a cerebral palsy. One problem I have with this film is that I wish that the real Christy Brown would have lived to see this movie, because he would have been absolutely astounded at how accurately Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed him. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our time, and here, he is sublime (well, he usually is sublime in just about every movie that he's in). Like his role in In The Name Of The Father, his performance in this film is like no Daniel Day-Lewis performance I've ever seen. When I saw this film, I could have sworn that Daniel Day-Lewis WAS Christy Brown, and I could have sworn that he had a cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis couldn't have possibly done a better job than he did already, he was outstanding beyond words, and he deserved the Academy Award For Best Actor, his first of three wins (he would win two more for There Will Be Blood in 2007, and most recently, Lincoln in 2012). Brenda Fricker also won an Oscar, she would the award for Best Supporting Actress, which was also a well deserved win. As great a job as the rest of the cast did, none of them were as outstanding as Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives one of the best film performances of any movie that I have ever seen, a distinction that I rarely award to actors in movies. So all in all, this is truly an outstanding movie, and it features one of the greatest actors of our time, giving a role that is one of the best performances of any movie. Daniel Day-Lewis has made many great movies, such as There Will Be Blood, Gangs Of New York, and In The Name Of The Father, but My Left Foot is his best performance, he was beyond outstanding, when it came to acting, he was in a class by himself, a level of greatness higher than the highest! Okay, that sounds a little odd, but you'll probably get the point. What makes Daniel Day-Lewis outstanding is probably the fact that he is very selective with what he chooses, I mean that since 1997, he's been in only five movies. But hey, that's a good thing, because there's a good chance that the movie is going to be excellent. But getting back to this film, you've definitely got to see it, you will not believe your eyes when you watch this. When this movie has ended, you will say that you have just viewed one of the greatest movies ever made, as that is exactly what this movie is. 10/10

    The best way to describe a film like Jim Sheridan's 1989 drama My Left Foot is that it is a film that satisfies and dissatisfies both at the same time. On one hand, it does what it's supposed to do which is look into the life of the story's main character. On the other hand, I felt that something about this story was missing and I ended up really wanting much more than what I got. Let's focus on what's good about this film first and foremost: Daniel Day-Lewis himself. No one else but Daniel Day-Lewis could have successfully pulled off the role of a disabled Irishman who can only move with his left foot and yet become an inspiring artist. The way that he disappears into his character and convinces us that he has these physical and mental struggles is nothing short of expertly done. Daniel Day-Lewis isn't the only cast member of this picture that delivers impressive acting, Brenda Fricker is also exceptional as his mother who tries her best to figure out how to take care of her son. Fiona Shaw is also pretty decent as a doctor who forms a special bond with the main character. These three performances are basically the best aspect of this film. Despite that praise, I feel that the storytelling and screenplay for this film is very much a double edged sword. Like I stated earlier, while the storytelling is very efficient and keeps moving along, I could make the argument that it moves a little too fast. What I mean by that statement is that I felt there were parts of the story that felt incomplete in my mind. For example, the main character has a relationship with this one woman in the chronological end of this story given that the story's told through flashbacks. We only see this certain character for about 10 minutes at most and we are given no reason why she's necessary to the plot. In addition to this, while I felt that we got to knew the Day- Lewis character okay enough, I knew little to nothing about everyone else to the point where I forgot about them. I really had no idea what I thought about this picture immediately after watching it and I still have no idea if I still like or dislike the film even while writing the very review you are reading. While I can't say there's anything really terrible about it and recognize the acting skill behind it, I could also say that there aspects of this film that are completely forgettable. It really is a close call, but in the end, I'm afraid that due to its lack of making an impact on me, I can't recommend My Left Foot.

    My Left Foot is the Irish director Jim Sheridan's first film. It is based on the real life story of Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. His left foot was his only controllable limb, and it was this very left foot that changed his life forever, turning him into a master painter and story teller, thanks to his intelligence and perseverance, and, last but not least, his mother. The film is very touching but it does not fall into the trap of the exaggerated sentimentality that we might see in similar subjects. The film is also realistic; Christy's move from an incomprehensible spastic quadriplegic in a poor family to the respectable painter and writer was not an even path. His constant isolation is felt in his constant drinking, his several failed romances and his strained relations with many of those around him, particularly his father. It is mainly the love for his mother which keeps him going. But in his high moments, he cannot escape the isolation he feels as a result of his physical difference with others. There are a few people who really understand him and those few people become the reason for his happiness in the end. The film has the hopeful message that nothing is impossible if you really believe in yourself and those who care for you. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another dazzling performance as Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. Both won Oscars for their roles.

    Christy Brown (1932-1981) was a famous Irish painter and writer born in a family of 22 children. The fact that he was one of the 13 survivors is pretty ironic considering the severe condition he was born with: cerebral palsy. Christy couldn't control his body as if he was in a perpetual battle between his muscles and his will, but destiny, in all mercifulness, left him one avenue to communicate: his left foot. Would you think it was thin consolation? For Christy, it was enough: he could grab objects, hit the doors and eventually write and paint, express his thoughts, and his torments, for cerebral palsy never affected his capacity to learn, to understand, even to surpass the others' intelligence and sensitivity. "My Left Foot" is the inspirational story of Christy Brown. Christy's struggle starts within his own family where everyone is convinced that he would never be able to get an education, although he's loved and treated like a Brown, he's the cripple of the Family, not to say the retarded. One of the hardest to watch scenes of the film occurs when the father (Ray McAnnaly in his last performance) helps his boy to do his homework and has to find out what a quarter of 25% is. For him, it doesn't make sense since 25% is already a quarter but poor Christy Brown gets the answer and desperately tries to write 1/16 with a piece of chalk between his toes, nobody understands. The scene was frustrating and heartbreaking enough to create a totally opposite feeling when Christy writes M-O-T-H- E-R on the floor, the kids cheer, the father is proud and goes buy a drink, Mrs. Brown is overwhelmed, but not that surprised. Hugh O'Connor delivers a magnificent performance, which I'm sure if it was longer, would have earned him more awards. But behind the obligatory cheers, there are more insightful and more thought-provoking lessons to be learned. Mr. Brown refused to put him in an institution, because it would be a disgrace. At that time, they probably didn't expect him to survive or maybe it would cost money but it's on the basis of this decision that the parents allowed Christy to grow up in a normal background, and not have his inspiration being suffocated by medical assistance. Had Christy been born in a rich family, he wouldn't have become this talented artist, and it's even clearer considering the life he had. Brown was treated equally to his brothers, he was toughened by the street, he played soccer, he drank at pubs, he hit and got hit, he was an Irishman in flesh and blood, and it shows all through the film. The genius of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is to never let the feeling of a one-note personality but on the contrary, convey through his body language, his facial expressions and his burning eyes, a tormenting passion and a ferocious desire to live like everybody and to be loved, he can love but it's all about being loved. The 'love' side is plainly occupied by the other powerful performance of the film, Brenda Fricker (who won the Oscar). She's not just the typical Irish mother, who was pregnant during 16 years (I admit, I counted), she incarnates the capability of a mother to understand her boy. Respect and love are important, but understanding someone is sometimes more valuable. She knows what he feels and even foresees the deceptions. In one movingly intelligent scene, she disapproves Christy's growing affection toward the beautiful doctor Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw). Something isn't right in Christy's voice, too hopeful. Her motherly instinct doesn't fool her because the hope in Christy is quickly destroyed when Eileen reveals that she's going to be married. Daniel Day-Lewis is so powerful that you could literally see his heart being blown into pieces, and the way the situation becomes more and more out of control, reveals a dark, almost creepy, side in his personality, a dependence to alcohol and an almost childish incapability to accept his condition, his heart suffers much more than the body, but who could blame him? The power of "My Left Foot" is to rather take an ordinary look of low-budgeted TV family drama rather than a grandiose Hollywood- type biopic, which fits the tone of the film. But it's definitely the three-dimensional, vibrating and passionate Oscar-winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis that reminds you it's not a TV film. However, the movie is not without a few flaws that don't ruin the overall feeling though. At one scene, the father discovers that his wife was saving money for a wheelchair, we wait for his reaction but then it cuts abruptly to him playing with his kid, tickling him. The mother announces that their daughter is going to marry someone because she's pregnant. Mr. Brown's outburst of rage causes Christy to go into a sort of angry trance, trembling and drooling like a rabid dog, he's eager to kill his father. I thought Christy's reaction was disproportionate regarding an attitude than any father would have, much more in that time. It seemed to me that he was supposed to be a hateful character while he was not. The 'porridge' scene was also confusing because it tried to turn Mr. Brown into a real douche-bag while there were more scenes showing pride than animosity between him and Christy, and nothing to show a sort of complicity between Christy and his sister. Apart from these little details, "My Left Foot" tells a great story, about a great character, it's not perfect, but what the heck: humanity is full of remarkable examples of persons whose talent and hard work allow them to overcame their handicap and to communicate with the rest of the world and if it was not for Jim Sheridan's adaptation of the biographic book "My Left Foot" and for Daniel Day-Lewis' extraordinary performance, many of us wouldn't have heard of Christy Brown.

    This film is about the life of Christy Brown--a man who, despite being almost completely disabled, was able to make something of himself and prove that every life is of value. When he was born in 1932, doctors recommended to his parents that Christy be placed in a home for the disabled--in other words, a 'warehouse' where he would have been dumped. However, despite his severe cerebral palsy, his parents brought him home and raised him despite the odds--a real oddity for that period of time. The story follows Christy from his birth until has later years when he eventually gained fame for his art as well as his autobiography, "My Left Foot"--named that because it was his only usable limb. When you watch the film, you will marvel at the acting. While Daniel Day-Lewis received the Oscar for his great and very realistic portrayal of Brown, I am not sure why the child who played Brown as a child didn't get some sort of recognition--as he was great also. And, I especially appreciated it because too often child actors are, to put it bluntly, terrible. Yet, Hugh O'Conor was every bit as wonderful as Day-Lewis. On the other hand, once again, the history teacher in me strikes again. As I watched this biopic about the Irish author/painter Christy Brown, I couldn't help but feel a bit annoyed that the ending painted a completely false picture of the man's final years. In this Hollywood-like ending, Brown apparently has a very happy final years. However, this was NOT at all true---and his final years were quite pathetic--filled with alcoholism and an an early death. I really don't think the film needed the happy ending and knocked a point off for this. Still, overall an exceptional film--one well worth your time.

    If I were to heavily praise 'My Left Foot', there would be a 95% chance that I'd be heavily complimenting the astonishing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis more than anything. It is a great story with some excellent writing based on a very inspirational man named Christy Brown, but said man is captured so expertly by Day-Lewis that everything else great about the movie is easily ignored. Regarded as being one of the most 'real' actors of all-time, Daniel Day- Lewis reportedly stayed in character throughout the filming process, some may criticize the approach, but when you watch him on the screen, you can tell that all the hard work paid off to the fullest extent. He captures the discomfort, frustration and loneliness of a man with cerebral palsy, and the passion of a man labelled as 'gifted' but is far more 'gifted' than people really know. From top to bottom, 'My Left Foot' is a huge recommendation for any movie fan, and a definite must-see for any aspiring actor.

    My Left Foot was released in 1989, and likely contained the best acting of that year. I was extremely excited to watch this movie after just seeing Lincoln and realizing what an amazing actor Daniel Day-Lewis is. Besides this and Lincoln, he has also won an Oscar for There Will Be Blood, which I intend to see as soon as possible. It is an older movie, so the quality and style of filmmaking has since changed, but it was still a very good watch. This is an actor's movie. More specifically, this is Daniel Day-Lewis' movie. His work in this is absolutely remarkable, with the way that he completely immersed himself in the role. He plays Christy Brown, a man born with Cerebral Palsy, who is only able to move his neck and his left foot (more like his left leg actually.) This alone is an incredible task on Daniel Day-Lewis' part, having to confine his acting to almost complete paralysis, while gaining remarkable control of his foot, but he also had the inability to talk. Halfway through the film, a character comes in and teaches him to speak, but even after that his voice is very unclear. This was an almost impossible role for anyone to take on, but he was committed enough the he was able to very successfully play it. Through his incredible method of becoming his character rather than portraying it, he was able to take this character where nobody else could. In fact, during the filming of this movie, he hired someone to wheel him around in a wheelchair so that he could remain in character during and away from filming. Supporting actors are rather difficult to concentrate on in a movie like this, but Brenda Fricker, who played Christy Brown's loving and loyal mother, gave a very good performance, winning herself an Oscar. However, Daniel Day-Lewis was the focus of this movie, and he has proved himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and definitely my favorite. Jim Sheridan, who has been nominated for six Oscars (two for my Left Foot,) wrote and directed this picture. Frankly, I was rather disappointed with the movie as a whole. The story was a little random with which parts of his life that they decided to show. There were many times when I was ready to move on to later in his life, or content and wanting more of the time I was in. I also would have preferred for it to have been a little longer, it was only one hundred minutes, which is rather short for a live-action film, and especially a biography. Mainly, I just felt that I hadn't seen enough of Christy Brown when the movie finished, when honestly I could have watched Daniel Day-Lewis' performance for many hours before getting tired or bored. I wasn't at all impressed with the directing in this movie, but Daniel Day-Lewis' transformation into Christy Brown was in the end what made this movie an incredible watch. I was torn with this film, I was very disappointed by the directing and writing, but was completely blown away by the acting. Thankfully, I prefer to weigh goods over bads, so after all I loved this movie. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supportig Actress, along with three unsuccessful nominations for Adapted Screenplay, Directing, and Best Picture. I give this movie a disappointed but pleased 8/10.

    This is based on the autobiography of Christy Brown, a man born with a cerebral palsy, and had to learn how to do things through the only limb that he had control over, and that limb was the title object, his left foot. This film is truly an outstanding movie, it's a masterpiece, one of the best movies of 1989, and even one of the best movies of all time. When I started to watch this film, I didn't expect to see what I saw, I was expecting to see a movie with good acting and good storytelling and writing. THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENY MY FRIENDS! This movie is one of the most wonderful movies ever to play on my television set, it's a wonderful and touching true story of a man who was able to become a success with his only controllable limb. This is a great feel good movie, and it is one of the best movies to portray somebody with a cerebral palsy. One problem I have with this film is that I wish that the real Christy Brown would have lived to see this movie, because he would have been absolutely astounded at how accurately Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed him. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our time, and here, he is sublime (well, he usually is sublime in just about every movie that he's in). Like his role in In The Name Of The Father, his performance in this film is like no Daniel Day-Lewis performance I've ever seen. When I saw this film, I could have sworn that Daniel Day-Lewis WAS Christy Brown, and I could have sworn that he had a cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis couldn't have possibly done a better job than he did already, he was outstanding beyond words, and he deserved the Academy Award For Best Actor, his first of three wins (he would win two more for There Will Be Blood in 2007, and most recently, Lincoln in 2012). Brenda Fricker also won an Oscar, she would the award for Best Supporting Actress, which was also a well deserved win. As great a job as the rest of the cast did, none of them were as outstanding as Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives one of the best film performances of any movie that I have ever seen, a distinction that I rarely award to actors in movies. So all in all, this is truly an outstanding movie, and it features one of the greatest actors of our time, giving a role that is one of the best performances of any movie. Daniel Day-Lewis has made many great movies, such as There Will Be Blood, Gangs Of New York, and In The Name Of The Father, but My Left Foot is his best performance, he was beyond outstanding, when it came to acting, he was in a class by himself, a level of greatness higher than the highest! Okay, that sounds a little odd, but you'll probably get the point. What makes Daniel Day-Lewis outstanding is probably the fact that he is very selective with what he chooses, I mean that since 1997, he's been in only five movies. But hey, that's a good thing, because there's a good chance that the movie is going to be excellent. But getting back to this film, you've definitely got to see it, you will not believe your eyes when you watch this. When this movie has ended, you will say that you have just viewed one of the greatest movies ever made, as that is exactly what this movie is. 10/10

    The best way to describe a film like Jim Sheridan's 1989 drama My Left Foot is that it is a film that satisfies and dissatisfies both at the same time. On one hand, it does what it's supposed to do which is look into the life of the story's main character. On the other hand, I felt that something about this story was missing and I ended up really wanting much more than what I got. Let's focus on what's good about this film first and foremost: Daniel Day-Lewis himself. No one else but Daniel Day-Lewis could have successfully pulled off the role of a disabled Irishman who can only move with his left foot and yet become an inspiring artist. The way that he disappears into his character and convinces us that he has these physical and mental struggles is nothing short of expertly done. Daniel Day-Lewis isn't the only cast member of this picture that delivers impressive acting, Brenda Fricker is also exceptional as his mother who tries her best to figure out how to take care of her son. Fiona Shaw is also pretty decent as a doctor who forms a special bond with the main character. These three performances are basically the best aspect of this film. Despite that praise, I feel that the storytelling and screenplay for this film is very much a double edged sword. Like I stated earlier, while the storytelling is very efficient and keeps moving along, I could make the argument that it moves a little too fast. What I mean by that statement is that I felt there were parts of the story that felt incomplete in my mind. For example, the main character has a relationship with this one woman in the chronological end of this story given that the story's told through flashbacks. We only see this certain character for about 10 minutes at most and we are given no reason why she's necessary to the plot. In addition to this, while I felt that we got to knew the Day- Lewis character okay enough, I knew little to nothing about everyone else to the point where I forgot about them. I really had no idea what I thought about this picture immediately after watching it and I still have no idea if I still like or dislike the film even while writing the very review you are reading. While I can't say there's anything really terrible about it and recognize the acting skill behind it, I could also say that there aspects of this film that are completely forgettable. It really is a close call, but in the end, I'm afraid that due to its lack of making an impact on me, I can't recommend My Left Foot.

    My Left Foot is the Irish director Jim Sheridan's first film. It is based on the real life story of Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. His left foot was his only controllable limb, and it was this very left foot that changed his life forever, turning him into a master painter and story teller, thanks to his intelligence and perseverance, and, last but not least, his mother. The film is very touching but it does not fall into the trap of the exaggerated sentimentality that we might see in similar subjects. The film is also realistic; Christy's move from an incomprehensible spastic quadriplegic in a poor family to the respectable painter and writer was not an even path. His constant isolation is felt in his constant drinking, his several failed romances and his strained relations with many of those around him, particularly his father. It is mainly the love for his mother which keeps him going. But in his high moments, he cannot escape the isolation he feels as a result of his physical difference with others. There are a few people who really understand him and those few people become the reason for his happiness in the end. The film has the hopeful message that nothing is impossible if you really believe in yourself and those who care for you. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another dazzling performance as Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. Both won Oscars for their roles.

    Christy Brown (1932-1981) was a famous Irish painter and writer born in a family of 22 children. The fact that he was one of the 13 survivors is pretty ironic considering the severe condition he was born with: cerebral palsy. Christy couldn't control his body as if he was in a perpetual battle between his muscles and his will, but destiny, in all mercifulness, left him one avenue to communicate: his left foot. Would you think it was thin consolation? For Christy, it was enough: he could grab objects, hit the doors and eventually write and paint, express his thoughts, and his torments, for cerebral palsy never affected his capacity to learn, to understand, even to surpass the others' intelligence and sensitivity. "My Left Foot" is the inspirational story of Christy Brown. Christy's struggle starts within his own family where everyone is convinced that he would never be able to get an education, although he's loved and treated like a Brown, he's the cripple of the Family, not to say the retarded. One of the hardest to watch scenes of the film occurs when the father (Ray McAnnaly in his last performance) helps his boy to do his homework and has to find out what a quarter of 25% is. For him, it doesn't make sense since 25% is already a quarter but poor Christy Brown gets the answer and desperately tries to write 1/16 with a piece of chalk between his toes, nobody understands. The scene was frustrating and heartbreaking enough to create a totally opposite feeling when Christy writes M-O-T-H- E-R on the floor, the kids cheer, the father is proud and goes buy a drink, Mrs. Brown is overwhelmed, but not that surprised. Hugh O'Connor delivers a magnificent performance, which I'm sure if it was longer, would have earned him more awards. But behind the obligatory cheers, there are more insightful and more thought-provoking lessons to be learned. Mr. Brown refused to put him in an institution, because it would be a disgrace. At that time, they probably didn't expect him to survive or maybe it would cost money but it's on the basis of this decision that the parents allowed Christy to grow up in a normal background, and not have his inspiration being suffocated by medical assistance. Had Christy been born in a rich family, he wouldn't have become this talented artist, and it's even clearer considering the life he had. Brown was treated equally to his brothers, he was toughened by the street, he played soccer, he drank at pubs, he hit and got hit, he was an Irishman in flesh and blood, and it shows all through the film. The genius of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is to never let the feeling of a one-note personality but on the contrary, convey through his body language, his facial expressions and his burning eyes, a tormenting passion and a ferocious desire to live like everybody and to be loved, he can love but it's all about being loved. The 'love' side is plainly occupied by the other powerful performance of the film, Brenda Fricker (who won the Oscar). She's not just the typical Irish mother, who was pregnant during 16 years (I admit, I counted), she incarnates the capability of a mother to understand her boy. Respect and love are important, but understanding someone is sometimes more valuable. She knows what he feels and even foresees the deceptions. In one movingly intelligent scene, she disapproves Christy's growing affection toward the beautiful doctor Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw). Something isn't right in Christy's voice, too hopeful. Her motherly instinct doesn't fool her because the hope in Christy is quickly destroyed when Eileen reveals that she's going to be married. Daniel Day-Lewis is so powerful that you could literally see his heart being blown into pieces, and the way the situation becomes more and more out of control, reveals a dark, almost creepy, side in his personality, a dependence to alcohol and an almost childish incapability to accept his condition, his heart suffers much more than the body, but who could blame him? The power of "My Left Foot" is to rather take an ordinary look of low-budgeted TV family drama rather than a grandiose Hollywood- type biopic, which fits the tone of the film. But it's definitely the three-dimensional, vibrating and passionate Oscar-winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis that reminds you it's not a TV film. However, the movie is not without a few flaws that don't ruin the overall feeling though. At one scene, the father discovers that his wife was saving money for a wheelchair, we wait for his reaction but then it cuts abruptly to him playing with his kid, tickling him. The mother announces that their daughter is going to marry someone because she's pregnant. Mr. Brown's outburst of rage causes Christy to go into a sort of angry trance, trembling and drooling like a rabid dog, he's eager to kill his father. I thought Christy's reaction was disproportionate regarding an attitude than any father would have, much more in that time. It seemed to me that he was supposed to be a hateful character while he was not. The 'porridge' scene was also confusing because it tried to turn Mr. Brown into a real douche-bag while there were more scenes showing pride than animosity between him and Christy, and nothing to show a sort of complicity between Christy and his sister. Apart from these little details, "My Left Foot" tells a great story, about a great character, it's not perfect, but what the heck: humanity is full of remarkable examples of persons whose talent and hard work allow them to overcame their handicap and to communicate with the rest of the world and if it was not for Jim Sheridan's adaptation of the biographic book "My Left Foot" and for Daniel Day-Lewis' extraordinary performance, many of us wouldn't have heard of Christy Brown.

    I like Daniel Day-Lewis. I get what he was after (not milking our sympathy and giving an accurate portrayal). That said, this movie was boring. Boring. First of all, the storyline is just not that great. I realize it's Christy Brown's life. I don't dispute that he's amazing; nor that his mom was amazing; nor his siblings, who, too, are wonderfully loving. It's just not that great a "plot." Secondly, I can be very emotional, but this movie didn't make me cry, laugh, feel indignant, or teach me any great life lesson. I wasn't inspired, and felt no sense of triumph. Thirdly, watching the movie was like someone saying to me, "Hey, there's this guy I read about with cerebral palsy. All he could control was his left foot, so he wrote and painted with it. His paintings were actually very good, and he typed with his toe." My response? "Wow" (with no exclamation point). Am I interested to hear more? No. Am I glad he told me? Not really. Lastly, Daniel Day-Lewis's acting was so good, that I could understand only 15% of his words. Tough to watch a movie when you can't understand the main character. Give me a break. This may be the case with some individuals with severe CP (but not with my CP friends, 90% of whose words I understand), but even if it were the case for Christy Brown, I mean--come on--I'm watching a movie here. Make me a concession. I know, I know. If he were my brother, I'd have to learn. But this is a movie. I've got two hours, not a background of twelve years listening to this guy and thereby learning to understand him. Speak understandably, DDL, for the sake of the movie viewers; we'll still get your point. DDL's unclear speech causes one to try to figure out through the whole movie what he's just said by the context of how everyone else in the movie responds. Let me understand his words. Speak so that I can. Ugghhh.

    Wonderful movie, Christy Brown is as cripple as Hamlet. He was not "Nothing" so he chose not to end his life. We love his high spirited hopefulness and his refusal to be a vegetable. Millions are mentally and creativity wise more cripple than Christy Brown. The movie depicts the protagonist fighting a great war against outside circumstances ( being a cripple ) and inside world - a desire to make his mark in spite of his apparent inability to create specially in the situation when most around him thought that he was nothing more than a vegetable. I feel Christy Brown represents the modern man struggling against the hostile world without and within. The support of the family, specially the mother figure represents the only hope that we have got - the fellow human beings. Daniel Day Lewis rightly earned his Oscar for his performance. Simply the best.

    My Left Foot: The Story of Christy Brown is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very impressive cast.I thought this movie would be incredible but in wasn't nearly as good as I expected.I found it very boring at times,but Daniel Day-Lewis really made this movie what it is,his acting is incredible and inspired and he deserved the Academy Award for his performance,but I don't think Brenda Fricker did,I didn't find her performance that impressive.The movie did tell us the story of Christy Brown perfectly and put us in his position all the way through,but I am Irish,and I thought this movie would make me feel very proud of my country,other than Daniel Day-Lewis,it didn't really.If you enjoy dramatic biography movies and Daniel Day-Lewis,this movie certainly is a must see,but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it would. Adaption of Christy Brown's autobiography of how he overcame cerebral palsy to become an artist and author.

    This is based on the autobiography of Christy Brown, a man born with a cerebral palsy, and had to learn how to do things through the only limb that he had control over, and that limb was the title object, his left foot. This film is truly an outstanding movie, it's a masterpiece, one of the best movies of 1989, and even one of the best movies of all time. When I started to watch this film, I didn't expect to see what I saw, I was expecting to see a movie with good acting and good storytelling and writing. THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENY MY FRIENDS! This movie is one of the most wonderful movies ever to play on my television set, it's a wonderful and touching true story of a man who was able to become a success with his only controllable limb. This is a great feel good movie, and it is one of the best movies to portray somebody with a cerebral palsy. One problem I have with this film is that I wish that the real Christy Brown would have lived to see this movie, because he would have been absolutely astounded at how accurately Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed him. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our time, and here, he is sublime (well, he usually is sublime in just about every movie that he's in). Like his role in In The Name Of The Father, his performance in this film is like no Daniel Day-Lewis performance I've ever seen. When I saw this film, I could have sworn that Daniel Day-Lewis WAS Christy Brown, and I could have sworn that he had a cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis couldn't have possibly done a better job than he did already, he was outstanding beyond words, and he deserved the Academy Award For Best Actor, his first of three wins (he would win two more for There Will Be Blood in 2007, and most recently, Lincoln in 2012). Brenda Fricker also won an Oscar, she would the award for Best Supporting Actress, which was also a well deserved win. As great a job as the rest of the cast did, none of them were as outstanding as Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives one of the best film performances of any movie that I have ever seen, a distinction that I rarely award to actors in movies. So all in all, this is truly an outstanding movie, and it features one of the greatest actors of our time, giving a role that is one of the best performances of any movie. Daniel Day-Lewis has made many great movies, such as There Will Be Blood, Gangs Of New York, and In The Name Of The Father, but My Left Foot is his best performance, he was beyond outstanding, when it came to acting, he was in a class by himself, a level of greatness higher than the highest! Okay, that sounds a little odd, but you'll probably get the point. What makes Daniel Day-Lewis outstanding is probably the fact that he is very selective with what he chooses, I mean that since 1997, he's been in only five movies. But hey, that's a good thing, because there's a good chance that the movie is going to be excellent. But getting back to this film, you've definitely got to see it, you will not believe your eyes when you watch this. When this movie has ended, you will say that you have just viewed one of the greatest movies ever made, as that is exactly what this movie is. 10/10

    The best way to describe a film like Jim Sheridan's 1989 drama My Left Foot is that it is a film that satisfies and dissatisfies both at the same time. On one hand, it does what it's supposed to do which is look into the life of the story's main character. On the other hand, I felt that something about this story was missing and I ended up really wanting much more than what I got. Let's focus on what's good about this film first and foremost: Daniel Day-Lewis himself. No one else but Daniel Day-Lewis could have successfully pulled off the role of a disabled Irishman who can only move with his left foot and yet become an inspiring artist. The way that he disappears into his character and convinces us that he has these physical and mental struggles is nothing short of expertly done. Daniel Day-Lewis isn't the only cast member of this picture that delivers impressive acting, Brenda Fricker is also exceptional as his mother who tries her best to figure out how to take care of her son. Fiona Shaw is also pretty decent as a doctor who forms a special bond with the main character. These three performances are basically the best aspect of this film. Despite that praise, I feel that the storytelling and screenplay for this film is very much a double edged sword. Like I stated earlier, while the storytelling is very efficient and keeps moving along, I could make the argument that it moves a little too fast. What I mean by that statement is that I felt there were parts of the story that felt incomplete in my mind. For example, the main character has a relationship with this one woman in the chronological end of this story given that the story's told through flashbacks. We only see this certain character for about 10 minutes at most and we are given no reason why she's necessary to the plot. In addition to this, while I felt that we got to knew the Day- Lewis character okay enough, I knew little to nothing about everyone else to the point where I forgot about them. I really had no idea what I thought about this picture immediately after watching it and I still have no idea if I still like or dislike the film even while writing the very review you are reading. While I can't say there's anything really terrible about it and recognize the acting skill behind it, I could also say that there aspects of this film that are completely forgettable. It really is a close call, but in the end, I'm afraid that due to its lack of making an impact on me, I can't recommend My Left Foot.

    My Left Foot is the Irish director Jim Sheridan's first film. It is based on the real life story of Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. His left foot was his only controllable limb, and it was this very left foot that changed his life forever, turning him into a master painter and story teller, thanks to his intelligence and perseverance, and, last but not least, his mother. The film is very touching but it does not fall into the trap of the exaggerated sentimentality that we might see in similar subjects. The film is also realistic; Christy's move from an incomprehensible spastic quadriplegic in a poor family to the respectable painter and writer was not an even path. His constant isolation is felt in his constant drinking, his several failed romances and his strained relations with many of those around him, particularly his father. It is mainly the love for his mother which keeps him going. But in his high moments, he cannot escape the isolation he feels as a result of his physical difference with others. There are a few people who really understand him and those few people become the reason for his happiness in the end. The film has the hopeful message that nothing is impossible if you really believe in yourself and those who care for you. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another dazzling performance as Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. Both won Oscars for their roles.

    Christy Brown (1932-1981) was a famous Irish painter and writer born in a family of 22 children. The fact that he was one of the 13 survivors is pretty ironic considering the severe condition he was born with: cerebral palsy. Christy couldn't control his body as if he was in a perpetual battle between his muscles and his will, but destiny, in all mercifulness, left him one avenue to communicate: his left foot. Would you think it was thin consolation? For Christy, it was enough: he could grab objects, hit the doors and eventually write and paint, express his thoughts, and his torments, for cerebral palsy never affected his capacity to learn, to understand, even to surpass the others' intelligence and sensitivity. "My Left Foot" is the inspirational story of Christy Brown. Christy's struggle starts within his own family where everyone is convinced that he would never be able to get an education, although he's loved and treated like a Brown, he's the cripple of the Family, not to say the retarded. One of the hardest to watch scenes of the film occurs when the father (Ray McAnnaly in his last performance) helps his boy to do his homework and has to find out what a quarter of 25% is. For him, it doesn't make sense since 25% is already a quarter but poor Christy Brown gets the answer and desperately tries to write 1/16 with a piece of chalk between his toes, nobody understands. The scene was frustrating and heartbreaking enough to create a totally opposite feeling when Christy writes M-O-T-H- E-R on the floor, the kids cheer, the father is proud and goes buy a drink, Mrs. Brown is overwhelmed, but not that surprised. Hugh O'Connor delivers a magnificent performance, which I'm sure if it was longer, would have earned him more awards. But behind the obligatory cheers, there are more insightful and more thought-provoking lessons to be learned. Mr. Brown refused to put him in an institution, because it would be a disgrace. At that time, they probably didn't expect him to survive or maybe it would cost money but it's on the basis of this decision that the parents allowed Christy to grow up in a normal background, and not have his inspiration being suffocated by medical assistance. Had Christy been born in a rich family, he wouldn't have become this talented artist, and it's even clearer considering the life he had. Brown was treated equally to his brothers, he was toughened by the street, he played soccer, he drank at pubs, he hit and got hit, he was an Irishman in flesh and blood, and it shows all through the film. The genius of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is to never let the feeling of a one-note personality but on the contrary, convey through his body language, his facial expressions and his burning eyes, a tormenting passion and a ferocious desire to live like everybody and to be loved, he can love but it's all about being loved. The 'love' side is plainly occupied by the other powerful performance of the film, Brenda Fricker (who won the Oscar). She's not just the typical Irish mother, who was pregnant during 16 years (I admit, I counted), she incarnates the capability of a mother to understand her boy. Respect and love are important, but understanding someone is sometimes more valuable. She knows what he feels and even foresees the deceptions. In one movingly intelligent scene, she disapproves Christy's growing affection toward the beautiful doctor Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw). Something isn't right in Christy's voice, too hopeful. Her motherly instinct doesn't fool her because the hope in Christy is quickly destroyed when Eileen reveals that she's going to be married. Daniel Day-Lewis is so powerful that you could literally see his heart being blown into pieces, and the way the situation becomes more and more out of control, reveals a dark, almost creepy, side in his personality, a dependence to alcohol and an almost childish incapability to accept his condition, his heart suffers much more than the body, but who could blame him? The power of "My Left Foot" is to rather take an ordinary look of low-budgeted TV family drama rather than a grandiose Hollywood- type biopic, which fits the tone of the film. But it's definitely the three-dimensional, vibrating and passionate Oscar-winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis that reminds you it's not a TV film. However, the movie is not without a few flaws that don't ruin the overall feeling though. At one scene, the father discovers that his wife was saving money for a wheelchair, we wait for his reaction but then it cuts abruptly to him playing with his kid, tickling him. The mother announces that their daughter is going to marry someone because she's pregnant. Mr. Brown's outburst of rage causes Christy to go into a sort of angry trance, trembling and drooling like a rabid dog, he's eager to kill his father. I thought Christy's reaction was disproportionate regarding an attitude than any father would have, much more in that time. It seemed to me that he was supposed to be a hateful character while he was not. The 'porridge' scene was also confusing because it tried to turn Mr. Brown into a real douche-bag while there were more scenes showing pride than animosity between him and Christy, and nothing to show a sort of complicity between Christy and his sister. Apart from these little details, "My Left Foot" tells a great story, about a great character, it's not perfect, but what the heck: humanity is full of remarkable examples of persons whose talent and hard work allow them to overcame their handicap and to communicate with the rest of the world and if it was not for Jim Sheridan's adaptation of the biographic book "My Left Foot" and for Daniel Day-Lewis' extraordinary performance, many of us wouldn't have heard of Christy Brown.

    I like Daniel Day-Lewis. I get what he was after (not milking our sympathy and giving an accurate portrayal). That said, this movie was boring. Boring. First of all, the storyline is just not that great. I realize it's Christy Brown's life. I don't dispute that he's amazing; nor that his mom was amazing; nor his siblings, who, too, are wonderfully loving. It's just not that great a "plot." Secondly, I can be very emotional, but this movie didn't make me cry, laugh, feel indignant, or teach me any great life lesson. I wasn't inspired, and felt no sense of triumph. Thirdly, watching the movie was like someone saying to me, "Hey, there's this guy I read about with cerebral palsy. All he could control was his left foot, so he wrote and painted with it. His paintings were actually very good, and he typed with his toe." My response? "Wow" (with no exclamation point). Am I interested to hear more? No. Am I glad he told me? Not really. Lastly, Daniel Day-Lewis's acting was so good, that I could understand only 15% of his words. Tough to watch a movie when you can't understand the main character. Give me a break. This may be the case with some individuals with severe CP (but not with my CP friends, 90% of whose words I understand), but even if it were the case for Christy Brown, I mean--come on--I'm watching a movie here. Make me a concession. I know, I know. If he were my brother, I'd have to learn. But this is a movie. I've got two hours, not a background of twelve years listening to this guy and thereby learning to understand him. Speak understandably, DDL, for the sake of the movie viewers; we'll still get your point. DDL's unclear speech causes one to try to figure out through the whole movie what he's just said by the context of how everyone else in the movie responds. Let me understand his words. Speak so that I can. Ugghhh.

    Wonderful movie, Christy Brown is as cripple as Hamlet. He was not "Nothing" so he chose not to end his life. We love his high spirited hopefulness and his refusal to be a vegetable. Millions are mentally and creativity wise more cripple than Christy Brown. The movie depicts the protagonist fighting a great war against outside circumstances ( being a cripple ) and inside world - a desire to make his mark in spite of his apparent inability to create specially in the situation when most around him thought that he was nothing more than a vegetable. I feel Christy Brown represents the modern man struggling against the hostile world without and within. The support of the family, specially the mother figure represents the only hope that we have got - the fellow human beings. Daniel Day Lewis rightly earned his Oscar for his performance. Simply the best.

    My Left Foot: The Story of Christy Brown is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very impressive cast.I thought this movie would be incredible but in wasn't nearly as good as I expected.I found it very boring at times,but Daniel Day-Lewis really made this movie what it is,his acting is incredible and inspired and he deserved the Academy Award for his performance,but I don't think Brenda Fricker did,I didn't find her performance that impressive.The movie did tell us the story of Christy Brown perfectly and put us in his position all the way through,but I am Irish,and I thought this movie would make me feel very proud of my country,other than Daniel Day-Lewis,it didn't really.If you enjoy dramatic biography movies and Daniel Day-Lewis,this movie certainly is a must see,but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it would. Adaption of Christy Brown's autobiography of how he overcame cerebral palsy to become an artist and author.

    This film is about the life of Christy Brown--a man who, despite being almost completely disabled, was able to make something of himself and prove that every life is of value. When he was born in 1932, doctors recommended to his parents that Christy be placed in a home for the disabled--in other words, a 'warehouse' where he would have been dumped. However, despite his severe cerebral palsy, his parents brought him home and raised him despite the odds--a real oddity for that period of time. The story follows Christy from his birth until has later years when he eventually gained fame for his art as well as his autobiography, "My Left Foot"--named that because it was his only usable limb. When you watch the film, you will marvel at the acting. While Daniel Day-Lewis received the Oscar for his great and very realistic portrayal of Brown, I am not sure why the child who played Brown as a child didn't get some sort of recognition--as he was great also. And, I especially appreciated it because too often child actors are, to put it bluntly, terrible. Yet, Hugh O'Conor was every bit as wonderful as Day-Lewis. On the other hand, once again, the history teacher in me strikes again. As I watched this biopic about the Irish author/painter Christy Brown, I couldn't help but feel a bit annoyed that the ending painted a completely false picture of the man's final years. In this Hollywood-like ending, Brown apparently has a very happy final years. However, this was NOT at all true---and his final years were quite pathetic--filled with alcoholism and an an early death. I really don't think the film needed the happy ending and knocked a point off for this. Still, overall an exceptional film--one well worth your time.

    If I were to heavily praise 'My Left Foot', there would be a 95% chance that I'd be heavily complimenting the astonishing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis more than anything. It is a great story with some excellent writing based on a very inspirational man named Christy Brown, but said man is captured so expertly by Day-Lewis that everything else great about the movie is easily ignored. Regarded as being one of the most 'real' actors of all-time, Daniel Day- Lewis reportedly stayed in character throughout the filming process, some may criticize the approach, but when you watch him on the screen, you can tell that all the hard work paid off to the fullest extent. He captures the discomfort, frustration and loneliness of a man with cerebral palsy, and the passion of a man labelled as 'gifted' but is far more 'gifted' than people really know. From top to bottom, 'My Left Foot' is a huge recommendation for any movie fan, and a definite must-see for any aspiring actor.

    My Left Foot was released in 1989, and likely contained the best acting of that year. I was extremely excited to watch this movie after just seeing Lincoln and realizing what an amazing actor Daniel Day-Lewis is. Besides this and Lincoln, he has also won an Oscar for There Will Be Blood, which I intend to see as soon as possible. It is an older movie, so the quality and style of filmmaking has since changed, but it was still a very good watch. This is an actor's movie. More specifically, this is Daniel Day-Lewis' movie. His work in this is absolutely remarkable, with the way that he completely immersed himself in the role. He plays Christy Brown, a man born with Cerebral Palsy, who is only able to move his neck and his left foot (more like his left leg actually.) This alone is an incredible task on Daniel Day-Lewis' part, having to confine his acting to almost complete paralysis, while gaining remarkable control of his foot, but he also had the inability to talk. Halfway through the film, a character comes in and teaches him to speak, but even after that his voice is very unclear. This was an almost impossible role for anyone to take on, but he was committed enough the he was able to very successfully play it. Through his incredible method of becoming his character rather than portraying it, he was able to take this character where nobody else could. In fact, during the filming of this movie, he hired someone to wheel him around in a wheelchair so that he could remain in character during and away from filming. Supporting actors are rather difficult to concentrate on in a movie like this, but Brenda Fricker, who played Christy Brown's loving and loyal mother, gave a very good performance, winning herself an Oscar. However, Daniel Day-Lewis was the focus of this movie, and he has proved himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and definitely my favorite. Jim Sheridan, who has been nominated for six Oscars (two for my Left Foot,) wrote and directed this picture. Frankly, I was rather disappointed with the movie as a whole. The story was a little random with which parts of his life that they decided to show. There were many times when I was ready to move on to later in his life, or content and wanting more of the time I was in. I also would have preferred for it to have been a little longer, it was only one hundred minutes, which is rather short for a live-action film, and especially a biography. Mainly, I just felt that I hadn't seen enough of Christy Brown when the movie finished, when honestly I could have watched Daniel Day-Lewis' performance for many hours before getting tired or bored. I wasn't at all impressed with the directing in this movie, but Daniel Day-Lewis' transformation into Christy Brown was in the end what made this movie an incredible watch. I was torn with this film, I was very disappointed by the directing and writing, but was completely blown away by the acting. Thankfully, I prefer to weigh goods over bads, so after all I loved this movie. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supportig Actress, along with three unsuccessful nominations for Adapted Screenplay, Directing, and Best Picture. I give this movie a disappointed but pleased 8/10.

The film has the hopeful message that nothing is impossible if you really believe in yourself and those who care for you. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another dazzling performance as Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. Both won Oscars for their roles.

    Christy Brown (1932-1981) was a famous Irish painter and writer born in a family of 22 children. The fact that he was one of the 13 survivors is pretty ironic considering the severe condition he was born with: cerebral palsy. Christy couldn't control his body as if he was in a perpetual battle between his muscles and his will, but destiny, in all mercifulness, left him one avenue to communicate: his left foot. Would you think it was thin consolation? For Christy, it was enough: he could grab objects, hit the doors and eventually write and paint, express his thoughts, and his torments, for cerebral palsy never affected his capacity to learn, to understand, even to surpass the others' intelligence and sensitivity. "My Left Foot" is the inspirational story of Christy Brown. Christy's struggle starts within his own family where everyone is convinced that he would never be able to get an education, although he's loved and treated like a Brown, he's the cripple of the Family, not to say the retarded. One of the hardest to watch scenes of the film occurs when the father (Ray McAnnaly in his last performance) helps his boy to do his homework and has to find out what a quarter of 25% is. For him, it doesn't make sense since 25% is already a quarter but poor Christy Brown gets the answer and desperately tries to write 1/16 with a piece of chalk between his toes, nobody understands. The scene was frustrating and heartbreaking enough to create a totally opposite feeling when Christy writes M-O-T-H- E-R on the floor, the kids cheer, the father is proud and goes buy a drink, Mrs. Brown is overwhelmed, but not that surprised. Hugh O'Connor delivers a magnificent performance, which I'm sure if it was longer, would have earned him more awards. But behind the obligatory cheers, there are more insightful and more thought-provoking lessons to be learned. Mr. Brown refused to put him in an institution, because it would be a disgrace. At that time, they probably didn't expect him to survive or maybe it would cost money but it's on the basis of this decision that the parents allowed Christy to grow up in a normal background, and not have his inspiration being suffocated by medical assistance. Had Christy been born in a rich family, he wouldn't have become this talented artist, and it's even clearer considering the life he had. Brown was treated equally to his brothers, he was toughened by the street, he played soccer, he drank at pubs, he hit and got hit, he was an Irishman in flesh and blood, and it shows all through the film. The genius of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is to never let the feeling of a one-note personality but on the contrary, convey through his body language, his facial expressions and his burning eyes, a tormenting passion and a ferocious desire to live like everybody and to be loved, he can love but it's all about being loved. The 'love' side is plainly occupied by the other powerful performance of the film, Brenda Fricker (who won the Oscar). She's not just the typical Irish mother, who was pregnant during 16 years (I admit, I counted), she incarnates the capability of a mother to understand her boy. Respect and love are important, but understanding someone is sometimes more valuable. She knows what he feels and even foresees the deceptions. In one movingly intelligent scene, she disapproves Christy's growing affection toward the beautiful doctor Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw). Something isn't right in Christy's voice, too hopeful. Her motherly instinct doesn't fool her because the hope in Christy is quickly destroyed when Eileen reveals that she's going to be married. Daniel Day-Lewis is so powerful that you could literally see his heart being blown into pieces, and the way the situation becomes more and more out of control, reveals a dark, almost creepy, side in his personality, a dependence to alcohol and an almost childish incapability to accept his condition, his heart suffers much more than the body, but who could blame him? The power of "My Left Foot" is to rather take an ordinary look of low-budgeted TV family drama rather than a grandiose Hollywood- type biopic, which fits the tone of the film. But it's definitely the three-dimensional, vibrating and passionate Oscar-winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis that reminds you it's not a TV film. However, the movie is not without a few flaws that don't ruin the overall feeling though. At one scene, the father discovers that his wife was saving money for a wheelchair, we wait for his reaction but then it cuts abruptly to him playing with his kid, tickling him. The mother announces that their daughter is going to marry someone because she's pregnant. Mr. Brown's outburst of rage causes Christy to go into a sort of angry trance, trembling and drooling like a rabid dog, he's eager to kill his father. I thought Christy's reaction was disproportionate regarding an attitude than any father would have, much more in that time. It seemed to me that he was supposed to be a hateful character while he was not. The 'porridge' scene was also confusing because it tried to turn Mr. Brown into a real douche-bag while there were more scenes showing pride than animosity between him and Christy, and nothing to show a sort of complicity between Christy and his sister. Apart from these little details, "My Left Foot" tells a great story, about a great character, it's not perfect, but what the heck: humanity is full of remarkable examples of persons whose talent and hard work allow them to overcame their handicap and to communicate with the rest of the world and if it was not for Jim Sheridan's adaptation of the biographic book "My Left Foot" and for Daniel Day-Lewis' extraordinary performance, many of us wouldn't have heard of Christy Brown.

    I like Daniel Day-Lewis. I get what he was after (not milking our sympathy and giving an accurate portrayal). That said, this movie was boring. Boring. First of all, the storyline is just not that great. I realize it's Christy Brown's life. I don't dispute that he's amazing; nor that his mom was amazing; nor his siblings, who, too, are wonderfully loving. It's just not that great a "plot." Secondly, I can be very emotional, but this movie didn't make me cry, laugh, feel indignant, or teach me any great life lesson. I wasn't inspired, and felt no sense of triumph. Thirdly, watching the movie was like someone saying to me, "Hey, there's this guy I read about with cerebral palsy. All he could control was his left foot, so he wrote and painted with it. His paintings were actually very good, and he typed with his toe." My response? "Wow" (with no exclamation point). Am I interested to hear more? No. Am I glad he told me? Not really. Lastly, Daniel Day-Lewis's acting was so good, that I could understand only 15% of his words. Tough to watch a movie when you can't understand the main character. Give me a break. This may be the case with some individuals with severe CP (but not with my CP friends, 90% of whose words I understand), but even if it were the case for Christy Brown, I mean--come on--I'm watching a movie here. Make me a concession. I know, I know. If he were my brother, I'd have to learn. But this is a movie. I've got two hours, not a background of twelve years listening to this guy and thereby learning to understand him. Speak understandably, DDL, for the sake of the movie viewers; we'll still get your point. DDL's unclear speech causes one to try to figure out through the whole movie what he's just said by the context of how everyone else in the movie responds. Let me understand his words. Speak so that I can. Ugghhh.

    Wonderful movie, Christy Brown is as cripple as Hamlet. He was not "Nothing" so he chose not to end his life. We love his high spirited hopefulness and his refusal to be a vegetable. Millions are mentally and creativity wise more cripple than Christy Brown. The movie depicts the protagonist fighting a great war against outside circumstances ( being a cripple ) and inside world - a desire to make his mark in spite of his apparent inability to create specially in the situation when most around him thought that he was nothing more than a vegetable. I feel Christy Brown represents the modern man struggling against the hostile world without and within. The support of the family, specially the mother figure represents the only hope that we have got - the fellow human beings. Daniel Day Lewis rightly earned his Oscar for his performance. Simply the best.

    My Left Foot: The Story of Christy Brown is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a very impressive cast.I thought this movie would be incredible but in wasn't nearly as good as I expected.I found it very boring at times,but Daniel Day-Lewis really made this movie what it is,his acting is incredible and inspired and he deserved the Academy Award for his performance,but I don't think Brenda Fricker did,I didn't find her performance that impressive.The movie did tell us the story of Christy Brown perfectly and put us in his position all the way through,but I am Irish,and I thought this movie would make me feel very proud of my country,other than Daniel Day-Lewis,it didn't really.If you enjoy dramatic biography movies and Daniel Day-Lewis,this movie certainly is a must see,but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it would. Adaption of Christy Brown's autobiography of how he overcame cerebral palsy to become an artist and author.

    This film is about the life of Christy Brown--a man who, despite being almost completely disabled, was able to make something of himself and prove that every life is of value. When he was born in 1932, doctors recommended to his parents that Christy be placed in a home for the disabled--in other words, a 'warehouse' where he would have been dumped. However, despite his severe cerebral palsy, his parents brought him home and raised him despite the odds--a real oddity for that period of time. The story follows Christy from his birth until has later years when he eventually gained fame for his art as well as his autobiography, "My Left Foot"--named that because it was his only usable limb. When you watch the film, you will marvel at the acting. While Daniel Day-Lewis received the Oscar for his great and very realistic portrayal of Brown, I am not sure why the child who played Brown as a child didn't get some sort of recognition--as he was great also. And, I especially appreciated it because too often child actors are, to put it bluntly, terrible. Yet, Hugh O'Conor was every bit as wonderful as Day-Lewis. On the other hand, once again, the history teacher in me strikes again. As I watched this biopic about the Irish author/painter Christy Brown, I couldn't help but feel a bit annoyed that the ending painted a completely false picture of the man's final years. In this Hollywood-like ending, Brown apparently has a very happy final years. However, this was NOT at all true---and his final years were quite pathetic--filled with alcoholism and an an early death. I really don't think the film needed the happy ending and knocked a point off for this. Still, overall an exceptional film--one well worth your time.

    If I were to heavily praise 'My Left Foot', there would be a 95% chance that I'd be heavily complimenting the astonishing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis more than anything. It is a great story with some excellent writing based on a very inspirational man named Christy Brown, but said man is captured so expertly by Day-Lewis that everything else great about the movie is easily ignored. Regarded as being one of the most 'real' actors of all-time, Daniel Day- Lewis reportedly stayed in character throughout the filming process, some may criticize the approach, but when you watch him on the screen, you can tell that all the hard work paid off to the fullest extent. He captures the discomfort, frustration and loneliness of a man with cerebral palsy, and the passion of a man labelled as 'gifted' but is far more 'gifted' than people really know. From top to bottom, 'My Left Foot' is a huge recommendation for any movie fan, and a definite must-see for any aspiring actor.

    My Left Foot was released in 1989, and likely contained the best acting of that year. I was extremely excited to watch this movie after just seeing Lincoln and realizing what an amazing actor Daniel Day-Lewis is. Besides this and Lincoln, he has also won an Oscar for There Will Be Blood, which I intend to see as soon as possible. It is an older movie, so the quality and style of filmmaking has since changed, but it was still a very good watch. This is an actor's movie. More specifically, this is Daniel Day-Lewis' movie. His work in this is absolutely remarkable, with the way that he completely immersed himself in the role. He plays Christy Brown, a man born with Cerebral Palsy, who is only able to move his neck and his left foot (more like his left leg actually.) This alone is an incredible task on Daniel Day-Lewis' part, having to confine his acting to almost complete paralysis, while gaining remarkable control of his foot, but he also had the inability to talk. Halfway through the film, a character comes in and teaches him to speak, but even after that his voice is very unclear. This was an almost impossible role for anyone to take on, but he was committed enough the he was able to very successfully play it. Through his incredible method of becoming his character rather than portraying it, he was able to take this character where nobody else could. In fact, during the filming of this movie, he hired someone to wheel him around in a wheelchair so that he could remain in character during and away from filming. Supporting actors are rather difficult to concentrate on in a movie like this, but Brenda Fricker, who played Christy Brown's loving and loyal mother, gave a very good performance, winning herself an Oscar. However, Daniel Day-Lewis was the focus of this movie, and he has proved himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and definitely my favorite. Jim Sheridan, who has been nominated for six Oscars (two for my Left Foot,) wrote and directed this picture. Frankly, I was rather disappointed with the movie as a whole. The story was a little random with which parts of his life that they decided to show. There were many times when I was ready to move on to later in his life, or content and wanting more of the time I was in. I also would have preferred for it to have been a little longer, it was only one hundred minutes, which is rather short for a live-action film, and especially a biography. Mainly, I just felt that I hadn't seen enough of Christy Brown when the movie finished, when honestly I could have watched Daniel Day-Lewis' performance for many hours before getting tired or bored. I wasn't at all impressed with the directing in this movie, but Daniel Day-Lewis' transformation into Christy Brown was in the end what made this movie an incredible watch. I was torn with this film, I was very disappointed by the directing and writing, but was completely blown away by the acting. Thankfully, I prefer to weigh goods over bads, so after all I loved this movie. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supportig Actress, along with three unsuccessful nominations for Adapted Screenplay, Directing, and Best Picture. I give this movie a disappointed but pleased 8/10.

    This is based on the autobiography of Christy Brown, a man born with a cerebral palsy, and had to learn how to do things through the only limb that he had control over, and that limb was the title object, his left foot. This film is truly an outstanding movie, it's a masterpiece, one of the best movies of 1989, and even one of the best movies of all time. When I started to watch this film, I didn't expect to see what I saw, I was expecting to see a movie with good acting and good storytelling and writing. THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENY MY FRIENDS! This movie is one of the most wonderful movies ever to play on my television set, it's a wonderful and touching true story of a man who was able to become a success with his only controllable limb. This is a great feel good movie, and it is one of the best movies to portray somebody with a cerebral palsy. One problem I have with this film is that I wish that the real Christy Brown would have lived to see this movie, because he would have been absolutely astounded at how accurately Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed him. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our time, and here, he is sublime (well, he usually is sublime in just about every movie that he's in). Like his role in In The Name Of The Father, his performance in this film is like no Daniel Day-Lewis performance I've ever seen. When I saw this film, I could have sworn that Daniel Day-Lewis WAS Christy Brown, and I could have sworn that he had a cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis couldn't have possibly done a better job than he did already, he was outstanding beyond words, and he deserved the Academy Award For Best Actor, his first of three wins (he would win two more for There Will Be Blood in 2007, and most recently, Lincoln in 2012). Brenda Fricker also won an Oscar, she would the award for Best Supporting Actress, which was also a well deserved win. As great a job as the rest of the cast did, none of them were as outstanding as Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives one of the best film performances of any movie that I have ever seen, a distinction that I rarely award to actors in movies. So all in all, this is truly an outstanding movie, and it features one of the greatest actors of our time, giving a role that is one of the best performances of any movie. Daniel Day-Lewis has made many great movies, such as There Will Be Blood, Gangs Of New York, and In The Name Of The Father, but My Left Foot is his best performance, he was beyond outstanding, when it came to acting, he was in a class by himself, a level of greatness higher than the highest! Okay, that sounds a little odd, but you'll probably get the point. What makes Daniel Day-Lewis outstanding is probably the fact that he is very selective with what he chooses, I mean that since 1997, he's been in only five movies. But hey, that's a good thing, because there's a good chance that the movie is going to be excellent. But getting back to this film, you've definitely got to see it, you will not believe your eyes when you watch this. When this movie has ended, you will say that you have just viewed one of the greatest movies ever made, as that is exactly what this movie is. 10/10

    The best way to describe a film like Jim Sheridan's 1989 drama My Left Foot is that it is a film that satisfies and dissatisfies both at the same time. On one hand, it does what it's supposed to do which is look into the life of the story's main character. On the other hand, I felt that something about this story was missing and I ended up really wanting much more than what I got. Let's focus on what's good about this film first and foremost: Daniel Day-Lewis himself. No one else but Daniel Day-Lewis could have successfully pulled off the role of a disabled Irishman who can only move with his left foot and yet become an inspiring artist. The way that he disappears into his character and convinces us that he has these physical and mental struggles is nothing short of expertly done. Daniel Day-Lewis isn't the only cast member of this picture that delivers impressive acting, Brenda Fricker is also exceptional as his mother who tries her best to figure out how to take care of her son. Fiona Shaw is also pretty decent as a doctor who forms a special bond with the main character. These three performances are basically the best aspect of this film. Despite that praise, I feel that the storytelling and screenplay for this film is very much a double edged sword. Like I stated earlier, while the storytelling is very efficient and keeps moving along, I could make the argument that it moves a little too fast. What I mean by that statement is that I felt there were parts of the story that felt incomplete in my mind. For example, the main character has a relationship with this one woman in the chronological end of this story given that the story's told through flashbacks. We only see this certain character for about 10 minutes at most and we are given no reason why she's necessary to the plot. In addition to this, while I felt that we got to knew the Day- Lewis character okay enough, I knew little to nothing about everyone else to the point where I forgot about them. I really had no idea what I thought about this picture immediately after watching it and I still have no idea if I still like or dislike the film even while writing the very review you are reading. While I can't say there's anything really terrible about it and recognize the acting skill behind it, I could also say that there aspects of this film that are completely forgettable. It really is a close call, but in the end, I'm afraid that due to its lack of making an impact on me, I can't recommend My Left Foot.

    My Left Foot is the Irish director Jim Sheridan's first film. It is based on the real life story of Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. His left foot was his only controllable limb, and it was this very left foot that changed his life forever, turning him into a master painter and story teller, thanks to his intelligence and perseverance, and, last but not least, his mother. The film is very touching but it does not fall into the trap of the exaggerated sentimentality that we might see in similar subjects. The film is also realistic; Christy's move from an incomprehensible spastic quadriplegic in a poor family to the respectable painter and writer was not an even path. His constant isolation is felt in his constant drinking, his several failed romances and his strained relations with many of those around him, particularly his father. It is mainly the love for his mother which keeps him going. But in his high moments, he cannot escape the isolation he feels as a result of his physical difference with others. There are a few people who really understand him and those few people become the reason for his happiness in the end. The film has the hopeful message that nothing is impossible if you really believe in yourself and those who care for you. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another dazzling performance as Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. Both won Oscars for their roles.

"My Left Foot" is the inspirational story of Christy Brown. Christy's struggle starts within his own family where everyone is convinced that he would never be able to get an education, although he's loved and treated like a Brown, he's the cripple of the Family, not to say the retarded. One of the hardest to watch scenes of the film occurs when the father (Ray McAnnaly in his last performance) helps his boy to do his homework and has to find out what a quarter of 25% is. For him, it doesn't make sense since 25% is already a quarter but poor Christy Brown gets the answer and desperately tries to write 1/16 with a piece of chalk between his toes, nobody understands. The scene was frustrating and heartbreaking enough to create a totally opposite feeling when Christy writes M-O-T-H- E-R on the floor, the kids cheer, the father is proud and goes buy a drink, Mrs. Brown is overwhelmed, but not that surprised.

First of all, the storyline is just not that great. I realize it's Christy Brown's life. I don't dispute that he's amazing; nor that his mom was amazing; nor his siblings, who, too, are wonderfully loving. It's just not that great a "plot." Secondly, I can be very emotional, but this movie didn't make me cry, laugh, feel indignant, or teach me any great life lesson. I wasn't inspired, and felt no sense of triumph. Thirdly, watching the movie was like someone saying to me, "Hey, there's this guy I read about with cerebral palsy. All he could control was his left foot, so he wrote and painted with it. His paintings were actually very good, and he typed with his toe." My response? "Wow" (with no exclamation point). Am I interested to hear more? No. Am I glad he told me? Not really. Lastly, Daniel Day-Lewis's acting was so good, that I could understand only 15% of his words. Tough to watch a movie when you can't understand the main character. Give me a break. This may be the case with some individuals with severe CP (but not with my CP friends, 90% of whose words I understand), but even if it were the case for Christy Brown, I mean--come on--I'm watching a movie here. Make me a concession. I know, I know. If he were my brother, I'd have to learn. But this is a movie. I've got two hours, not a background of twelve years listening to this guy and thereby learning to understand him. Speak understandably, DDL, for the sake of the movie viewers; we'll still get your point. DDL's unclear speech causes one to try to figure out through the whole movie what he's just said by the context of how everyone else in the movie responds. Let me understand his words. Speak so that I can. Ugghhh.

    Wonderful movie, Christy Brown is as cripple as Hamlet. He was not "Nothing" so he chose not to end his life. We love his high spirited hopefulness and his refusal to be a vegetable. Millions are mentally and creativity wise more cripple than Christy Brown. The movie depicts the protagonist fighting a great war against outside circumstances ( being a cripple ) and inside world - a desire to make his mark in spite of his apparent inability to create specially in the situation when most around him thought that he was nothing more than a vegetable. I feel Christy Brown represents the modern man struggling against the hostile world without and within. The support of the family, specially the mother figure represents the only hope that we have got - the fellow human beings. Daniel Day Lewis rightly earned his Oscar for his performance. Simply the best.

    This film is about the life of Christy Brown--a man who, despite being almost completely disabled, was able to make something of himself and prove that every life is of value. When he was born in 1932, doctors recommended to his parents that Christy be placed in a home for the disabled--in other words, a 'warehouse' where he would have been dumped. However, despite his severe cerebral palsy, his parents brought him home and raised him despite the odds--a real oddity for that period of time. The story follows Christy from his birth until has later years when he eventually gained fame for his art as well as his autobiography, "My Left Foot"--named that because it was his only usable limb. When you watch the film, you will marvel at the acting. While Daniel Day-Lewis received the Oscar for his great and very realistic portrayal of Brown, I am not sure why the child who played Brown as a child didn't get some sort of recognition--as he was great also. And, I especially appreciated it because too often child actors are, to put it bluntly, terrible. Yet, Hugh O'Conor was every bit as wonderful as Day-Lewis. On the other hand, once again, the history teacher in me strikes again. As I watched this biopic about the Irish author/painter Christy Brown, I couldn't help but feel a bit annoyed that the ending painted a completely false picture of the man's final years. In this Hollywood-like ending, Brown apparently has a very happy final years. However, this was NOT at all true---and his final years were quite pathetic--filled with alcoholism and an an early death. I really don't think the film needed the happy ending and knocked a point off for this. Still, overall an exceptional film--one well worth your time.

    If I were to heavily praise 'My Left Foot', there would be a 95% chance that I'd be heavily complimenting the astonishing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis more than anything. It is a great story with some excellent writing based on a very inspirational man named Christy Brown, but said man is captured so expertly by Day-Lewis that everything else great about the movie is easily ignored. Regarded as being one of the most 'real' actors of all-time, Daniel Day- Lewis reportedly stayed in character throughout the filming process, some may criticize the approach, but when you watch him on the screen, you can tell that all the hard work paid off to the fullest extent. He captures the discomfort, frustration and loneliness of a man with cerebral palsy, and the passion of a man labelled as 'gifted' but is far more 'gifted' than people really know. From top to bottom, 'My Left Foot' is a huge recommendation for any movie fan, and a definite must-see for any aspiring actor.

    My Left Foot was released in 1989, and likely contained the best acting of that year. I was extremely excited to watch this movie after just seeing Lincoln and realizing what an amazing actor Daniel Day-Lewis is. Besides this and Lincoln, he has also won an Oscar for There Will Be Blood, which I intend to see as soon as possible. It is an older movie, so the quality and style of filmmaking has since changed, but it was still a very good watch. This is an actor's movie. More specifically, this is Daniel Day-Lewis' movie. His work in this is absolutely remarkable, with the way that he completely immersed himself in the role. He plays Christy Brown, a man born with Cerebral Palsy, who is only able to move his neck and his left foot (more like his left leg actually.) This alone is an incredible task on Daniel Day-Lewis' part, having to confine his acting to almost complete paralysis, while gaining remarkable control of his foot, but he also had the inability to talk. Halfway through the film, a character comes in and teaches him to speak, but even after that his voice is very unclear. This was an almost impossible role for anyone to take on, but he was committed enough the he was able to very successfully play it. Through his incredible method of becoming his character rather than portraying it, he was able to take this character where nobody else could. In fact, during the filming of this movie, he hired someone to wheel him around in a wheelchair so that he could remain in character during and away from filming. Supporting actors are rather difficult to concentrate on in a movie like this, but Brenda Fricker, who played Christy Brown's loving and loyal mother, gave a very good performance, winning herself an Oscar. However, Daniel Day-Lewis was the focus of this movie, and he has proved himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and definitely my favorite. Jim Sheridan, who has been nominated for six Oscars (two for my Left Foot,) wrote and directed this picture. Frankly, I was rather disappointed with the movie as a whole. The story was a little random with which parts of his life that they decided to show. There were many times when I was ready to move on to later in his life, or content and wanting more of the time I was in. I also would have preferred for it to have been a little longer, it was only one hundred minutes, which is rather short for a live-action film, and especially a biography. Mainly, I just felt that I hadn't seen enough of Christy Brown when the movie finished, when honestly I could have watched Daniel Day-Lewis' performance for many hours before getting tired or bored. I wasn't at all impressed with the directing in this movie, but Daniel Day-Lewis' transformation into Christy Brown was in the end what made this movie an incredible watch. I was torn with this film, I was very disappointed by the directing and writing, but was completely blown away by the acting. Thankfully, I prefer to weigh goods over bads, so after all I loved this movie. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supportig Actress, along with three unsuccessful nominations for Adapted Screenplay, Directing, and Best Picture. I give this movie a disappointed but pleased 8/10.

    This is based on the autobiography of Christy Brown, a man born with a cerebral palsy, and had to learn how to do things through the only limb that he had control over, and that limb was the title object, his left foot. This film is truly an outstanding movie, it's a masterpiece, one of the best movies of 1989, and even one of the best movies of all time. When I started to watch this film, I didn't expect to see what I saw, I was expecting to see a movie with good acting and good storytelling and writing. THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENY MY FRIENDS! This movie is one of the most wonderful movies ever to play on my television set, it's a wonderful and touching true story of a man who was able to become a success with his only controllable limb. This is a great feel good movie, and it is one of the best movies to portray somebody with a cerebral palsy. One problem I have with this film is that I wish that the real Christy Brown would have lived to see this movie, because he would have been absolutely astounded at how accurately Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed him. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our time, and here, he is sublime (well, he usually is sublime in just about every movie that he's in). Like his role in In The Name Of The Father, his performance in this film is like no Daniel Day-Lewis performance I've ever seen. When I saw this film, I could have sworn that Daniel Day-Lewis WAS Christy Brown, and I could have sworn that he had a cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis couldn't have possibly done a better job than he did already, he was outstanding beyond words, and he deserved the Academy Award For Best Actor, his first of three wins (he would win two more for There Will Be Blood in 2007, and most recently, Lincoln in 2012). Brenda Fricker also won an Oscar, she would the award for Best Supporting Actress, which was also a well deserved win. As great a job as the rest of the cast did, none of them were as outstanding as Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives one of the best film performances of any movie that I have ever seen, a distinction that I rarely award to actors in movies. So all in all, this is truly an outstanding movie, and it features one of the greatest actors of our time, giving a role that is one of the best performances of any movie. Daniel Day-Lewis has made many great movies, such as There Will Be Blood, Gangs Of New York, and In The Name Of The Father, but My Left Foot is his best performance, he was beyond outstanding, when it came to acting, he was in a class by himself, a level of greatness higher than the highest! Okay, that sounds a little odd, but you'll probably get the point. What makes Daniel Day-Lewis outstanding is probably the fact that he is very selective with what he chooses, I mean that since 1997, he's been in only five movies. But hey, that's a good thing, because there's a good chance that the movie is going to be excellent. But getting back to this film, you've definitely got to see it, you will not believe your eyes when you watch this. When this movie has ended, you will say that you have just viewed one of the greatest movies ever made, as that is exactly what this movie is. 10/10

    The best way to describe a film like Jim Sheridan's 1989 drama My Left Foot is that it is a film that satisfies and dissatisfies both at the same time. On one hand, it does what it's supposed to do which is look into the life of the story's main character. On the other hand, I felt that something about this story was missing and I ended up really wanting much more than what I got. Let's focus on what's good about this film first and foremost: Daniel Day-Lewis himself. No one else but Daniel Day-Lewis could have successfully pulled off the role of a disabled Irishman who can only move with his left foot and yet become an inspiring artist. The way that he disappears into his character and convinces us that he has these physical and mental struggles is nothing short of expertly done. Daniel Day-Lewis isn't the only cast member of this picture that delivers impressive acting, Brenda Fricker is also exceptional as his mother who tries her best to figure out how to take care of her son. Fiona Shaw is also pretty decent as a doctor who forms a special bond with the main character. These three performances are basically the best aspect of this film. Despite that praise, I feel that the storytelling and screenplay for this film is very much a double edged sword. Like I stated earlier, while the storytelling is very efficient and keeps moving along, I could make the argument that it moves a little too fast. What I mean by that statement is that I felt there were parts of the story that felt incomplete in my mind. For example, the main character has a relationship with this one woman in the chronological end of this story given that the story's told through flashbacks. We only see this certain character for about 10 minutes at most and we are given no reason why she's necessary to the plot. In addition to this, while I felt that we got to knew the Day- Lewis character okay enough, I knew little to nothing about everyone else to the point where I forgot about them. I really had no idea what I thought about this picture immediately after watching it and I still have no idea if I still like or dislike the film even while writing the very review you are reading. While I can't say there's anything really terrible about it and recognize the acting skill behind it, I could also say that there aspects of this film that are completely forgettable. It really is a close call, but in the end, I'm afraid that due to its lack of making an impact on me, I can't recommend My Left Foot.

    My Left Foot is the Irish director Jim Sheridan's first film. It is based on the real life story of Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. His left foot was his only controllable limb, and it was this very left foot that changed his life forever, turning him into a master painter and story teller, thanks to his intelligence and perseverance, and, last but not least, his mother. The film is very touching but it does not fall into the trap of the exaggerated sentimentality that we might see in similar subjects. The film is also realistic; Christy's move from an incomprehensible spastic quadriplegic in a poor family to the respectable painter and writer was not an even path. His constant isolation is felt in his constant drinking, his several failed romances and his strained relations with many of those around him, particularly his father. It is mainly the love for his mother which keeps him going. But in his high moments, he cannot escape the isolation he feels as a result of his physical difference with others. There are a few people who really understand him and those few people become the reason for his happiness in the end. The film has the hopeful message that nothing is impossible if you really believe in yourself and those who care for you. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another dazzling performance as Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. Both won Oscars for their roles.

    Christy Brown (1932-1981) was a famous Irish painter and writer born in a family of 22 children. The fact that he was one of the 13 survivors is pretty ironic considering the severe condition he was born with: cerebral palsy. Christy couldn't control his body as if he was in a perpetual battle between his muscles and his will, but destiny, in all mercifulness, left him one avenue to communicate: his left foot. Would you think it was thin consolation? For Christy, it was enough: he could grab objects, hit the doors and eventually write and paint, express his thoughts, and his torments, for cerebral palsy never affected his capacity to learn, to understand, even to surpass the others' intelligence and sensitivity. "My Left Foot" is the inspirational story of Christy Brown. Christy's struggle starts within his own family where everyone is convinced that he would never be able to get an education, although he's loved and treated like a Brown, he's the cripple of the Family, not to say the retarded. One of the hardest to watch scenes of the film occurs when the father (Ray McAnnaly in his last performance) helps his boy to do his homework and has to find out what a quarter of 25% is. For him, it doesn't make sense since 25% is already a quarter but poor Christy Brown gets the answer and desperately tries to write 1/16 with a piece of chalk between his toes, nobody understands. The scene was frustrating and heartbreaking enough to create a totally opposite feeling when Christy writes M-O-T-H- E-R on the floor, the kids cheer, the father is proud and goes buy a drink, Mrs. Brown is overwhelmed, but not that surprised. Hugh O'Connor delivers a magnificent performance, which I'm sure if it was longer, would have earned him more awards. But behind the obligatory cheers, there are more insightful and more thought-provoking lessons to be learned. Mr. Brown refused to put him in an institution, because it would be a disgrace. At that time, they probably didn't expect him to survive or maybe it would cost money but it's on the basis of this decision that the parents allowed Christy to grow up in a normal background, and not have his inspiration being suffocated by medical assistance. Had Christy been born in a rich family, he wouldn't have become this talented artist, and it's even clearer considering the life he had. Brown was treated equally to his brothers, he was toughened by the street, he played soccer, he drank at pubs, he hit and got hit, he was an Irishman in flesh and blood, and it shows all through the film. The genius of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is to never let the feeling of a one-note personality but on the contrary, convey through his body language, his facial expressions and his burning eyes, a tormenting passion and a ferocious desire to live like everybody and to be loved, he can love but it's all about being loved. The 'love' side is plainly occupied by the other powerful performance of the film, Brenda Fricker (who won the Oscar). She's not just the typical Irish mother, who was pregnant during 16 years (I admit, I counted), she incarnates the capability of a mother to understand her boy. Respect and love are important, but understanding someone is sometimes more valuable. She knows what he feels and even foresees the deceptions. In one movingly intelligent scene, she disapproves Christy's growing affection toward the beautiful doctor Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw). Something isn't right in Christy's voice, too hopeful. Her motherly instinct doesn't fool her because the hope in Christy is quickly destroyed when Eileen reveals that she's going to be married. Daniel Day-Lewis is so powerful that you could literally see his heart being blown into pieces, and the way the situation becomes more and more out of control, reveals a dark, almost creepy, side in his personality, a dependence to alcohol and an almost childish incapability to accept his condition, his heart suffers much more than the body, but who could blame him? The power of "My Left Foot" is to rather take an ordinary look of low-budgeted TV family drama rather than a grandiose Hollywood- type biopic, which fits the tone of the film. But it's definitely the three-dimensional, vibrating and passionate Oscar-winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis that reminds you it's not a TV film. However, the movie is not without a few flaws that don't ruin the overall feeling though. At one scene, the father discovers that his wife was saving money for a wheelchair, we wait for his reaction but then it cuts abruptly to him playing with his kid, tickling him. The mother announces that their daughter is going to marry someone because she's pregnant. Mr. Brown's outburst of rage causes Christy to go into a sort of angry trance, trembling and drooling like a rabid dog, he's eager to kill his father. I thought Christy's reaction was disproportionate regarding an attitude than any father would have, much more in that time. It seemed to me that he was supposed to be a hateful character while he was not. The 'porridge' scene was also confusing because it tried to turn Mr. Brown into a real douche-bag while there were more scenes showing pride than animosity between him and Christy, and nothing to show a sort of complicity between Christy and his sister. Apart from these little details, "My Left Foot" tells a great story, about a great character, it's not perfect, but what the heck: humanity is full of remarkable examples of persons whose talent and hard work allow them to overcame their handicap and to communicate with the rest of the world and if it was not for Jim Sheridan's adaptation of the biographic book "My Left Foot" and for Daniel Day-Lewis' extraordinary performance, many of us wouldn't have heard of Christy Brown.

    I like Daniel Day-Lewis. I get what he was after (not milking our sympathy and giving an accurate portrayal). That said, this movie was boring. Boring. First of all, the storyline is just not that great. I realize it's Christy Brown's life. I don't dispute that he's amazing; nor that his mom was amazing; nor his siblings, who, too, are wonderfully loving. It's just not that great a "plot." Secondly, I can be very emotional, but this movie didn't make me cry, laugh, feel indignant, or teach me any great life lesson. I wasn't inspired, and felt no sense of triumph. Thirdly, watching the movie was like someone saying to me, "Hey, there's this guy I read about with cerebral palsy. All he could control was his left foot, so he wrote and painted with it. His paintings were actually very good, and he typed with his toe." My response? "Wow" (with no exclamation point). Am I interested to hear more? No. Am I glad he told me? Not really. Lastly, Daniel Day-Lewis's acting was so good, that I could understand only 15% of his words. Tough to watch a movie when you can't understand the main character. Give me a break.

He captures the discomfort, frustration and loneliness of a man with cerebral palsy, and the passion of a man labelled as 'gifted' but is far more 'gifted' than people really know. From top to bottom, 'My Left Foot' is a huge recommendation for any movie fan, and a definite must-see for any aspiring actor.

    My Left Foot was released in 1989, and likely contained the best acting of that year. I was extremely excited to watch this movie after just seeing Lincoln and realizing what an amazing actor Daniel Day-Lewis is. Besides this and Lincoln, he has also won an Oscar for There Will Be Blood, which I intend to see as soon as possible. It is an older movie, so the quality and style of filmmaking has since changed, but it was still a very good watch. This is an actor's movie. More specifically, this is Daniel Day-Lewis' movie. His work in this is absolutely remarkable, with the way that he completely immersed himself in the role. He plays Christy Brown, a man born with Cerebral Palsy, who is only able to move his neck and his left foot (more like his left leg actually.) This alone is an incredible task on Daniel Day-Lewis' part, having to confine his acting to almost complete paralysis, while gaining remarkable control of his foot, but he also had the inability to talk. Halfway through the film, a character comes in and teaches him to speak, but even after that his voice is very unclear. This was an almost impossible role for anyone to take on, but he was committed enough the he was able to very successfully play it. Through his incredible method of becoming his character rather than portraying it, he was able to take this character where nobody else could. In fact, during the filming of this movie, he hired someone to wheel him around in a wheelchair so that he could remain in character during and away from filming. Supporting actors are rather difficult to concentrate on in a movie like this, but Brenda Fricker, who played Christy Brown's loving and loyal mother, gave a very good performance, winning herself an Oscar. However, Daniel Day-Lewis was the focus of this movie, and he has proved himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and definitely my favorite. Jim Sheridan, who has been nominated for six Oscars (two for my Left Foot,) wrote and directed this picture. Frankly, I was rather disappointed with the movie as a whole. The story was a little random with which parts of his life that they decided to show. There were many times when I was ready to move on to later in his life, or content and wanting more of the time I was in. I also would have preferred for it to have been a little longer, it was only one hundred minutes, which is rather short for a live-action film, and especially a biography. Mainly, I just felt that I hadn't seen enough of Christy Brown when the movie finished, when honestly I could have watched Daniel Day-Lewis' performance for many hours before getting tired or bored. I wasn't at all impressed with the directing in this movie, but Daniel Day-Lewis' transformation into Christy Brown was in the end what made this movie an incredible watch. I was torn with this film, I was very disappointed by the directing and writing, but was completely blown away by the acting. Thankfully, I prefer to weigh goods over bads, so after all I loved this movie. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supportig Actress, along with three unsuccessful nominations for Adapted Screenplay, Directing, and Best Picture. I give this movie a disappointed but pleased 8/10.

    This is based on the autobiography of Christy Brown, a man born with a cerebral palsy, and had to learn how to do things through the only limb that he had control over, and that limb was the title object, his left foot. This film is truly an outstanding movie, it's a masterpiece, one of the best movies of 1989, and even one of the best movies of all time. When I started to watch this film, I didn't expect to see what I saw, I was expecting to see a movie with good acting and good storytelling and writing. THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENY MY FRIENDS! This movie is one of the most wonderful movies ever to play on my television set, it's a wonderful and touching true story of a man who was able to become a success with his only controllable limb. This is a great feel good movie, and it is one of the best movies to portray somebody with a cerebral palsy. One problem I have with this film is that I wish that the real Christy Brown would have lived to see this movie, because he would have been absolutely astounded at how accurately Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed him. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest actors of our time, and here, he is sublime (well, he usually is sublime in just about every movie that he's in). Like his role in In The Name Of The Father, his performance in this film is like no Daniel Day-Lewis performance I've ever seen. When I saw this film, I could have sworn that Daniel Day-Lewis WAS Christy Brown, and I could have sworn that he had a cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis couldn't have possibly done a better job than he did already, he was outstanding beyond words, and he deserved the Academy Award For Best Actor, his first of three wins (he would win two more for There Will Be Blood in 2007, and most recently, Lincoln in 2012). Brenda Fricker also won an Oscar, she would the award for Best Supporting Actress, which was also a well deserved win. As great a job as the rest of the cast did, none of them were as outstanding as Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives one of the best film performances of any movie that I have ever seen, a distinction that I rarely award to actors in movies. So all in all, this is truly an outstanding movie, and it features one of the greatest actors of our time, giving a role that is one of the best performances of any movie. Daniel Day-Lewis has made many great movies, such as There Will Be Blood, Gangs Of New York, and In The Name Of The Father, but My Left Foot is his best performance, he was beyond outstanding, when it came to acting, he was in a class by himself, a level of greatness higher than the highest! Okay, that sounds a little odd, but you'll probably get the point. What makes Daniel Day-Lewis outstanding is probably the fact that he is very selective with what he chooses, I mean that since 1997, he's been in only five movies. But hey, that's a good thing, because there's a good chance that the movie is going to be excellent. But getting back to this film, you've definitely got to see it, you will not believe your eyes when you watch this. When this movie has ended, you will say that you have just viewed one of the greatest movies ever made, as that is exactly what this movie is. 10/10

    As weird as it may sound, "My Left Foot" is a film that's both satisfactory and unsatisfactory at the same time

    The best way to describe a film like Jim Sheridan's 1989 drama My Left Foot is that it is a film that satisfies and dissatisfies both at the same time. On one hand, it does what it's supposed to do which is look into the life of the story's main character. On the other hand, I felt that something about this story was missing and I ended up really wanting much more than what I got. Let's focus on what's good about this film first and foremost: Daniel Day-Lewis himself. No one else but Daniel Day-Lewis could have successfully pulled off the role of a disabled Irishman who can only move with his left foot and yet become an inspiring artist. The way that he disappears into his character and convinces us that he has these physical and mental struggles is nothing short of expertly done. Daniel Day-Lewis isn't the only cast member of this picture that delivers impressive acting, Brenda Fricker is also exceptional as his mother who tries her best to figure out how to take care of her son. Fiona Shaw is also pretty decent as a doctor who forms a special bond with the main character. These three performances are basically the best aspect of this film. Despite that praise, I feel that the storytelling and screenplay for this film is very much a double edged sword. Like I stated earlier, while the storytelling is very efficient and keeps moving along, I could make the argument that it moves a little too fast. What I mean by that statement is that I felt there were parts of the story that felt incomplete in my mind. For example, the main character has a relationship with this one woman in the chronological end of this story given that the story's told through flashbacks. We only see this certain character for about 10 minutes at most and we are given no reason why she's necessary to the plot. In addition to this, while I felt that we got to knew the Day- Lewis character okay enough, I knew little to nothing about everyone else to the point where I forgot about them. I really had no idea what I thought about this picture immediately after watching it and I still have no idea if I still like or dislike the film even while writing the very review you are reading. While I can't say there's anything really terrible about it and recognize the acting skill behind it, I could also say that there aspects of this film that are completely forgettable. It really is a close call, but in the end, I'm afraid that due to its lack of making an impact on me, I can't recommend My Left Foot.

    My Left Foot is the Irish director Jim Sheridan's first film. It is based on the real life story of Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. His left foot was his only controllable limb, and it was this very left foot that changed his life forever, turning him into a master painter and story teller, thanks to his intelligence and perseverance, and, last but not least, his mother. The film is very touching but it does not fall into the trap of the exaggerated sentimentality that we might see in similar subjects. The film is also realistic; Christy's move from an incomprehensible spastic quadriplegic in a poor family to the respectable painter and writer was not an even path. His constant isolation is felt in his constant drinking, his several failed romances and his strained relations with many of those around him, particularly his father. It is mainly the love for his mother which keeps him going. But in his high moments, he cannot escape the isolation he feels as a result of his physical difference with others. There are a few people who really understand him and those few people become the reason for his happiness in the end. The film has the hopeful message that nothing is impossible if you really believe in yourself and those who care for you. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another dazzling performance as Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. Both won Oscars for their roles.

    Christy Brown (1932-1981) was a famous Irish painter and writer born in a family of 22 children. The fact that he was one of the 13 survivors is pretty ironic considering the severe condition he was born with: cerebral palsy. Christy couldn't control his body as if he was in a perpetual battle between his muscles and his will, but destiny, in all mercifulness, left him one avenue to communicate: his left foot. Would you think it was thin consolation? For Christy, it was enough: he could grab objects, hit the doors and eventually write and paint, express his thoughts, and his torments, for cerebral palsy never affected his capacity to learn, to understand, even to surpass the others' intelligence and sensitivity. "My Left Foot" is the inspirational story of Christy Brown. Christy's struggle starts within his own family where everyone is convinced that he would never be able to get an education, although he's loved and treated like a Brown, he's the cripple of the Family, not to say the retarded. One of the hardest to watch scenes of the film occurs when the father (Ray McAnnaly in his last performance) helps his boy to do his homework and has to find out what a quarter of 25% is. For him, it doesn't make sense since 25% is already a quarter but poor Christy Brown gets the answer and desperately tries to write 1/16 with a piece of chalk between his toes, nobody understands. The scene was frustrating and heartbreaking enough to create a totally opposite feeling when Christy writes M-O-T-H- E-R on the floor, the kids cheer, the father is proud and goes buy a drink, Mrs. Brown is overwhelmed, but not that surprised. Hugh O'Connor delivers a magnificent performance, which I'm sure if it was longer, would have earned him more awards. But behind the obligatory cheers, there are more insightful and more thought-provoking lessons to be learned. Mr. Brown refused to put him in an institution, because it would be a disgrace. At that time, they probably didn't expect him to survive or maybe it would cost money but it's on the basis of this decision that the parents allowed Christy to grow up in a normal background, and not have his inspiration being suffocated by medical assistance. Had Christy been born in a rich family, he wouldn't have become this talented artist, and it's even clearer considering the life he had. Brown was treated equally to his brothers, he was toughened by the street, he played soccer, he drank at pubs, he hit and got hit, he was an Irishman in flesh and blood, and it shows all through the film. The genius of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is to never let the feeling of a one-note personality but on the contrary, convey through his body language, his facial expressions and his burning eyes, a tormenting passion and a ferocious desire to live like everybody and to be loved, he can love but it's all about being loved. The 'love' side is plainly occupied by the other powerful performance of the film, Brenda Fricker (who won the Oscar). She's not just the typical Irish mother, who was pregnant during 16 years (I admit, I counted), she incarnates the capability of a mother to understand her boy. Respect and love are important, but understanding someone is sometimes more valuable. She knows what he feels and even foresees the deceptions. In one movingly intelligent scene, she disapproves Christy's growing affection toward the beautiful doctor Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw). Something isn't right in Christy's voice, too hopeful. Her motherly instinct doesn't fool her because the hope in Christy is quickly destroyed when Eileen reveals that she's going to be married. Daniel Day-Lewis is so powerful that you could literally see his heart being blown into pieces, and the way the situation becomes more and more out of control, reveals a dark, almost creepy, side in his personality, a dependence to alcohol and an almost childish incapability to accept his condition, his heart suffers much more than the body, but who could blame him? The power of "My Left Foot" is to rather take an ordinary look of low-budgeted TV family drama rather than a grandiose Hollywood- type biopic, which fits the tone of the film. But it's definitely the three-dimensional, vibrating and passionate Oscar-winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis that reminds you it's not a TV film. However, the movie is not without a few flaws that don't ruin the overall feeling though. At one scene, the father discovers that his wife was saving money for a wheelchair, we wait for his reaction but then it cuts abruptly to him playing with his kid, tickling him. The mother announces that their daughter is going to marry someone because she's pregnant. Mr. Brown's outburst of rage causes Christy to go into a sort of angry trance, trembling and drooling like a rabid dog, he's eager to kill his father. I thought Christy's reaction was disproportionate regarding an attitude than any father would have, much more in that time. It seemed to me that he was supposed to be a hateful character while he was not. The 'porridge' scene was also confusing because it tried to turn Mr. Brown into a real douche-bag while there were more scenes showing pride than animosity between him and Christy, and nothing to show a sort of complicity between Christy and his sister. Apart from these little details, "My Left Foot" tells a great story, about a great character, it's not perfect, but what the heck: humanity is full of remarkable examples of persons whose talent and hard work allow them to overcame their handicap and to communicate with the rest of the world and if it was not for Jim Sheridan's adaptation of the biographic book "My Left Foot" and for Daniel Day-Lewis' extraordinary performance, many of us wouldn't have heard of Christy Brown.
