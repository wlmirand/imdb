    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    I had to join just to say it and mean it. I am touched by this film, whoever discussing to reduce it to simplicity is offensively strayed. The best part is played by Peter Coyote, his bitter and splendid role interpreted and narrated to perfection, along with Emmanuelle's exotic looks, he is the one who starts everything. An American man and a French girl, apparently ordinary. To watch it rightfully, one has to empathize the boundaries created between Mimi and Oscar and how after cooling off the first exciting stage of their relationship, they proceed on neglecting the daily life not minding what really is at their depths. Leaded by tenacious distresses, both, Oscar and Mimi torture themselves to infinity, while at the same time, they're building up something profound inside that even they do not realize. Concerning the main spectators, the British matrimony in the cruise, a poor minded couple of insipid looks personifying the conventional lifestyle of the majority, they expose the radical contrast against the intensiveness of the other affair, which in turn serves as psychological therapy for them. It's a grown film about human behaviors towards the most powerful global force: search for love or personal satisfaction. The final blow that makes this film a masterpiece, is the (very important to mention)soundtrack extraordinarily attached to the picture by Vangelis. Without it, the transmission of sensations through the scenes would not have been so strong and powerful, which is substantially the highlight of the film. So... If only for its music, I recommend not to miss this rare and deep story that might make you meditate while or after wards, if you're that perceptive.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    I had to join just to say it and mean it. I am touched by this film, whoever discussing to reduce it to simplicity is offensively strayed. The best part is played by Peter Coyote, his bitter and splendid role interpreted and narrated to perfection, along with Emmanuelle's exotic looks, he is the one who starts everything. An American man and a French girl, apparently ordinary. To watch it rightfully, one has to empathize the boundaries created between Mimi and Oscar and how after cooling off the first exciting stage of their relationship, they proceed on neglecting the daily life not minding what really is at their depths. Leaded by tenacious distresses, both, Oscar and Mimi torture themselves to infinity, while at the same time, they're building up something profound inside that even they do not realize. Concerning the main spectators, the British matrimony in the cruise, a poor minded couple of insipid looks personifying the conventional lifestyle of the majority, they expose the radical contrast against the intensiveness of the other affair, which in turn serves as psychological therapy for them. It's a grown film about human behaviors towards the most powerful global force: search for love or personal satisfaction. The final blow that makes this film a masterpiece, is the (very important to mention)soundtrack extraordinarily attached to the picture by Vangelis. Without it, the transmission of sensations through the scenes would not have been so strong and powerful, which is substantially the highlight of the film. So... If only for its music, I recommend not to miss this rare and deep story that might make you meditate while or after wards, if you're that perceptive.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    I had to join just to say it and mean it. I am touched by this film, whoever discussing to reduce it to simplicity is offensively strayed. The best part is played by Peter Coyote, his bitter and splendid role interpreted and narrated to perfection, along with Emmanuelle's exotic looks, he is the one who starts everything. An American man and a French girl, apparently ordinary. To watch it rightfully, one has to empathize the boundaries created between Mimi and Oscar and how after cooling off the first exciting stage of their relationship, they proceed on neglecting the daily life not minding what really is at their depths. Leaded by tenacious distresses, both, Oscar and Mimi torture themselves to infinity, while at the same time, they're building up something profound inside that even they do not realize. Concerning the main spectators, the British matrimony in the cruise, a poor minded couple of insipid looks personifying the conventional lifestyle of the majority, they expose the radical contrast against the intensiveness of the other affair, which in turn serves as psychological therapy for them. It's a grown film about human behaviors towards the most powerful global force: search for love or personal satisfaction. The final blow that makes this film a masterpiece, is the (very important to mention)soundtrack extraordinarily attached to the picture by Vangelis. Without it, the transmission of sensations through the scenes would not have been so strong and powerful, which is substantially the highlight of the film. So... If only for its music, I recommend not to miss this rare and deep story that might make you meditate while or after wards, if you're that perceptive.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    I had to join just to say it and mean it. I am touched by this film, whoever discussing to reduce it to simplicity is offensively strayed. The best part is played by Peter Coyote, his bitter and splendid role interpreted and narrated to perfection, along with Emmanuelle's exotic looks, he is the one who starts everything. An American man and a French girl, apparently ordinary. To watch it rightfully, one has to empathize the boundaries created between Mimi and Oscar and how after cooling off the first exciting stage of their relationship, they proceed on neglecting the daily life not minding what really is at their depths. Leaded by tenacious distresses, both, Oscar and Mimi torture themselves to infinity, while at the same time, they're building up something profound inside that even they do not realize. Concerning the main spectators, the British matrimony in the cruise, a poor minded couple of insipid looks personifying the conventional lifestyle of the majority, they expose the radical contrast against the intensiveness of the other affair, which in turn serves as psychological therapy for them. It's a grown film about human behaviors towards the most powerful global force: search for love or personal satisfaction. The final blow that makes this film a masterpiece, is the (very important to mention)soundtrack extraordinarily attached to the picture by Vangelis. Without it, the transmission of sensations through the scenes would not have been so strong and powerful, which is substantially the highlight of the film. So... If only for its music, I recommend not to miss this rare and deep story that might make you meditate while or after wards, if you're that perceptive.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    I had to join just to say it and mean it. I am touched by this film, whoever discussing to reduce it to simplicity is offensively strayed. The best part is played by Peter Coyote, his bitter and splendid role interpreted and narrated to perfection, along with Emmanuelle's exotic looks, he is the one who starts everything. An American man and a French girl, apparently ordinary. To watch it rightfully, one has to empathize the boundaries created between Mimi and Oscar and how after cooling off the first exciting stage of their relationship, they proceed on neglecting the daily life not minding what really is at their depths. Leaded by tenacious distresses, both, Oscar and Mimi torture themselves to infinity, while at the same time, they're building up something profound inside that even they do not realize. Concerning the main spectators, the British matrimony in the cruise, a poor minded couple of insipid looks personifying the conventional lifestyle of the majority, they expose the radical contrast against the intensiveness of the other affair, which in turn serves as psychological therapy for them. It's a grown film about human behaviors towards the most powerful global force: search for love or personal satisfaction. The final blow that makes this film a masterpiece, is the (very important to mention)soundtrack extraordinarily attached to the picture by Vangelis. Without it, the transmission of sensations through the scenes would not have been so strong and powerful, which is substantially the highlight of the film. So... If only for its music, I recommend not to miss this rare and deep story that might make you meditate while or after wards, if you're that perceptive.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    I had to join just to say it and mean it. I am touched by this film, whoever discussing to reduce it to simplicity is offensively strayed. The best part is played by Peter Coyote, his bitter and splendid role interpreted and narrated to perfection, along with Emmanuelle's exotic looks, he is the one who starts everything. An American man and a French girl, apparently ordinary. To watch it rightfully, one has to empathize the boundaries created between Mimi and Oscar and how after cooling off the first exciting stage of their relationship, they proceed on neglecting the daily life not minding what really is at their depths. Leaded by tenacious distresses, both, Oscar and Mimi torture themselves to infinity, while at the same time, they're building up something profound inside that even they do not realize. Concerning the main spectators, the British matrimony in the cruise, a poor minded couple of insipid looks personifying the conventional lifestyle of the majority, they expose the radical contrast against the intensiveness of the other affair, which in turn serves as psychological therapy for them. It's a grown film about human behaviors towards the most powerful global force: search for love or personal satisfaction. The final blow that makes this film a masterpiece, is the (very important to mention)soundtrack extraordinarily attached to the picture by Vangelis. Without it, the transmission of sensations through the scenes would not have been so strong and powerful, which is substantially the highlight of the film. So... If only for its music, I recommend not to miss this rare and deep story that might make you meditate while or after wards, if you're that perceptive.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    I had to join just to say it and mean it. I am touched by this film, whoever discussing to reduce it to simplicity is offensively strayed. The best part is played by Peter Coyote, his bitter and splendid role interpreted and narrated to perfection, along with Emmanuelle's exotic looks, he is the one who starts everything. An American man and a French girl, apparently ordinary. To watch it rightfully, one has to empathize the boundaries created between Mimi and Oscar and how after cooling off the first exciting stage of their relationship, they proceed on neglecting the daily life not minding what really is at their depths. Leaded by tenacious distresses, both, Oscar and Mimi torture themselves to infinity, while at the same time, they're building up something profound inside that even they do not realize. Concerning the main spectators, the British matrimony in the cruise, a poor minded couple of insipid looks personifying the conventional lifestyle of the majority, they expose the radical contrast against the intensiveness of the other affair, which in turn serves as psychological therapy for them. It's a grown film about human behaviors towards the most powerful global force: search for love or personal satisfaction. The final blow that makes this film a masterpiece, is the (very important to mention)soundtrack extraordinarily attached to the picture by Vangelis. Without it, the transmission of sensations through the scenes would not have been so strong and powerful, which is substantially the highlight of the film. So... If only for its music, I recommend not to miss this rare and deep story that might make you meditate while or after wards, if you're that perceptive.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    I had to join just to say it and mean it. I am touched by this film, whoever discussing to reduce it to simplicity is offensively strayed. The best part is played by Peter Coyote, his bitter and splendid role interpreted and narrated to perfection, along with Emmanuelle's exotic looks, he is the one who starts everything. An American man and a French girl, apparently ordinary. To watch it rightfully, one has to empathize the boundaries created between Mimi and Oscar and how after cooling off the first exciting stage of their relationship, they proceed on neglecting the daily life not minding what really is at their depths. Leaded by tenacious distresses, both, Oscar and Mimi torture themselves to infinity, while at the same time, they're building up something profound inside that even they do not realize. Concerning the main spectators, the British matrimony in the cruise, a poor minded couple of insipid looks personifying the conventional lifestyle of the majority, they expose the radical contrast against the intensiveness of the other affair, which in turn serves as psychological therapy for them. It's a grown film about human behaviors towards the most powerful global force: search for love or personal satisfaction. The final blow that makes this film a masterpiece, is the (very important to mention)soundtrack extraordinarily attached to the picture by Vangelis. Without it, the transmission of sensations through the scenes would not have been so strong and powerful, which is substantially the highlight of the film. So... If only for its music, I recommend not to miss this rare and deep story that might make you meditate while or after wards, if you're that perceptive.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

    First off, this film is one of the more unique I have ever watched. It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He "thinks" he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is na&iuml;ve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations. Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts. When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant  disregarding the nurturing aspect of D/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is "poisoned" (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once na&iuml;ve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him  in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship  that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all  even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements  definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story  not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

    Much has been well described ad nauseum about the plot, music, background, character flaws, etc. of Bitter Moon. Besides all of these truths, there is something else that exists, namely the powerful feminine impact that Mimi portrayed to the extent that it seemed far too real to be left encased in the fantasy realm of movie art. Her character part as well as her actual beauty, dancing talent, and sexuality is the exponent of femininity, grace, and desirability. Men remain tortured by their obsession with everything that Mimi portrayed in the film. Not unlike Jean Seberg in Lilith, whose character mesmerized, beguiled, and commandeered most of those who ran across her path, Mimi had that quality which likewise reaches out beyond the movie itself to ensnare the hearts of all men. Not everyone gets it, but it is plain to see from galleries of fan mail to Emmanuelle Seigner, this one movie part seems to have entrenched her immortality into many men's souls. This gut-wrenching obsession with the magical combination of a certain actress coupled to a script and director brings forth restless insomnia for appreciative men as Seigner has done here. If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Or try Kim Novack in Bell Book and Candle. These are a few of the magical concoctions of film art where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality." Even Shakespeare, much less Oscar, cannot compensate with words for those who appear limited in physical beauty and sensuousness, while Seigner's beauty portrays endless potential for being tapped, you might say. And Polanski's product leads to a powerful representation of man's instinct and obsession for beauty, sensuousness, and the ideal everyman's woman. We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship. Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.

    For all those who think that this dark psychological drama from Roman Polanski is just kinky sex and full of S&M, it isn't - and simply isn't a film for you, or at least for what you want. There are a few reviews around where such people wanted those elements and when they didn't like the baggage and the 130 minutes running time, they gave it one star. This is an intelligent, 'thinking person' relationship drama that follows themes often visited by Polanski, not least his debut, the Polish language Knife In the Water. One couldn't help thinking there's a bit of Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Open in there too. However, despite all that is written, apart from the first few minutes, settling us into the characters and scenario, for the first hour or so, is actually a very lovely and often seductive and tender adult love story, set against the romance and beauty of Paris. With Peter Coyote's American writer, following and referring to other 'Americans in Paris' F Scott Fitzgerald and such, becoming the film's narrator and lead character, it really is the rose-tinted view of Parisian life and women that's fuelled popular culture and literature for decades. In this case, it's Polanski's actual wife (Emmanuelle Seigner) who plays the young and nubile dancer, Mimi, that takes on the older Oscar (Coyote). The seduction and (non-graphic) sex scenes are actually very sensual and erotic, enticing us into a world of bliss, allowing Polanski to share with us his own fantasies (perhaps) as well as putting this relationship on a high plateau, from which it ultimately disintegrates - this being the thrust of the movie. To give credence and body to all this, a now wheelchair-bound Oscar confides in reserved posh Brit Hugh Grant, in a sort of bitter wife-swap scenario, that's both warped and distasteful. They're all on a cruise to India, via Turkey and the in built confinement and boredom this provides is the prefect trap. Nigel Dobson (Grant) though, cannot keep away from these reminisces and his relationship with his own wife Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is put under the microscope and the four slip into an unhealthy psychological m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Throughout, Polanski is playful, devious, malicious and often in love with the idea of his wife playing the young temptress in all this. In my view - and circumstances - would say that this really needs the life experiences of those over forty in its audience for them to halfway appreciate human nature and all its dark sides, as well as its joys. Some say it is excellent, I think it far from being his best work but a whole lot better than many he's made. I bought my DVD from Cash Converters for 66.6p, recurring.

    Roman Polanksi's Bitter Moon is fascinating to watch but difficult to digest, leading one to wonder what exactly the great director is getting at with this twisted, tragic love story. It seems to me that, in the end, what Polanski wants to explore the most is love, which is expressed here mostly through physical means. The four main characters are mirror images of one another. The Brits are sophisticated, straightforward and seemingly comfortable just where they are in life and love. The American and French woman are by contrast unhinged, crazed, filled with the desire to do anything in order to achieve pure, unadulterated happiness and fulfillment. What Polanski does with these characters is astounding. Using two as the launching pad for what will happen to the others, he weaves a tale of love gone terribly sour, originating in purity and innocence but soon twisted into games of revenge, power struggles and the need for absolute freedom. The end result, it would seem, is Polanski attempting to show how weird and manipulated love can become, leading essentially to a perversion of the basic institutions of human society, namely marriage and family. Cinematically, this is one of Polanski's very best films with subtle, powerful direction, astonishingly believable performances by all four actors and a story that is less about sex than it is about what love can be and often becomes.

    I had to join just to say it and mean it. I am touched by this film, whoever discussing to reduce it to simplicity is offensively strayed. The best part is played by Peter Coyote, his bitter and splendid role interpreted and narrated to perfection, along with Emmanuelle's exotic looks, he is the one who starts everything. An American man and a French girl, apparently ordinary. To watch it rightfully, one has to empathize the boundaries created between Mimi and Oscar and how after cooling off the first exciting stage of their relationship, they proceed on neglecting the daily life not minding what really is at their depths. Leaded by tenacious distresses, both, Oscar and Mimi torture themselves to infinity, while at the same time, they're building up something profound inside that even they do not realize. Concerning the main spectators, the British matrimony in the cruise, a poor minded couple of insipid looks personifying the conventional lifestyle of the majority, they expose the radical contrast against the intensiveness of the other affair, which in turn serves as psychological therapy for them. It's a grown film about human behaviors towards the most powerful global force: search for love or personal satisfaction. The final blow that makes this film a masterpiece, is the (very important to mention)soundtrack extraordinarily attached to the picture by Vangelis. Without it, the transmission of sensations through the scenes would not have been so strong and powerful, which is substantially the highlight of the film. So... If only for its music, I recommend not to miss this rare and deep story that might make you meditate while or after wards, if you're that perceptive.

    The story unfolds in a rather pessimistic and suicidal manner (similar to the other Polansky flicks). By the end of it the four leading characters are tied up in a highly erratic, erotic, and deadly knot. Personally I had underestimated this film considering it to be some shallow soft porn, but now after watching it, I consider it to be an amazing psychological drama that digs deep into man and woman. The story, however tragic and frantic, looks and feels very realistic. It is shown in vivid colours how a man can frustrate his life and how a woman can fade away under the influence of her partner's cruelty. That's for the story. Just an external layer, to be more exact. As to the technical side of the production, I would say that the colour scheme of the movie, the shots of the ocean and the wandering ship, the representation of the New Year party (when the booze opens gates to all manner of deviations  with even a couple of karate/kung-fu moves, which you never expected to come), the choice of actors, and their play are all quite impressive. No major changes in any aspect of this film are needed (though it would have been a bit better without certain hot material in the middle of the film, while as you can clearly perceive, the UNSEEN sexual intercourse with the black male dancer IS the breaking point in the story, though not the only one, proving again that often it's what you don't see on screen disturbs the most). The Mimi character is as overwhelming, as only a woman can be. Once I watched "Basic Instinct" (many years ago) and kind of liked it. Then there was "Lolita". Also found it not bad. "Eyes Wide Shut" was next - found it interesting too. "Dogville" was next and really enjoyed its exploitation hysteria. But "Bitter Moon", touching upon similar topics, simply kicks those four off to non-existence being superior on all levels: the story, the drama, the punch line, the actors' play, the camera-work and the decorations (maybe on a par with "Eyes Wide Shut" in this department), the music (the choice of melodies for the different sets just hits the mark - it is as good as the choice of the music for Rockstar's "Vice City", if you know what I mean), etc. Actually remember watching quite a number of adult thrillers and to me this one is the winner in the category. Being adult with XXX material (meaning scenes of sex), it is not an erotic showcase. It is a showcase of the popular modern way of leading a joyful life of pleasures. It is a showcase of ignorant souls (ignorance is bliss) and malfunctioning bodies, A showcase of a dead end. "To die young is glorious", "Sleep with and impregnate as many girls as possible", "Don't think about tomorrow - it's weakness", "We live only once and should taste it all". Are these mottoes correct? The movie makes harsh statements without being didactic. If this film is a kind of warning for you  that's pretty helpful, if it's more of a mirror  that's pretty exasperating. But in both cases it's a knife thrown in your lake. There will be crease marks. It's also one of those rare films when, after watching, I am interested in the career of the leading actors. Their performance here is not just fine, it's freaking on the verge. Have not expected to give this movie a high mark, but cannot help it. It evokes deep emotions and from now on it is definitely my favourite adult thriller. A 9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

    During a trip to India in a cruiser, a boring British couple -Nigel and Fiona- become friendly with a crippled writer (Oskar) and his sexy wife Mimi. This film is a twisted tale of obsessive love; how passion and sex can eventually destroy the lives of two people. It seems it would turn out to be a movie with a somber, downbeat tone, but not under Polanski's direction; he manages to inject lots of sarcasm and black humour into the film, especially in the character of Oskar (a magnificent performance by Peter Coyote). Nigel is in love with Mimi, so Oskar and her take advantage of this to make fun and manipulate him; the writer tells him the story of their bizarre love story, while Mimi deceives Nigel every time he tries to approach her. Fiona remains a passive character in this "love triangle"...until she drastically changes the course of events in the last scenes of the film. This tragicomedy is one of Polanski's masterpieces, along with "The Pianist" and "Rosemary's Baby"; although it seems it was misunderstood and not well received back in 1992. It also has a great soundtrack with tunes by The Communards, Lionel Richie and Bryan Ferry, which fit perfectly with the tone of the film.

    British couple Fiona and Nigel Dobson are sailing to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful French woman... I find this film very difficult to judge or even to categorize. It is clearly a Roman Polanski film, as evidenced by the casting of Emmanuelle Seigner and the depraved sexual situations (a golden shower, lesbianism, and some strange pig mask). Having known Peter Coyote primarily from "A Walk to Remember", it was quite a shock to hear him talk so dirty, drink milk from a woman's breast and engage in oral sex. Well played, Pete. Hugh Grant is the main character, despite the fact he has far less screen time than Coyote or Seigner. He appears in the wraparound section, with most of the film being a flashback. But the basic plot revolves around the idea of fidelity -- will Nigel (Grant) cheat on his wife with this foreign beauty? He has her husband's permission, but does he have the disloyal drive to follow through? (This gets more complex as the film progresses, but you really need not know more just yet.) While I have found Seigner attractive before, this film does not present her well in my opinion. Exotic, yes. Sexy, no. But the men in the film would disagree. There could be some discussion about what "bitter moon" means. The phrase is never uttered in the film or clearly explained. There is a scene that features a moon that might be called bitter (it tastes of "poison" to one person and "sweet" to another). Does this suggest that a bitter moon would be a situation where two people share very different outlooks or viewpoints? Perhaps. Or it could simply be the reverse of a honeymoon. If we were to list Polanski's films from best to worst, this would appear somewhere in the middle. Perhaps the lower middle. By no means does it achieve the level of his masterpieces, but it does not come up short like "Cul-de-Sac" (though that film has its merits, too). The film is great as a character study or as a discussion of love and relationships, but it drags enough at times that it cannot be called flawless. Grant fans will be disappointed, but Polanski fans ought to give it a fair shot.

    There is an easy way to tell if a movie that is breaking sexual taboos is working or not. Sex scenes that don't work make people laugh. Sex scenes that do work make people squirm. 'Bitter Moon' fits uncomfortably into the latter. While it looks like lurid trash melodrama. Roman Polanski juggles a tricky balance of bad taste, sexual intrigue and a good story. Somehow he pulls it off. 'Bitter Moon' begins on a cruise ship with Nigel, a proper Englishman (Hugh Grant) who meets a gorgeous woman named Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner) in a bar and is intoxicated by her. A short time later he meets her alcoholic husband Oscar (Peter Coyote) who is confined to a wheelchair. There Oscar begins to tell him the long story of how the two of them met. Spinning a tale from which Nigel is only held by the presence of Mimi, their story begins with a simple love story, how they met, and fell in lust with one another. Then, as all stories built on sex end up, they got bored, locked themselves away and began a bizarre, kinky S&M roleplay. The game got more and more serious until Oscar ended up in that wheelchair. Bitter Moon is overly sexual, trashy, kinky, freaky and uncomfortable. In anyone else hands that might be a bad thing but in the hands of Roman Polansky we expect a degree of quality control. He is, and always has been, the master of his instrument and his achievement here is the ability to create this kind of bizarro sex tragedy and never make it laughable. That works mainly because of the casting. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the kind of meek, mild fellow who probably thinks about sex but never acts on impulse. He's married to Fiona (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who offers little sexual energy and allows us to understand why Nigel is so intrigued by the couple. PeterCoyote has always been a mature, fearless actor with a slightly scary voice whose words in this films slither through his teeth with a kind of slippery anger. He informs Nigel that: "Everyone has a sadistic streak, and nothing brings it out better than the knowledge you've got someone at your mercy." The best performance in the film, however, belongs to (Emmauel Seigner) as Mimi. She gives the kind of lurid performance that could illicit bad laughs like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Madonna in the godawful Body of Evidence. She is better than either by making her sexuality come from within and not wearing as a costume role. She's gorgeous and mysterious and plays a rube like Nigel like a pinball machine. 'Bitter Moon' is a trashy film but a good one. Polanski is willing to go over the line with lurid melodrama and he doesn't lose his nerve. He is brave filmmaker. Even braver is Emmanuel Seigneir (Polanski's wife) who is required to do things in this film that many actresses wouldn't touch for fear of their reputation. She does them and never backs off. 'Bitter Moon', like 'Damage' is a movie for adults. Both films speak about sex in a mature fashion without compromise. *** (of four)

    Oscar the wheel bound man on his way to Istambul is traveling with his much younger and gorgeous wife, Mimi. He is not a happy man. When he meets Nigel, he is trying to go back to his cabin, but needs help in doing so. Nigel is a young Englishman on his honeymoon with Fiona, his straitlaced bride. Mimi had caught Nigel's eye. Oscar invites Nigel to a drink in his room, where he begins to tell the story of his life with Mimi. Oscar meets Mimi on board a 96 bus in Paris. An inspector comes to check tickets; it becomes clear the young woman sitting near Oscar has not paid her fare. He hands her his own ticket so she is not caught, and Oscar is given a fine. In doing so, he misses the opportunity to be with this ravishing creature. When he finally catches up with her, she is working as a waitress in a bistro. Oscar does not know, but he is in for the ride of his life. Oscar, an American living in Paris, has written a few books no one has read. As he starts seeing Mimi, he discovers she is a sensual woman who matches his own libido. They begin a torrid affair. Mimi caters to Oscar every sexual desire, inventing erotic fantasies they play on each other. The sex is great, but when Mimi starts getting boring, Oscar decides he has had it. Wanting to get rid of her, Oscar books a flight to Martinique. Once on board, he executes a brilliant plan, one where Mimi had no clue about what is going to happen to her. The time goes by and Mimi shows up one day at Oscar's door. She has regain her confidence; clearly, she has become a sophisticated woman. Oscar, not wanting to rehash their past, rejects the idea of seeing her again. When he suffers an accident that lands him in a hospital with fractures, Mimi pays him a visit. This encounter will render Oscar a paraplegic, and her slave, because of the revenge she has planned for him. Now, years later, Oscar and Mimi are taking a trip in the ocean liner. Mimi clearly likes Nigel. Her interest is in part a way to humiliate the man that is now dependent on her. Oscar knows she is into having other men; their relation has changed forever. Nigel's attention to Mimi provokes Fiona's hate for the sexy woman. Oscar also has plans of his own. Everything comes to a head at the new year's party, when a defiant Fiona takes to the dance floor where Mimi has been dancing in a provocative way by herself. The two women, it becomes apparent want more than just a dance together. Oscar decides to put a stop to it all in a finale that no one could have predicted. Roman Polanski shows an interesting take on the novel by Pascal Bruckner's "Lunes De Fiel", which he helped adapt for the screen with Jeff Gross, Gerard Brach and John Brownjohn. Not having seen it in its commercial release, we caught up with it recently on a cable channel. Mr. Polanski goes for the lurid aspect of the story, one in which is full of kinkiness in the early relationship between Mimi and Oscar. There are graphic details of sado-masochism in the bedroom scenes in Oscar's apartment. After a while, so much sex becomes a bit tedious, but that has its purpose in the way Mr. Polanski wanted to give the finished product. He is a man that is not shy showing passion. Peter Coyote is Oscar. One of the best things he has done in movies. His take on Oscar shows an obsessed man that gets a dose of his own medicine. Casting his own wife, Emanuelle Seigner as Mimi, is a bold move for Mr. Polanski. She was at the height of her youth and beauty, so her Mimi is quite a sight for sore eyes. The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.
