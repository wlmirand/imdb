 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Melanie Parker, an architect and mother of Sammy, and Jack Taylor, a newspaper columnist and father of Maggie, are both divorced. They meet one morning when overwhelmed Jack is left unexpectedly with Maggie and forgets that Melanie was to take her to school. As a result, both children miss their school field trip and are stuck with the parents. The two adults project their negative stereotypes of ex-spouses on each other, but end up needing to rely on each other to watch the children as each must save his job. Humor is added by Sammy's propensity for lodging objects in his nose and Maggie's tendency to wander.

    I was watching this movie mainly because I love Michelle pfieffer, shes my dream woman and one of my favorite actresses. But this movie just showed messed up lives of 2 single ultra busy parents. All they did through the entire film was run around, worried all the time, hectic beyond measure, dealing with a bunch of jerks, dealing with there kids. it just was too much. there was little to no romance except at the very end but the rest of the time pfieffer and Clooney are bitter, bickering, looking the other way all the time, talking on cell phones and it just lacked any real warmth between the 2. this isn't supposed to be frankie and johnny but it seems more like the PG13 version of that movie. perhaps some parts of it were funny, the rest of it was just a reminder of why I am glad I 1. am not a single parent 2. glad I don't live in the city with all these creeps 3. don't have to deal with all these super pressures with kids attached to the hip. everyone has'em, but it just made me kinda sad that both these people are divorced and just kinda draggin these kids around with no other parent to help them out. I mean, I understand the divorce rate is high today, but I would have rather seen a story of a divorced couple getting back together then these super busy workaholic dopes who have to drag there kids along every 2 minutes. they need both a mother and a father, not just one or the other being dragged around like rag dolls everywhere they go. Dad goes to work, mom stays home to raise the kids. this is ideally how it should be. not in this day and age apparently. this movie was in its own way showing the ridiculous stupid reality of today and was quite frankly depressing to witness. you don't get the feeling Clooney and pfieffers characters were going to be together very long after the credits role.

    Let's face it. There are several times during our everyday lives when we just need to...RELAX.In other words, we just need to de-compress,to spend some free time watching a funny,optimistic movie and escape from our anxieties and our problems even for a couple of hours. Well..."One Fine Day" fulfills this target perfectly. It's a really nice film, the story is simple and funny(similar to a screwball comedy),the lines are clever and the two stars ,Pfeiffer and Clooney,are very good at their roles. More precisely,they both play two single parents who are forced,due to the fact that their kids miss the school trip,to cooperate and spend almost an entire day together in order to compromise their demanding schedule at work and the care of their children. Jack(Clooney)is a cool,charming newspaper reporter and Melanie(Pfeiffer) is a clever,dynamic and slightly neurotic architect.Of course the attraction between them is obvious from the very first moment but since they don't admit the truth to each other, they spend the entire day flirting and creating a romantic and funny battle of the sexes. Like I said, it's a really nice film, that can cheer you up. Even though it deserves an 8/10, I give it a 10/10 because I think it's unfortunately underrated. Try it and relax!!!

    I had to watch this dreadful film on a bus ride. It's supposed to be a sweet romantic comedy with George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer but the film just falls short. They're both single parents in New York City and they are having the worst day or the best day. The film's writing is weak and the actors don't do anything for me. The film is really bad in my opinion and I can't stand George Clooney at all as obnoxious jerk of a Daily News reporter, Jack Taylor. Michelle Pfeiffer does better as an architect, single mother. The supporting cast is excellent except they're just acting their parts. The film is a lame attempt to talk about single parenting in the city. The supporting cast has Holland Taylor as Melanie's mother just like her role as Evelyn on television. Ellen Greene is barely recognizable as Elaine Lieberman but does a nice job. Charles Durning is wonderful as always as Jack's boss. Sheila Kelley plays Jack's ex. Pete Hamill, a well known New York City reporter, plays a New York City reporter by a different name. I don't know why they just didn't let him play himself. Pete Hamill is a New York City institution. Anyway, the film was done a few years before events changed New York City forever.

    I had heard of this film once before because of the leading actor and actress starring, and I am not one to turn the occasional possibly naff and cheesy but easy to like love story filled with giggle, from director Michael Hoffman (A Midsummer Night's Dream). Basically, in New York City, Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an architect and single mother to son Sammy (Home Alone 3's Alex D. Linz), Jack Taylor (George Clooney) is a New York Daily News columnist and single father to daughter Maggie (Independence Day's Mae Whitman), both of them are divorced. One fine day the two parents meet each other, morning time, and when both the children are late for the field trips they were meant to go, they are forced to join the parents during their hectic schedules, and make sure that they are cared for with their needs as well. Melanie must show an important client her architectural design presentation, and Sammy is causing havoc when he causes her to break her scale model, and in frustration she takes him to a daycare centre, holding a "Superhero Day". Jack is trying to get a scoop from Mayor Sidney Aikens (Sidney Armus) about his connections with the mob, and he is bringing Maggie to the daycare centre as well, and they have improvised superhero costumes made. Melanie is on her way to a meeting she gets a worrying phone call from her son about something to do with drugs, and in desperation she asks Jack, who she has the number of now, to get the kids, and he agrees as long as she has them at a time. Melanie breaks down while with the kids she loses Maggie, and she is forced to report the child missing, but thankfully she is found, and Jack is informed of this occurrence, but he makes it to the press conference to confront the Mayor and get his scoop. Sammy is looking forward to a soccer game that his father will hopefully be at, his mother insists she will have time to pitch her architecture idea to the clients at a restaurant, but she sacrifices it during, at risk of getting fired, for the sake of her child. The clients were actually impressed with her dedication to her child, and Sammy and Maggie make it to the soccer game, with Sammy's father indeed showing up, but not for long, as he is drumming for Bruce Springsteen. That evening Jack needs an excuse to go and see Melanie at her apartment, so he gets Maggie to buy a new goldfish to replace their other one that was eaten by the cat. While the children watch The Wizard of Oz together, Jack and Melanie seem to get on much better than they were in their hectic day, where they squabbled and were rushed, but they share a kiss, before falling asleep together on the sofa. Also starring The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning as Lew, Jon Robin Baitz as Yates Jr., Ellen Greene as Elaine Lieberman, Joe Grifasi as Manny Feldstein, Pete Hamill as Frank Burroughs and Anna Maria Horsford as Evelyn. Pfeiffer makes a convincing single mother who is forced into having to look after her often bratty child, Clooney is likable as the single father who ha a similar situation with his sweet daughter, Whitman is nice as the little girl, and I agree that Linz is a little less cute with his needy nature. For this theme of film, this actually works not just for the reasonable laughs and alright enough love story, but it is also a convincing portrait of the life of single parents, I will admit it could have had a more layered script, but it is an interesting enough romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "For The First Time" (also nominated the Golden Globe). Worth watching!

    The fine day of the title is ironic. In fact we are seeing a rainy day in chaotic New York, where a man and a woman, both divorced, are trying to fulfil their hectic schedules with their respective children in tow. The man is Jack Taylor, a high-flying reporter (George Clooney), and the woman is Melanie Parker, an equally ambitious architect (Michelle Pfeiffer). Due to a mix-up, the two children (excellently played by Mae Whitman & Alex Linz), miss out on a school trip, and the parents agree to share responsibilities between them. All sorts of mishaps befall them, including Melanie losing Jack's daughter for a while. The stress and strain results in much hostility and fault-finding between the two leads. Which fools nobody. We can see the result coming a mile off. This predictable movie certainly isn't the finest day of either Clooney or Pfeiffer. Both have made celluloads of better films. HOWEVER, it's a really enjoyable film to watch if you want the feelgood factor. Perhaps you have had a bad day, and it's raining outside. Watch this movie curled up on the sofa, with a cup of steaming cocoa. it's a nice lovable Hollywood romance. Clooney is Clooney, and Pfeiffer is always luminous even in her less demanding roles. And listen out for a meltingly beautiful performance of "One fine day" by Natalie Merchant (though it was the song "For the first time" that got Oscar-nominated).

    Long gone are the days when I considered myself a romantic but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying this charming romantic comedy to a degree, even though it is a genre of film that I used to like better when I was younger. For a romantic comedy this one is fun and has some charm. It is romantic without being too lame or mushy stuff, although it still is cheesy at times. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer have perfect chemistry. So have the two kids, as good in their respective roles as the adults are on theirs. Despite all the fast pace and daily rush subject this films deals with, it still has room for classic humor, romance and a certain nostalgic/classic feeling to it thanks to oldie songs and the excellent scenario of New York city, making that city look perhaps better than it really is, especially now after the horrifying events of 11th September 2001. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer would make a good couple in real life, just like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner would. Their characters's rivalries are funny although they become frustrating after a while, but not profane or sadistic, they're just normal (if unnecessary) rivalries. This should please most fans of romantic comedies and might as well please (to a degree) some who are not into this type of film.

    Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com ! I watched this movie a long time back, when I was still in school. At that time I used to hate anything romantic, and would avoid it like the plague. So when my elder cousin bro and his wife booked tickets for this movie, I was thoroughly disappointed. To make things even worse, they had booked the late night show, where all the couples usually turn up. Now you know how much I would have wanted to hate this flick :p. However, as luck would have it, I actually ended up liking the movie quite a bit. In fact I remember feeling a bit guilty admitting that I actually enjoyed the movie. Twelve or maybe thirteen years down the line, I caught the movie once again a few days back, and I still enjoy this one as much as before. This is not your standard romantic comedies types. It is quite surreal, relatable and oh so cute! Perfect movie to watch or snuggle to, with that special someone. Either that, or I have managed to read the fairer sex very wrongly . Anyways let me know if you think otherwise :)

    This movie is wonderful. Really makes my heart happy every time I see it. I first saw it when I was 12, now at I'm 25 and I enjoy it even more. The story is amazingly simple and beautiful, a bit predictable indeed, but the feeling in the movie makes your heart sing, like a beautiful spring sunny day! All four actors :) are so sweet and natural, it's almost hard for me to imagine that they act and not.. just live one .. fine day. The children are so sweet .. the parents are lovely. I love this world after seeing this movie! Some of you might think that I overreacted, but it's just wonderful! Movie for open heart people!

    I loved this film! It captures perfectly the daily struggle of single parents coping imperfectly with the demands of raising their children. The background of a rainy springtime New York fit the mood perfectly. Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) opens the film dejectedly sitting at her desk writing checks to pay the many pressing bills. Her ex-husband is far more involved in his own pursuits than concern for his son. I suspect that Melanie is getting little financial support from a musician who works only intermittently. The blues really hit home when you get to the late hours and the distractions of earning a living are on temporary hold. It gets really hard not to dump on the absent spouse to preserve a child's relationship to the missing parent. Jack Taylor (George Clooney) lives in a wreck of an apartment that he has no ambition to repair. He has custody of his daughter every other weekend and he is able to get back at his ex-wife by forcing her to leave her daughter in a environment that totally offends her sense of order without being so ramshackle that she can get the courts to intervene. Lots of childish bickering between the parents accompany every custody weekend. Total realism in that scene where the daughter Maggie (Mae Whitman) is dropped off. Melanie is a woman who has been forced to become much more forceful than her nature would prefer. She has enrolled her son Sammy (Alex D. Linz) in a prestigious private school rather than the far inferior public school. That schooling demands the income of a professional woman. She must function in a competitive professional environment. She cannot afford to allow sentiment to hinder her career if she is to provide for her son. But her career is balanced on a knife edge. When Sammy and Maggie miss their school's field trip, due to Jack's cavalier attitude toward the school schedule, the children wind up complicating their parent's already hectic schedule. Jack Taylor definitely has some childlike qualities that both intrigue and annoy Melanie. These traits are what doomed her marriage and she cannot afford to fall for the same irresponsible type of man. She takes a while to realize that when the chips are down, Jack can bring considerable resources to bear on a problem. Jack adores his daughter but is ill equipped to provide a suitable home environment for a girl. Deep down, he realizes he desperately needs a good wife. This awareness makes Jack resist the allure of his coworker Celia, who would enjoy getting much closer to him. It was touching to watch the two children start to bond during their enforced togetherness at the day care center. Sammy starts to look after the welfare of Maggie when it would be easy to just consider himself. Melanie starts to apply her maternal care to Maggie as well as to her son. Jack starts to take an interest in Sammy, a boy who is desperate to have a father in his life. The bond between the parents grows in large measure from their growing attachment to each other's children. The unruly behavior of the two children was very realistic. Children in broken homes often develop such problems. A divorce impacts every aspect of a child's development. The film compresses the development of the romance into a single day. That is somewhat forced and unrealistic. Otherwise, this film is spot on and a joy to watch.

    'One fine Day' is a breezy romantic comedy with winning performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney. The plot is standard Hollywood fluff as both of them keep running into each other while trying to get their respective kids to a school field trip. Both Clooney and Pfeiffer are charming and share good chemistry with each other. If there's a fault, it's that the two remain apart for most of the running time. It would have been nice to see them sharing more screen time together. Still, the film is pleasant fun and well worth watching, specially as a date movie. Overall 7/10

For a romantic comedy this one is fun and has some charm. It is romantic without being too lame or mushy stuff, although it still is cheesy at times. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer have perfect chemistry. So have the two kids, as good in their respective roles as the adults are on theirs. Despite all the fast pace and daily rush subject this films deals with, it still has room for classic humor, romance and a certain nostalgic/classic feeling to it thanks to oldie songs and the excellent scenario of New York city, making that city look perhaps better than it really is, especially now after the horrifying events of 11th September 2001. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer would make a good couple in real life, just like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner would. Their characters's rivalries are funny although they become frustrating after a while, but not profane or sadistic, they're just normal (if unnecessary) rivalries. This should please most fans of romantic comedies and might as well please (to a degree) some who are not into this type of film.

    Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com ! I watched this movie a long time back, when I was still in school. At that time I used to hate anything romantic, and would avoid it like the plague. So when my elder cousin bro and his wife booked tickets for this movie, I was thoroughly disappointed. To make things even worse, they had booked the late night show, where all the couples usually turn up. Now you know how much I would have wanted to hate this flick :p. However, as luck would have it, I actually ended up liking the movie quite a bit. In fact I remember feeling a bit guilty admitting that I actually enjoyed the movie. Twelve or maybe thirteen years down the line, I caught the movie once again a few days back, and I still enjoy this one as much as before. This is not your standard romantic comedies types. It is quite surreal, relatable and oh so cute! Perfect movie to watch or snuggle to, with that special someone. Either that, or I have managed to read the fairer sex very wrongly . Anyways let me know if you think otherwise :)

    This movie is wonderful. Really makes my heart happy every time I see it. I first saw it when I was 12, now at I'm 25 and I enjoy it even more. The story is amazingly simple and beautiful, a bit predictable indeed, but the feeling in the movie makes your heart sing, like a beautiful spring sunny day! All four actors :) are so sweet and natural, it's almost hard for me to imagine that they act and not.. just live one .. fine day. The children are so sweet .. the parents are lovely. I love this world after seeing this movie! Some of you might think that I overreacted, but it's just wonderful! Movie for open heart people!

    I loved this film! It captures perfectly the daily struggle of single parents coping imperfectly with the demands of raising their children. The background of a rainy springtime New York fit the mood perfectly. Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) opens the film dejectedly sitting at her desk writing checks to pay the many pressing bills. Her ex-husband is far more involved in his own pursuits than concern for his son. I suspect that Melanie is getting little financial support from a musician who works only intermittently. The blues really hit home when you get to the late hours and the distractions of earning a living are on temporary hold. It gets really hard not to dump on the absent spouse to preserve a child's relationship to the missing parent. Jack Taylor (George Clooney) lives in a wreck of an apartment that he has no ambition to repair. He has custody of his daughter every other weekend and he is able to get back at his ex-wife by forcing her to leave her daughter in a environment that totally offends her sense of order without being so ramshackle that she can get the courts to intervene. Lots of childish bickering between the parents accompany every custody weekend. Total realism in that scene where the daughter Maggie (Mae Whitman) is dropped off. Melanie is a woman who has been forced to become much more forceful than her nature would prefer. She has enrolled her son Sammy (Alex D. Linz) in a prestigious private school rather than the far inferior public school. That schooling demands the income of a professional woman. She must function in a competitive professional environment. She cannot afford to allow sentiment to hinder her career if she is to provide for her son. But her career is balanced on a knife edge. When Sammy and Maggie miss their school's field trip, due to Jack's cavalier attitude toward the school schedule, the children wind up complicating their parent's already hectic schedule. Jack Taylor definitely has some childlike qualities that both intrigue and annoy Melanie. These traits are what doomed her marriage and she cannot afford to fall for the same irresponsible type of man. She takes a while to realize that when the chips are down, Jack can bring considerable resources to bear on a problem. Jack adores his daughter but is ill equipped to provide a suitable home environment for a girl. Deep down, he realizes he desperately needs a good wife. This awareness makes Jack resist the allure of his coworker Celia, who would enjoy getting much closer to him. It was touching to watch the two children start to bond during their enforced togetherness at the day care center. Sammy starts to look after the welfare of Maggie when it would be easy to just consider himself. Melanie starts to apply her maternal care to Maggie as well as to her son. Jack starts to take an interest in Sammy, a boy who is desperate to have a father in his life. The bond between the parents grows in large measure from their growing attachment to each other's children. The unruly behavior of the two children was very realistic. Children in broken homes often develop such problems. A divorce impacts every aspect of a child's development. The film compresses the development of the romance into a single day. That is somewhat forced and unrealistic. Otherwise, this film is spot on and a joy to watch.

    'One fine Day' is a breezy romantic comedy with winning performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney. The plot is standard Hollywood fluff as both of them keep running into each other while trying to get their respective kids to a school field trip. Both Clooney and Pfeiffer are charming and share good chemistry with each other. If there's a fault, it's that the two remain apart for most of the running time. It would have been nice to see them sharing more screen time together. Still, the film is pleasant fun and well worth watching, specially as a date movie. Overall 7/10

    I was watching this movie mainly because I love Michelle pfieffer, shes my dream woman and one of my favorite actresses. But this movie just showed messed up lives of 2 single ultra busy parents. All they did through the entire film was run around, worried all the time, hectic beyond measure, dealing with a bunch of jerks, dealing with there kids. it just was too much. there was little to no romance except at the very end but the rest of the time pfieffer and Clooney are bitter, bickering, looking the other way all the time, talking on cell phones and it just lacked any real warmth between the 2. this isn't supposed to be frankie and johnny but it seems more like the PG13 version of that movie. perhaps some parts of it were funny, the rest of it was just a reminder of why I am glad I 1. am not a single parent 2. glad I don't live in the city with all these creeps 3. don't have to deal with all these super pressures with kids attached to the hip. everyone has'em, but it just made me kinda sad that both these people are divorced and just kinda draggin these kids around with no other parent to help them out. I mean, I understand the divorce rate is high today, but I would have rather seen a story of a divorced couple getting back together then these super busy workaholic dopes who have to drag there kids along every 2 minutes. they need both a mother and a father, not just one or the other being dragged around like rag dolls everywhere they go. Dad goes to work, mom stays home to raise the kids. this is ideally how it should be. not in this day and age apparently. this movie was in its own way showing the ridiculous stupid reality of today and was quite frankly depressing to witness. you don't get the feeling Clooney and pfieffers characters were going to be together very long after the credits role.

    Let's face it. There are several times during our everyday lives when we just need to...RELAX.In other words, we just need to de-compress,to spend some free time watching a funny,optimistic movie and escape from our anxieties and our problems even for a couple of hours. Well..."One Fine Day" fulfills this target perfectly. It's a really nice film, the story is simple and funny(similar to a screwball comedy),the lines are clever and the two stars ,Pfeiffer and Clooney,are very good at their roles. More precisely,they both play two single parents who are forced,due to the fact that their kids miss the school trip,to cooperate and spend almost an entire day together in order to compromise their demanding schedule at work and the care of their children. Jack(Clooney)is a cool,charming newspaper reporter and Melanie(Pfeiffer) is a clever,dynamic and slightly neurotic architect.Of course the attraction between them is obvious from the very first moment but since they don't admit the truth to each other, they spend the entire day flirting and creating a romantic and funny battle of the sexes. Like I said, it's a really nice film, that can cheer you up. Even though it deserves an 8/10, I give it a 10/10 because I think it's unfortunately underrated. Try it and relax!!!

    I had to watch this dreadful film on a bus ride. It's supposed to be a sweet romantic comedy with George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer but the film just falls short. They're both single parents in New York City and they are having the worst day or the best day. The film's writing is weak and the actors don't do anything for me. The film is really bad in my opinion and I can't stand George Clooney at all as obnoxious jerk of a Daily News reporter, Jack Taylor. Michelle Pfeiffer does better as an architect, single mother. The supporting cast is excellent except they're just acting their parts. The film is a lame attempt to talk about single parenting in the city. The supporting cast has Holland Taylor as Melanie's mother just like her role as Evelyn on television. Ellen Greene is barely recognizable as Elaine Lieberman but does a nice job. Charles Durning is wonderful as always as Jack's boss. Sheila Kelley plays Jack's ex. Pete Hamill, a well known New York City reporter, plays a New York City reporter by a different name. I don't know why they just didn't let him play himself. Pete Hamill is a New York City institution. Anyway, the film was done a few years before events changed New York City forever.

    I had heard of this film once before because of the leading actor and actress starring, and I am not one to turn the occasional possibly naff and cheesy but easy to like love story filled with giggle, from director Michael Hoffman (A Midsummer Night's Dream). Basically, in New York City, Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an architect and single mother to son Sammy (Home Alone 3's Alex D. Linz), Jack Taylor (George Clooney) is a New York Daily News columnist and single father to daughter Maggie (Independence Day's Mae Whitman), both of them are divorced. One fine day the two parents meet each other, morning time, and when both the children are late for the field trips they were meant to go, they are forced to join the parents during their hectic schedules, and make sure that they are cared for with their needs as well. Melanie must show an important client her architectural design presentation, and Sammy is causing havoc when he causes her to break her scale model, and in frustration she takes him to a daycare centre, holding a "Superhero Day". Jack is trying to get a scoop from Mayor Sidney Aikens (Sidney Armus) about his connections with the mob, and he is bringing Maggie to the daycare centre as well, and they have improvised superhero costumes made. Melanie is on her way to a meeting she gets a worrying phone call from her son about something to do with drugs, and in desperation she asks Jack, who she has the number of now, to get the kids, and he agrees as long as she has them at a time. Melanie breaks down while with the kids she loses Maggie, and she is forced to report the child missing, but thankfully she is found, and Jack is informed of this occurrence, but he makes it to the press conference to confront the Mayor and get his scoop. Sammy is looking forward to a soccer game that his father will hopefully be at, his mother insists she will have time to pitch her architecture idea to the clients at a restaurant, but she sacrifices it during, at risk of getting fired, for the sake of her child. The clients were actually impressed with her dedication to her child, and Sammy and Maggie make it to the soccer game, with Sammy's father indeed showing up, but not for long, as he is drumming for Bruce Springsteen. That evening Jack needs an excuse to go and see Melanie at her apartment, so he gets Maggie to buy a new goldfish to replace their other one that was eaten by the cat. While the children watch The Wizard of Oz together, Jack and Melanie seem to get on much better than they were in their hectic day, where they squabbled and were rushed, but they share a kiss, before falling asleep together on the sofa. Also starring The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning as Lew, Jon Robin Baitz as Yates Jr., Ellen Greene as Elaine Lieberman, Joe Grifasi as Manny Feldstein, Pete Hamill as Frank Burroughs and Anna Maria Horsford as Evelyn. Pfeiffer makes a convincing single mother who is forced into having to look after her often bratty child, Clooney is likable as the single father who ha a similar situation with his sweet daughter, Whitman is nice as the little girl, and I agree that Linz is a little less cute with his needy nature. For this theme of film, this actually works not just for the reasonable laughs and alright enough love story, but it is also a convincing portrait of the life of single parents, I will admit it could have had a more layered script, but it is an interesting enough romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "For The First Time" (also nominated the Golden Globe). Worth watching!

    The fine day of the title is ironic. In fact we are seeing a rainy day in chaotic New York, where a man and a woman, both divorced, are trying to fulfil their hectic schedules with their respective children in tow. The man is Jack Taylor, a high-flying reporter (George Clooney), and the woman is Melanie Parker, an equally ambitious architect (Michelle Pfeiffer). Due to a mix-up, the two children (excellently played by Mae Whitman & Alex Linz), miss out on a school trip, and the parents agree to share responsibilities between them. All sorts of mishaps befall them, including Melanie losing Jack's daughter for a while. The stress and strain results in much hostility and fault-finding between the two leads. Which fools nobody. We can see the result coming a mile off. This predictable movie certainly isn't the finest day of either Clooney or Pfeiffer. Both have made celluloads of better films. HOWEVER, it's a really enjoyable film to watch if you want the feelgood factor. Perhaps you have had a bad day, and it's raining outside. Watch this movie curled up on the sofa, with a cup of steaming cocoa. it's a nice lovable Hollywood romance. Clooney is Clooney, and Pfeiffer is always luminous even in her less demanding roles. And listen out for a meltingly beautiful performance of "One fine day" by Natalie Merchant (though it was the song "For the first time" that got Oscar-nominated).

    I had heard of this film once before because of the leading actor and actress starring, and I am not one to turn the occasional possibly naff and cheesy but easy to like love story filled with giggle, from director Michael Hoffman (A Midsummer Night's Dream). Basically, in New York City, Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an architect and single mother to son Sammy (Home Alone 3's Alex D. Linz), Jack Taylor (George Clooney) is a New York Daily News columnist and single father to daughter Maggie (Independence Day's Mae Whitman), both of them are divorced. One fine day the two parents meet each other, morning time, and when both the children are late for the field trips they were meant to go, they are forced to join the parents during their hectic schedules, and make sure that they are cared for with their needs as well. Melanie must show an important client her architectural design presentation, and Sammy is causing havoc when he causes her to break her scale model, and in frustration she takes him to a daycare centre, holding a "Superhero Day". Jack is trying to get a scoop from Mayor Sidney Aikens (Sidney Armus) about his connections with the mob, and he is bringing Maggie to the daycare centre as well, and they have improvised superhero costumes made. Melanie is on her way to a meeting she gets a worrying phone call from her son about something to do with drugs, and in desperation she asks Jack, who she has the number of now, to get the kids, and he agrees as long as she has them at a time. Melanie breaks down while with the kids she loses Maggie, and she is forced to report the child missing, but thankfully she is found, and Jack is informed of this occurrence, but he makes it to the press conference to confront the Mayor and get his scoop. Sammy is looking forward to a soccer game that his father will hopefully be at, his mother insists she will have time to pitch her architecture idea to the clients at a restaurant, but she sacrifices it during, at risk of getting fired, for the sake of her child. The clients were actually impressed with her dedication to her child, and Sammy and Maggie make it to the soccer game, with Sammy's father indeed showing up, but not for long, as he is drumming for Bruce Springsteen. That evening Jack needs an excuse to go and see Melanie at her apartment, so he gets Maggie to buy a new goldfish to replace their other one that was eaten by the cat. While the children watch The Wizard of Oz together, Jack and Melanie seem to get on much better than they were in their hectic day, where they squabbled and were rushed, but they share a kiss, before falling asleep together on the sofa. Also starring The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning as Lew, Jon Robin Baitz as Yates Jr., Ellen Greene as Elaine Lieberman, Joe Grifasi as Manny Feldstein, Pete Hamill as Frank Burroughs and Anna Maria Horsford as Evelyn. Pfeiffer makes a convincing single mother who is forced into having to look after her often bratty child, Clooney is likable as the single father who ha a similar situation with his sweet daughter, Whitman is nice as the little girl, and I agree that Linz is a little less cute with his needy nature. For this theme of film, this actually works not just for the reasonable laughs and alright enough love story, but it is also a convincing portrait of the life of single parents, I will admit it could have had a more layered script, but it is an interesting enough romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "For The First Time" (also nominated the Golden Globe). Worth watching!

    The fine day of the title is ironic. In fact we are seeing a rainy day in chaotic New York, where a man and a woman, both divorced, are trying to fulfil their hectic schedules with their respective children in tow. The man is Jack Taylor, a high-flying reporter (George Clooney), and the woman is Melanie Parker, an equally ambitious architect (Michelle Pfeiffer). Due to a mix-up, the two children (excellently played by Mae Whitman & Alex Linz), miss out on a school trip, and the parents agree to share responsibilities between them. All sorts of mishaps befall them, including Melanie losing Jack's daughter for a while. The stress and strain results in much hostility and fault-finding between the two leads. Which fools nobody. We can see the result coming a mile off. This predictable movie certainly isn't the finest day of either Clooney or Pfeiffer. Both have made celluloads of better films. HOWEVER, it's a really enjoyable film to watch if you want the feelgood factor. Perhaps you have had a bad day, and it's raining outside. Watch this movie curled up on the sofa, with a cup of steaming cocoa. it's a nice lovable Hollywood romance. Clooney is Clooney, and Pfeiffer is always luminous even in her less demanding roles. And listen out for a meltingly beautiful performance of "One fine day" by Natalie Merchant (though it was the song "For the first time" that got Oscar-nominated).

    Long gone are the days when I considered myself a romantic but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying this charming romantic comedy to a degree, even though it is a genre of film that I used to like better when I was younger. For a romantic comedy this one is fun and has some charm. It is romantic without being too lame or mushy stuff, although it still is cheesy at times. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer have perfect chemistry. So have the two kids, as good in their respective roles as the adults are on theirs. Despite all the fast pace and daily rush subject this films deals with, it still has room for classic humor, romance and a certain nostalgic/classic feeling to it thanks to oldie songs and the excellent scenario of New York city, making that city look perhaps better than it really is, especially now after the horrifying events of 11th September 2001. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer would make a good couple in real life, just like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner would. Their characters's rivalries are funny although they become frustrating after a while, but not profane or sadistic, they're just normal (if unnecessary) rivalries. This should please most fans of romantic comedies and might as well please (to a degree) some who are not into this type of film.

    Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com ! I watched this movie a long time back, when I was still in school. At that time I used to hate anything romantic, and would avoid it like the plague. So when my elder cousin bro and his wife booked tickets for this movie, I was thoroughly disappointed. To make things even worse, they had booked the late night show, where all the couples usually turn up. Now you know how much I would have wanted to hate this flick :p. However, as luck would have it, I actually ended up liking the movie quite a bit. In fact I remember feeling a bit guilty admitting that I actually enjoyed the movie. Twelve or maybe thirteen years down the line, I caught the movie once again a few days back, and I still enjoy this one as much as before. This is not your standard romantic comedies types. It is quite surreal, relatable and oh so cute! Perfect movie to watch or snuggle to, with that special someone. Either that, or I have managed to read the fairer sex very wrongly . Anyways let me know if you think otherwise :)

    This movie is wonderful. Really makes my heart happy every time I see it. I first saw it when I was 12, now at I'm 25 and I enjoy it even more. The story is amazingly simple and beautiful, a bit predictable indeed, but the feeling in the movie makes your heart sing, like a beautiful spring sunny day! All four actors :) are so sweet and natural, it's almost hard for me to imagine that they act and not.. just live one .. fine day. The children are so sweet .. the parents are lovely. I love this world after seeing this movie! Some of you might think that I overreacted, but it's just wonderful! Movie for open heart people!

    I loved this film! It captures perfectly the daily struggle of single parents coping imperfectly with the demands of raising their children. The background of a rainy springtime New York fit the mood perfectly. Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) opens the film dejectedly sitting at her desk writing checks to pay the many pressing bills. Her ex-husband is far more involved in his own pursuits than concern for his son. I suspect that Melanie is getting little financial support from a musician who works only intermittently. The blues really hit home when you get to the late hours and the distractions of earning a living are on temporary hold. It gets really hard not to dump on the absent spouse to preserve a child's relationship to the missing parent. Jack Taylor (George Clooney) lives in a wreck of an apartment that he has no ambition to repair. He has custody of his daughter every other weekend and he is able to get back at his ex-wife by forcing her to leave her daughter in a environment that totally offends her sense of order without being so ramshackle that she can get the courts to intervene. Lots of childish bickering between the parents accompany every custody weekend. Total realism in that scene where the daughter Maggie (Mae Whitman) is dropped off. Melanie is a woman who has been forced to become much more forceful than her nature would prefer. She has enrolled her son Sammy (Alex D. Linz) in a prestigious private school rather than the far inferior public school. That schooling demands the income of a professional woman. She must function in a competitive professional environment. She cannot afford to allow sentiment to hinder her career if she is to provide for her son. But her career is balanced on a knife edge. When Sammy and Maggie miss their school's field trip, due to Jack's cavalier attitude toward the school schedule, the children wind up complicating their parent's already hectic schedule. Jack Taylor definitely has some childlike qualities that both intrigue and annoy Melanie. These traits are what doomed her marriage and she cannot afford to fall for the same irresponsible type of man. She takes a while to realize that when the chips are down, Jack can bring considerable resources to bear on a problem. Jack adores his daughter but is ill equipped to provide a suitable home environment for a girl. Deep down, he realizes he desperately needs a good wife. This awareness makes Jack resist the allure of his coworker Celia, who would enjoy getting much closer to him. It was touching to watch the two children start to bond during their enforced togetherness at the day care center. Sammy starts to look after the welfare of Maggie when it would be easy to just consider himself. Melanie starts to apply her maternal care to Maggie as well as to her son. Jack starts to take an interest in Sammy, a boy who is desperate to have a father in his life. The bond between the parents grows in large measure from their growing attachment to each other's children. The unruly behavior of the two children was very realistic. Children in broken homes often develop such problems. A divorce impacts every aspect of a child's development. The film compresses the development of the romance into a single day. That is somewhat forced and unrealistic. Otherwise, this film is spot on and a joy to watch.

    'One fine Day' is a breezy romantic comedy with winning performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney. The plot is standard Hollywood fluff as both of them keep running into each other while trying to get their respective kids to a school field trip. Both Clooney and Pfeiffer are charming and share good chemistry with each other. If there's a fault, it's that the two remain apart for most of the running time. It would have been nice to see them sharing more screen time together. Still, the film is pleasant fun and well worth watching, specially as a date movie. Overall 7/10

    I was watching this movie mainly because I love Michelle pfieffer, shes my dream woman and one of my favorite actresses. But this movie just showed messed up lives of 2 single ultra busy parents. All they did through the entire film was run around, worried all the time, hectic beyond measure, dealing with a bunch of jerks, dealing with there kids. it just was too much. there was little to no romance except at the very end but the rest of the time pfieffer and Clooney are bitter, bickering, looking the other way all the time, talking on cell phones and it just lacked any real warmth between the 2. this isn't supposed to be frankie and johnny but it seems more like the PG13 version of that movie. perhaps some parts of it were funny, the rest of it was just a reminder of why I am glad I 1. am not a single parent 2. glad I don't live in the city with all these creeps 3. don't have to deal with all these super pressures with kids attached to the hip. everyone has'em, but it just made me kinda sad that both these people are divorced and just kinda draggin these kids around with no other parent to help them out. I mean, I understand the divorce rate is high today, but I would have rather seen a story of a divorced couple getting back together then these super busy workaholic dopes who have to drag there kids along every 2 minutes. they need both a mother and a father, not just one or the other being dragged around like rag dolls everywhere they go. Dad goes to work, mom stays home to raise the kids. this is ideally how it should be. not in this day and age apparently. this movie was in its own way showing the ridiculous stupid reality of today and was quite frankly depressing to witness. you don't get the feeling Clooney and pfieffers characters were going to be together very long after the credits role.

    Let's face it. There are several times during our everyday lives when we just need to...RELAX.In other words, we just need to de-compress,to spend some free time watching a funny,optimistic movie and escape from our anxieties and our problems even for a couple of hours. Well..."One Fine Day" fulfills this target perfectly. It's a really nice film, the story is simple and funny(similar to a screwball comedy),the lines are clever and the two stars ,Pfeiffer and Clooney,are very good at their roles. More precisely,they both play two single parents who are forced,due to the fact that their kids miss the school trip,to cooperate and spend almost an entire day together in order to compromise their demanding schedule at work and the care of their children. Jack(Clooney)is a cool,charming newspaper reporter and Melanie(Pfeiffer) is a clever,dynamic and slightly neurotic architect.Of course the attraction between them is obvious from the very first moment but since they don't admit the truth to each other, they spend the entire day flirting and creating a romantic and funny battle of the sexes. Like I said, it's a really nice film, that can cheer you up. Even though it deserves an 8/10, I give it a 10/10 because I think it's unfortunately underrated. Try it and relax!!!

    I had to watch this dreadful film on a bus ride. It's supposed to be a sweet romantic comedy with George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer but the film just falls short. They're both single parents in New York City and they are having the worst day or the best day. The film's writing is weak and the actors don't do anything for me. The film is really bad in my opinion and I can't stand George Clooney at all as obnoxious jerk of a Daily News reporter, Jack Taylor. Michelle Pfeiffer does better as an architect, single mother. The supporting cast is excellent except they're just acting their parts. The film is a lame attempt to talk about single parenting in the city. The supporting cast has Holland Taylor as Melanie's mother just like her role as Evelyn on television. Ellen Greene is barely recognizable as Elaine Lieberman but does a nice job. Charles Durning is wonderful as always as Jack's boss. Sheila Kelley plays Jack's ex. Pete Hamill, a well known New York City reporter, plays a New York City reporter by a different name. I don't know why they just didn't let him play himself. Pete Hamill is a New York City institution. Anyway, the film was done a few years before events changed New York City forever.

    I was watching this movie mainly because I love Michelle pfieffer, shes my dream woman and one of my favorite actresses. But this movie just showed messed up lives of 2 single ultra busy parents. All they did through the entire film was run around, worried all the time, hectic beyond measure, dealing with a bunch of jerks, dealing with there kids. it just was too much. there was little to no romance except at the very end but the rest of the time pfieffer and Clooney are bitter, bickering, looking the other way all the time, talking on cell phones and it just lacked any real warmth between the 2. this isn't supposed to be frankie and johnny but it seems more like the PG13 version of that movie. perhaps some parts of it were funny, the rest of it was just a reminder of why I am glad I 1. am not a single parent 2. glad I don't live in the city with all these creeps 3. don't have to deal with all these super pressures with kids attached to the hip. everyone has'em, but it just made me kinda sad that both these people are divorced and just kinda draggin these kids around with no other parent to help them out. I mean, I understand the divorce rate is high today, but I would have rather seen a story of a divorced couple getting back together then these super busy workaholic dopes who have to drag there kids along every 2 minutes. they need both a mother and a father, not just one or the other being dragged around like rag dolls everywhere they go. Dad goes to work, mom stays home to raise the kids. this is ideally how it should be. not in this day and age apparently. this movie was in its own way showing the ridiculous stupid reality of today and was quite frankly depressing to witness. you don't get the feeling Clooney and pfieffers characters were going to be together very long after the credits role.

    Let's face it. There are several times during our everyday lives when we just need to...RELAX.In other words, we just need to de-compress,to spend some free time watching a funny,optimistic movie and escape from our anxieties and our problems even for a couple of hours. Well..."One Fine Day" fulfills this target perfectly. It's a really nice film, the story is simple and funny(similar to a screwball comedy),the lines are clever and the two stars ,Pfeiffer and Clooney,are very good at their roles. More precisely,they both play two single parents who are forced,due to the fact that their kids miss the school trip,to cooperate and spend almost an entire day together in order to compromise their demanding schedule at work and the care of their children. Jack(Clooney)is a cool,charming newspaper reporter and Melanie(Pfeiffer) is a clever,dynamic and slightly neurotic architect.Of course the attraction between them is obvious from the very first moment but since they don't admit the truth to each other, they spend the entire day flirting and creating a romantic and funny battle of the sexes. Like I said, it's a really nice film, that can cheer you up. Even though it deserves an 8/10, I give it a 10/10 because I think it's unfortunately underrated. Try it and relax!!!

    I had to watch this dreadful film on a bus ride. It's supposed to be a sweet romantic comedy with George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer but the film just falls short. They're both single parents in New York City and they are having the worst day or the best day. The film's writing is weak and the actors don't do anything for me. The film is really bad in my opinion and I can't stand George Clooney at all as obnoxious jerk of a Daily News reporter, Jack Taylor. Michelle Pfeiffer does better as an architect, single mother. The supporting cast is excellent except they're just acting their parts. The film is a lame attempt to talk about single parenting in the city. The supporting cast has Holland Taylor as Melanie's mother just like her role as Evelyn on television. Ellen Greene is barely recognizable as Elaine Lieberman but does a nice job. Charles Durning is wonderful as always as Jack's boss. Sheila Kelley plays Jack's ex. Pete Hamill, a well known New York City reporter, plays a New York City reporter by a different name. I don't know why they just didn't let him play himself. Pete Hamill is a New York City institution. Anyway, the film was done a few years before events changed New York City forever.

    I had heard of this film once before because of the leading actor and actress starring, and I am not one to turn the occasional possibly naff and cheesy but easy to like love story filled with giggle, from director Michael Hoffman (A Midsummer Night's Dream). Basically, in New York City, Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an architect and single mother to son Sammy (Home Alone 3's Alex D. Linz), Jack Taylor (George Clooney) is a New York Daily News columnist and single father to daughter Maggie (Independence Day's Mae Whitman), both of them are divorced. One fine day the two parents meet each other, morning time, and when both the children are late for the field trips they were meant to go, they are forced to join the parents during their hectic schedules, and make sure that they are cared for with their needs as well. Melanie must show an important client her architectural design presentation, and Sammy is causing havoc when he causes her to break her scale model, and in frustration she takes him to a daycare centre, holding a "Superhero Day". Jack is trying to get a scoop from Mayor Sidney Aikens (Sidney Armus) about his connections with the mob, and he is bringing Maggie to the daycare centre as well, and they have improvised superhero costumes made. Melanie is on her way to a meeting she gets a worrying phone call from her son about something to do with drugs, and in desperation she asks Jack, who she has the number of now, to get the kids, and he agrees as long as she has them at a time. Melanie breaks down while with the kids she loses Maggie, and she is forced to report the child missing, but thankfully she is found, and Jack is informed of this occurrence, but he makes it to the press conference to confront the Mayor and get his scoop. Sammy is looking forward to a soccer game that his father will hopefully be at, his mother insists she will have time to pitch her architecture idea to the clients at a restaurant, but she sacrifices it during, at risk of getting fired, for the sake of her child. The clients were actually impressed with her dedication to her child, and Sammy and Maggie make it to the soccer game, with Sammy's father indeed showing up, but not for long, as he is drumming for Bruce Springsteen. That evening Jack needs an excuse to go and see Melanie at her apartment, so he gets Maggie to buy a new goldfish to replace their other one that was eaten by the cat. While the children watch The Wizard of Oz together, Jack and Melanie seem to get on much better than they were in their hectic day, where they squabbled and were rushed, but they share a kiss, before falling asleep together on the sofa. Also starring The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning as Lew, Jon Robin Baitz as Yates Jr., Ellen Greene as Elaine Lieberman, Joe Grifasi as Manny Feldstein, Pete Hamill as Frank Burroughs and Anna Maria Horsford as Evelyn. Pfeiffer makes a convincing single mother who is forced into having to look after her often bratty child, Clooney is likable as the single father who ha a similar situation with his sweet daughter, Whitman is nice as the little girl, and I agree that Linz is a little less cute with his needy nature. For this theme of film, this actually works not just for the reasonable laughs and alright enough love story, but it is also a convincing portrait of the life of single parents, I will admit it could have had a more layered script, but it is an interesting enough romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "For The First Time" (also nominated the Golden Globe). Worth watching!

    The fine day of the title is ironic. In fact we are seeing a rainy day in chaotic New York, where a man and a woman, both divorced, are trying to fulfil their hectic schedules with their respective children in tow. The man is Jack Taylor, a high-flying reporter (George Clooney), and the woman is Melanie Parker, an equally ambitious architect (Michelle Pfeiffer). Due to a mix-up, the two children (excellently played by Mae Whitman & Alex Linz), miss out on a school trip, and the parents agree to share responsibilities between them. All sorts of mishaps befall them, including Melanie losing Jack's daughter for a while. The stress and strain results in much hostility and fault-finding between the two leads. Which fools nobody. We can see the result coming a mile off. This predictable movie certainly isn't the finest day of either Clooney or Pfeiffer. Both have made celluloads of better films. HOWEVER, it's a really enjoyable film to watch if you want the feelgood factor. Perhaps you have had a bad day, and it's raining outside. Watch this movie curled up on the sofa, with a cup of steaming cocoa. it's a nice lovable Hollywood romance. Clooney is Clooney, and Pfeiffer is always luminous even in her less demanding roles. And listen out for a meltingly beautiful performance of "One fine day" by Natalie Merchant (though it was the song "For the first time" that got Oscar-nominated).

    Long gone are the days when I considered myself a romantic but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying this charming romantic comedy to a degree, even though it is a genre of film that I used to like better when I was younger. For a romantic comedy this one is fun and has some charm. It is romantic without being too lame or mushy stuff, although it still is cheesy at times. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer have perfect chemistry. So have the two kids, as good in their respective roles as the adults are on theirs. Despite all the fast pace and daily rush subject this films deals with, it still has room for classic humor, romance and a certain nostalgic/classic feeling to it thanks to oldie songs and the excellent scenario of New York city, making that city look perhaps better than it really is, especially now after the horrifying events of 11th September 2001. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer would make a good couple in real life, just like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner would. Their characters's rivalries are funny although they become frustrating after a while, but not profane or sadistic, they're just normal (if unnecessary) rivalries. This should please most fans of romantic comedies and might as well please (to a degree) some who are not into this type of film.

    Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com ! I watched this movie a long time back, when I was still in school. At that time I used to hate anything romantic, and would avoid it like the plague. So when my elder cousin bro and his wife booked tickets for this movie, I was thoroughly disappointed. To make things even worse, they had booked the late night show, where all the couples usually turn up. Now you know how much I would have wanted to hate this flick :p. However, as luck would have it, I actually ended up liking the movie quite a bit. In fact I remember feeling a bit guilty admitting that I actually enjoyed the movie. Twelve or maybe thirteen years down the line, I caught the movie once again a few days back, and I still enjoy this one as much as before. This is not your standard romantic comedies types. It is quite surreal, relatable and oh so cute! Perfect movie to watch or snuggle to, with that special someone. Either that, or I have managed to read the fairer sex very wrongly . Anyways let me know if you think otherwise :)

    This movie is wonderful. Really makes my heart happy every time I see it. I first saw it when I was 12, now at I'm 25 and I enjoy it even more. The story is amazingly simple and beautiful, a bit predictable indeed, but the feeling in the movie makes your heart sing, like a beautiful spring sunny day! All four actors :) are so sweet and natural, it's almost hard for me to imagine that they act and not.. just live one .. fine day. The children are so sweet .. the parents are lovely. I love this world after seeing this movie! Some of you might think that I overreacted, but it's just wonderful! Movie for open heart people!

    I loved this film! It captures perfectly the daily struggle of single parents coping imperfectly with the demands of raising their children. The background of a rainy springtime New York fit the mood perfectly. Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) opens the film dejectedly sitting at her desk writing checks to pay the many pressing bills. Her ex-husband is far more involved in his own pursuits than concern for his son. I suspect that Melanie is getting little financial support from a musician who works only intermittently. The blues really hit home when you get to the late hours and the distractions of earning a living are on temporary hold. It gets really hard not to dump on the absent spouse to preserve a child's relationship to the missing parent. Jack Taylor (George Clooney) lives in a wreck of an apartment that he has no ambition to repair. He has custody of his daughter every other weekend and he is able to get back at his ex-wife by forcing her to leave her daughter in a environment that totally offends her sense of order without being so ramshackle that she can get the courts to intervene. Lots of childish bickering between the parents accompany every custody weekend. Total realism in that scene where the daughter Maggie (Mae Whitman) is dropped off. Melanie is a woman who has been forced to become much more forceful than her nature would prefer. She has enrolled her son Sammy (Alex D. Linz) in a prestigious private school rather than the far inferior public school. That schooling demands the income of a professional woman. She must function in a competitive professional environment. She cannot afford to allow sentiment to hinder her career if she is to provide for her son. But her career is balanced on a knife edge. When Sammy and Maggie miss their school's field trip, due to Jack's cavalier attitude toward the school schedule, the children wind up complicating their parent's already hectic schedule. Jack Taylor definitely has some childlike qualities that both intrigue and annoy Melanie. These traits are what doomed her marriage and she cannot afford to fall for the same irresponsible type of man. She takes a while to realize that when the chips are down, Jack can bring considerable resources to bear on a problem. Jack adores his daughter but is ill equipped to provide a suitable home environment for a girl. Deep down, he realizes he desperately needs a good wife. This awareness makes Jack resist the allure of his coworker Celia, who would enjoy getting much closer to him. It was touching to watch the two children start to bond during their enforced togetherness at the day care center. Sammy starts to look after the welfare of Maggie when it would be easy to just consider himself. Melanie starts to apply her maternal care to Maggie as well as to her son. Jack starts to take an interest in Sammy, a boy who is desperate to have a father in his life. The bond between the parents grows in large measure from their growing attachment to each other's children. The unruly behavior of the two children was very realistic. Children in broken homes often develop such problems. A divorce impacts every aspect of a child's development. The film compresses the development of the romance into a single day. That is somewhat forced and unrealistic. Otherwise, this film is spot on and a joy to watch.

    'One fine Day' is a breezy romantic comedy with winning performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney. The plot is standard Hollywood fluff as both of them keep running into each other while trying to get their respective kids to a school field trip. Both Clooney and Pfeiffer are charming and share good chemistry with each other. If there's a fault, it's that the two remain apart for most of the running time. It would have been nice to see them sharing more screen time together. Still, the film is pleasant fun and well worth watching, specially as a date movie. Overall 7/10

    This movie is wonderful. Really makes my heart happy every time I see it. I first saw it when I was 12, now at I'm 25 and I enjoy it even more. The story is amazingly simple and beautiful, a bit predictable indeed, but the feeling in the movie makes your heart sing, like a beautiful spring sunny day! All four actors :) are so sweet and natural, it's almost hard for me to imagine that they act and not.. just live one .. fine day. The children are so sweet .. the parents are lovely. I love this world after seeing this movie! Some of you might think that I overreacted, but it's just wonderful! Movie for open heart people!

    I loved this film! It captures perfectly the daily struggle of single parents coping imperfectly with the demands of raising their children. The background of a rainy springtime New York fit the mood perfectly. Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) opens the film dejectedly sitting at her desk writing checks to pay the many pressing bills. Her ex-husband is far more involved in his own pursuits than concern for his son. I suspect that Melanie is getting little financial support from a musician who works only intermittently. The blues really hit home when you get to the late hours and the distractions of earning a living are on temporary hold. It gets really hard not to dump on the absent spouse to preserve a child's relationship to the missing parent. Jack Taylor (George Clooney) lives in a wreck of an apartment that he has no ambition to repair. He has custody of his daughter every other weekend and he is able to get back at his ex-wife by forcing her to leave her daughter in a environment that totally offends her sense of order without being so ramshackle that she can get the courts to intervene. Lots of childish bickering between the parents accompany every custody weekend. Total realism in that scene where the daughter Maggie (Mae Whitman) is dropped off. Melanie is a woman who has been forced to become much more forceful than her nature would prefer. She has enrolled her son Sammy (Alex D. Linz) in a prestigious private school rather than the far inferior public school. That schooling demands the income of a professional woman. She must function in a competitive professional environment. She cannot afford to allow sentiment to hinder her career if she is to provide for her son. But her career is balanced on a knife edge. When Sammy and Maggie miss their school's field trip, due to Jack's cavalier attitude toward the school schedule, the children wind up complicating their parent's already hectic schedule. Jack Taylor definitely has some childlike qualities that both intrigue and annoy Melanie. These traits are what doomed her marriage and she cannot afford to fall for the same irresponsible type of man. She takes a while to realize that when the chips are down, Jack can bring considerable resources to bear on a problem. Jack adores his daughter but is ill equipped to provide a suitable home environment for a girl. Deep down, he realizes he desperately needs a good wife. This awareness makes Jack resist the allure of his coworker Celia, who would enjoy getting much closer to him. It was touching to watch the two children start to bond during their enforced togetherness at the day care center. Sammy starts to look after the welfare of Maggie when it would be easy to just consider himself. Melanie starts to apply her maternal care to Maggie as well as to her son. Jack starts to take an interest in Sammy, a boy who is desperate to have a father in his life. The bond between the parents grows in large measure from their growing attachment to each other's children. The unruly behavior of the two children was very realistic. Children in broken homes often develop such problems. A divorce impacts every aspect of a child's development. The film compresses the development of the romance into a single day. That is somewhat forced and unrealistic. Otherwise, this film is spot on and a joy to watch.

    'One fine Day' is a breezy romantic comedy with winning performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney. The plot is standard Hollywood fluff as both of them keep running into each other while trying to get their respective kids to a school field trip. Both Clooney and Pfeiffer are charming and share good chemistry with each other. If there's a fault, it's that the two remain apart for most of the running time. It would have been nice to see them sharing more screen time together. Still, the film is pleasant fun and well worth watching, specially as a date movie. Overall 7/10

    I was watching this movie mainly because I love Michelle pfieffer, shes my dream woman and one of my favorite actresses. But this movie just showed messed up lives of 2 single ultra busy parents. All they did through the entire film was run around, worried all the time, hectic beyond measure, dealing with a bunch of jerks, dealing with there kids. it just was too much. there was little to no romance except at the very end but the rest of the time pfieffer and Clooney are bitter, bickering, looking the other way all the time, talking on cell phones and it just lacked any real warmth between the 2. this isn't supposed to be frankie and johnny but it seems more like the PG13 version of that movie. perhaps some parts of it were funny, the rest of it was just a reminder of why I am glad I 1. am not a single parent 2. glad I don't live in the city with all these creeps 3. don't have to deal with all these super pressures with kids attached to the hip. everyone has'em, but it just made me kinda sad that both these people are divorced and just kinda draggin these kids around with no other parent to help them out. I mean, I understand the divorce rate is high today, but I would have rather seen a story of a divorced couple getting back together then these super busy workaholic dopes who have to drag there kids along every 2 minutes. they need both a mother and a father, not just one or the other being dragged around like rag dolls everywhere they go. Dad goes to work, mom stays home to raise the kids. this is ideally how it should be. not in this day and age apparently. this movie was in its own way showing the ridiculous stupid reality of today and was quite frankly depressing to witness. you don't get the feeling Clooney and pfieffers characters were going to be together very long after the credits role.

    Let's face it. There are several times during our everyday lives when we just need to...RELAX.In other words, we just need to de-compress,to spend some free time watching a funny,optimistic movie and escape from our anxieties and our problems even for a couple of hours. Well..."One Fine Day" fulfills this target perfectly. It's a really nice film, the story is simple and funny(similar to a screwball comedy),the lines are clever and the two stars ,Pfeiffer and Clooney,are very good at their roles. More precisely,they both play two single parents who are forced,due to the fact that their kids miss the school trip,to cooperate and spend almost an entire day together in order to compromise their demanding schedule at work and the care of their children. Jack(Clooney)is a cool,charming newspaper reporter and Melanie(Pfeiffer) is a clever,dynamic and slightly neurotic architect.Of course the attraction between them is obvious from the very first moment but since they don't admit the truth to each other, they spend the entire day flirting and creating a romantic and funny battle of the sexes. Like I said, it's a really nice film, that can cheer you up. Even though it deserves an 8/10, I give it a 10/10 because I think it's unfortunately underrated. Try it and relax!!!

    I had to watch this dreadful film on a bus ride. It's supposed to be a sweet romantic comedy with George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer but the film just falls short. They're both single parents in New York City and they are having the worst day or the best day. The film's writing is weak and the actors don't do anything for me. The film is really bad in my opinion and I can't stand George Clooney at all as obnoxious jerk of a Daily News reporter, Jack Taylor. Michelle Pfeiffer does better as an architect, single mother. The supporting cast is excellent except they're just acting their parts. The film is a lame attempt to talk about single parenting in the city. The supporting cast has Holland Taylor as Melanie's mother just like her role as Evelyn on television. Ellen Greene is barely recognizable as Elaine Lieberman but does a nice job. Charles Durning is wonderful as always as Jack's boss. Sheila Kelley plays Jack's ex. Pete Hamill, a well known New York City reporter, plays a New York City reporter by a different name. I don't know why they just didn't let him play himself. Pete Hamill is a New York City institution. Anyway, the film was done a few years before events changed New York City forever.

    I had heard of this film once before because of the leading actor and actress starring, and I am not one to turn the occasional possibly naff and cheesy but easy to like love story filled with giggle, from director Michael Hoffman (A Midsummer Night's Dream). Basically, in New York City, Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an architect and single mother to son Sammy (Home Alone 3's Alex D. Linz), Jack Taylor (George Clooney) is a New York Daily News columnist and single father to daughter Maggie (Independence Day's Mae Whitman), both of them are divorced. One fine day the two parents meet each other, morning time, and when both the children are late for the field trips they were meant to go, they are forced to join the parents during their hectic schedules, and make sure that they are cared for with their needs as well. Melanie must show an important client her architectural design presentation, and Sammy is causing havoc when he causes her to break her scale model, and in frustration she takes him to a daycare centre, holding a "Superhero Day". Jack is trying to get a scoop from Mayor Sidney Aikens (Sidney Armus) about his connections with the mob, and he is bringing Maggie to the daycare centre as well, and they have improvised superhero costumes made. Melanie is on her way to a meeting she gets a worrying phone call from her son about something to do with drugs, and in desperation she asks Jack, who she has the number of now, to get the kids, and he agrees as long as she has them at a time. Melanie breaks down while with the kids she loses Maggie, and she is forced to report the child missing, but thankfully she is found, and Jack is informed of this occurrence, but he makes it to the press conference to confront the Mayor and get his scoop. Sammy is looking forward to a soccer game that his father will hopefully be at, his mother insists she will have time to pitch her architecture idea to the clients at a restaurant, but she sacrifices it during, at risk of getting fired, for the sake of her child. The clients were actually impressed with her dedication to her child, and Sammy and Maggie make it to the soccer game, with Sammy's father indeed showing up, but not for long, as he is drumming for Bruce Springsteen. That evening Jack needs an excuse to go and see Melanie at her apartment, so he gets Maggie to buy a new goldfish to replace their other one that was eaten by the cat. While the children watch The Wizard of Oz together, Jack and Melanie seem to get on much better than they were in their hectic day, where they squabbled and were rushed, but they share a kiss, before falling asleep together on the sofa. Also starring The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning as Lew, Jon Robin Baitz as Yates Jr., Ellen Greene as Elaine Lieberman, Joe Grifasi as Manny Feldstein, Pete Hamill as Frank Burroughs and Anna Maria Horsford as Evelyn. Pfeiffer makes a convincing single mother who is forced into having to look after her often bratty child, Clooney is likable as the single father who ha a similar situation with his sweet daughter, Whitman is nice as the little girl, and I agree that Linz is a little less cute with his needy nature. For this theme of film, this actually works not just for the reasonable laughs and alright enough love story, but it is also a convincing portrait of the life of single parents, I will admit it could have had a more layered script, but it is an interesting enough romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "For The First Time" (also nominated the Golden Globe). Worth watching!

    The fine day of the title is ironic. In fact we are seeing a rainy day in chaotic New York, where a man and a woman, both divorced, are trying to fulfil their hectic schedules with their respective children in tow. The man is Jack Taylor, a high-flying reporter (George Clooney), and the woman is Melanie Parker, an equally ambitious architect (Michelle Pfeiffer). Due to a mix-up, the two children (excellently played by Mae Whitman & Alex Linz), miss out on a school trip, and the parents agree to share responsibilities between them. All sorts of mishaps befall them, including Melanie losing Jack's daughter for a while. The stress and strain results in much hostility and fault-finding between the two leads. Which fools nobody. We can see the result coming a mile off. This predictable movie certainly isn't the finest day of either Clooney or Pfeiffer. Both have made celluloads of better films. HOWEVER, it's a really enjoyable film to watch if you want the feelgood factor. Perhaps you have had a bad day, and it's raining outside. Watch this movie curled up on the sofa, with a cup of steaming cocoa. it's a nice lovable Hollywood romance. Clooney is Clooney, and Pfeiffer is always luminous even in her less demanding roles. And listen out for a meltingly beautiful performance of "One fine day" by Natalie Merchant (though it was the song "For the first time" that got Oscar-nominated).

    Long gone are the days when I considered myself a romantic but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying this charming romantic comedy to a degree, even though it is a genre of film that I used to like better when I was younger. For a romantic comedy this one is fun and has some charm. It is romantic without being too lame or mushy stuff, although it still is cheesy at times. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer have perfect chemistry. So have the two kids, as good in their respective roles as the adults are on theirs. Despite all the fast pace and daily rush subject this films deals with, it still has room for classic humor, romance and a certain nostalgic/classic feeling to it thanks to oldie songs and the excellent scenario of New York city, making that city look perhaps better than it really is, especially now after the horrifying events of 11th September 2001. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer would make a good couple in real life, just like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner would. Their characters's rivalries are funny although they become frustrating after a while, but not profane or sadistic, they're just normal (if unnecessary) rivalries. This should please most fans of romantic comedies and might as well please (to a degree) some who are not into this type of film.

    Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com ! I watched this movie a long time back, when I was still in school. At that time I used to hate anything romantic, and would avoid it like the plague. So when my elder cousin bro and his wife booked tickets for this movie, I was thoroughly disappointed. To make things even worse, they had booked the late night show, where all the couples usually turn up. Now you know how much I would have wanted to hate this flick :p. However, as luck would have it, I actually ended up liking the movie quite a bit. In fact I remember feeling a bit guilty admitting that I actually enjoyed the movie. Twelve or maybe thirteen years down the line, I caught the movie once again a few days back, and I still enjoy this one as much as before. This is not your standard romantic comedies types. It is quite surreal, relatable and oh so cute! Perfect movie to watch or snuggle to, with that special someone. Either that, or I have managed to read the fairer sex very wrongly . Anyways let me know if you think otherwise :)

    The fine day of the title is ironic. In fact we are seeing a rainy day in chaotic New York, where a man and a woman, both divorced, are trying to fulfil their hectic schedules with their respective children in tow. The man is Jack Taylor, a high-flying reporter (George Clooney), and the woman is Melanie Parker, an equally ambitious architect (Michelle Pfeiffer). Due to a mix-up, the two children (excellently played by Mae Whitman & Alex Linz), miss out on a school trip, and the parents agree to share responsibilities between them. All sorts of mishaps befall them, including Melanie losing Jack's daughter for a while. The stress and strain results in much hostility and fault-finding between the two leads. Which fools nobody. We can see the result coming a mile off. This predictable movie certainly isn't the finest day of either Clooney or Pfeiffer. Both have made celluloads of better films. HOWEVER, it's a really enjoyable film to watch if you want the feelgood factor. Perhaps you have had a bad day, and it's raining outside. Watch this movie curled up on the sofa, with a cup of steaming cocoa. it's a nice lovable Hollywood romance. Clooney is Clooney, and Pfeiffer is always luminous even in her less demanding roles. And listen out for a meltingly beautiful performance of "One fine day" by Natalie Merchant (though it was the song "For the first time" that got Oscar-nominated).

    Predictable like any romantic comedy, but unlike most of them, this one has some surprises

    Long gone are the days when I considered myself a romantic but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying this charming romantic comedy to a degree, even though it is a genre of film that I used to like better when I was younger. For a romantic comedy this one is fun and has some charm. It is romantic without being too lame or mushy stuff, although it still is cheesy at times. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer have perfect chemistry. So have the two kids, as good in their respective roles as the adults are on theirs. Despite all the fast pace and daily rush subject this films deals with, it still has room for classic humor, romance and a certain nostalgic/classic feeling to it thanks to oldie songs and the excellent scenario of New York city, making that city look perhaps better than it really is, especially now after the horrifying events of 11th September 2001. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer would make a good couple in real life, just like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner would. Their characters's rivalries are funny although they become frustrating after a while, but not profane or sadistic, they're just normal (if unnecessary) rivalries. This should please most fans of romantic comedies and might as well please (to a degree) some who are not into this type of film.

    Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com ! I watched this movie a long time back, when I was still in school. At that time I used to hate anything romantic, and would avoid it like the plague. So when my elder cousin bro and his wife booked tickets for this movie, I was thoroughly disappointed. To make things even worse, they had booked the late night show, where all the couples usually turn up. Now you know how much I would have wanted to hate this flick :p. However, as luck would have it, I actually ended up liking the movie quite a bit. In fact I remember feeling a bit guilty admitting that I actually enjoyed the movie. Twelve or maybe thirteen years down the line, I caught the movie once again a few days back, and I still enjoy this one as much as before. This is not your standard romantic comedies types. It is quite surreal, relatable and oh so cute! Perfect movie to watch or snuggle to, with that special someone. Either that, or I have managed to read the fairer sex very wrongly . Anyways let me know if you think otherwise :)

    This movie is wonderful. Really makes my heart happy every time I see it. I first saw it when I was 12, now at I'm 25 and I enjoy it even more. The story is amazingly simple and beautiful, a bit predictable indeed, but the feeling in the movie makes your heart sing, like a beautiful spring sunny day! All four actors :) are so sweet and natural, it's almost hard for me to imagine that they act and not.. just live one .. fine day. The children are so sweet .. the parents are lovely. I love this world after seeing this movie! Some of you might think that I overreacted, but it's just wonderful! Movie for open heart people!

    I loved this film! It captures perfectly the daily struggle of single parents coping imperfectly with the demands of raising their children. The background of a rainy springtime New York fit the mood perfectly. Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) opens the film dejectedly sitting at her desk writing checks to pay the many pressing bills. Her ex-husband is far more involved in his own pursuits than concern for his son. I suspect that Melanie is getting little financial support from a musician who works only intermittently. The blues really hit home when you get to the late hours and the distractions of earning a living are on temporary hold. It gets really hard not to dump on the absent spouse to preserve a child's relationship to the missing parent. Jack Taylor (George Clooney) lives in a wreck of an apartment that he has no ambition to repair. He has custody of his daughter every other weekend and he is able to get back at his ex-wife by forcing her to leave her daughter in a environment that totally offends her sense of order without being so ramshackle that she can get the courts to intervene. Lots of childish bickering between the parents accompany every custody weekend. Total realism in that scene where the daughter Maggie (Mae Whitman) is dropped off. Melanie is a woman who has been forced to become much more forceful than her nature would prefer. She has enrolled her son Sammy (Alex D. Linz) in a prestigious private school rather than the far inferior public school. That schooling demands the income of a professional woman. She must function in a competitive professional environment. She cannot afford to allow sentiment to hinder her career if she is to provide for her son. But her career is balanced on a knife edge. When Sammy and Maggie miss their school's field trip, due to Jack's cavalier attitude toward the school schedule, the children wind up complicating their parent's already hectic schedule. Jack Taylor definitely has some childlike qualities that both intrigue and annoy Melanie. These traits are what doomed her marriage and she cannot afford to fall for the same irresponsible type of man. She takes a while to realize that when the chips are down, Jack can bring considerable resources to bear on a problem. Jack adores his daughter but is ill equipped to provide a suitable home environment for a girl. Deep down, he realizes he desperately needs a good wife. This awareness makes Jack resist the allure of his coworker Celia, who would enjoy getting much closer to him. It was touching to watch the two children start to bond during their enforced togetherness at the day care center. Sammy starts to look after the welfare of Maggie when it would be easy to just consider himself. Melanie starts to apply her maternal care to Maggie as well as to her son. Jack starts to take an interest in Sammy, a boy who is desperate to have a father in his life. The bond between the parents grows in large measure from their growing attachment to each other's children. The unruly behavior of the two children was very realistic. Children in broken homes often develop such problems. A divorce impacts every aspect of a child's development. The film compresses the development of the romance into a single day. That is somewhat forced and unrealistic. Otherwise, this film is spot on and a joy to watch.

    'One fine Day' is a breezy romantic comedy with winning performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney. The plot is standard Hollywood fluff as both of them keep running into each other while trying to get their respective kids to a school field trip. Both Clooney and Pfeiffer are charming and share good chemistry with each other. If there's a fault, it's that the two remain apart for most of the running time. It would have been nice to see them sharing more screen time together. Still, the film is pleasant fun and well worth watching, specially as a date movie. Overall 7/10
