 <sinopse>
  The wife of an oafish restaurant owner becomes bored with her husband and considers an affair with a regular patron.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The wife of a barbaric crime boss engages in a secretive romance with a gentle bookseller between meals at her husband's restaurant. Food, colour coding, sex, murder, torture and cannibalism are the exotic fare in this beautifully filmed but brutally uncompromising modern fable which has been interpreted as an allegory for Thatcherism.

    I have a problem with art-house films like THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER and it's that the directors of such fare are often totally ignorant when it comes to decent film-making. Sure, they obsess over designer costumes and make-up, and they focus intently on the colour palette of their movies, but when it comes to movie-making staples like pace, character, dialogue, and intrigue, they fail. Peter Greenaway is such a director. This controversial 1989 opus is known for its gruesome scenes of cannibalism, yet take away the controversy and there's absolutely nothing here to rate this. The running time is as slow as a snail, and much of it is made up of scenes of the repulsive Michael Gambon character berating his wife and associates. Greenaway's a better director than he is a writer, because the script is terrible. We get the gist of Gambon's character and the situation with his wife in the first ten minutes, yet two hours of non-action go by in which we're bludgeoned over the head with his sheer monotonous brutish nature. The whole film takes place on a cheap-looking set that quickly becomes boring, Helen Mirren spends most of the running time naked and forgets how to act, and luminaries such as Tim Roth and Ciaran Hinds are wasted. Yes, there are a few shocking scenes, yet cannibalism is dealt with in a much more entertaining fashion in both B-movie fare (such as Pete Walker's 1974 FRIGHTMARE) and Hollywood flicks (like RAVENOUS). I'm not against arty films where nothing happens, but there has to be substance to go with the style; Nic Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW is a case in point: one of my favourite films of all time, but hardly action-packed. THE COOK... just wastes a great deal of potential and proves to be another case of The Emperor's New Clothes.

    I love the visual style of this film; it's very theatrical but with huge backdrops; some of the scenes in the restaurant almost look like they're filmed in an aircraft hanger. The use of colour is quite brilliant, even down to the actor's costume changing colour as they move from room to room. I thought the music fitted the piece quite brilliantly too (aside from the operatic stuff  those that have seen it will know what I'm referring to). All the performances were excellent; in particular Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon; they both really shone in this one! It's certainly one I'll be seeing again sometime and one I heartily recommend although some may find certain scenes distasteful (definitely not for the youngsters!). SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.9/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    I heard about this film because of its sexual content and a few of the actors starring before finding out it one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die in the book of the same name, so that made me even more keen to see it. Basically high-class Le Hollandais Restaurant, run by French chef Richard Borst, the Cook (Richard Bohringer) has been taken over by vicious, malevolent and sadistic English gangster Albert Spica, the Thief (Sir Michael Gambon), and he makes numerous nightly appearances at the restaurant as host to dining parties of fellow thugs. With no interest and respect for the feelings and integrity of his staff and customers Spica's despicable behaviour causes many confrontations and he loses some of their company, but he gets away with taking their money. The one who suffers the most from his intolerable attitude is his finely bred and beautiful spouse Georgina Spica, the Wife (Dame Helen Mirren) who is forced into joining in his activities, and she often is victim to his abusive comments and occasional disrespectful actions. She has obviously had enough, and she soon enough catches the eye of and starts a passionate affair with bookshop owner and regular restaurant customer Michael, the Lover (Alan Howard), and with the help of the staff she manages to continue it right under her husband's nose. Eventually Spica does find out about the affair, and despite having no clothes Georgina and Michael escape from his raging tirade in the back of a truck containing rotting meat and vegetables, and they hide out in the bookshop, the always singing soprano boy working at the restaurant brings them food provided by Borst. Spica tortures the boy to find out where the bookshop is, and while Georgina is with the boy recovering in hospital, Spica's men torture Michael, force-feeding him pages from his books, choking and bleeding him to death, and Georgina discovers his body when she returns. In grief and rage she decides to exact her revenge on her husband in the only way she knows how, the gangster was heard shouting that he would kill and eat Michael when he found him, so she begs Borst to take Michael's body and to cook it, after a while of refusal he eventually agrees to this. The end sees Spica losing his restaurant business with financial downfall, and all the people he was horrible to him are gathered to watch his comeuppance, and Georgina brings out the cooked body of Michael and forces Spica at gunpoint to eat a mouthful of the body, forcing him to gag, and she shoots dead. Also starring Tim Roth as Mitchel, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Cory, Gary Olsen as Spangler, Ewan Stewart as Harris, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Turpin, Ron Cook as Mews, Liz Smith as Grace, Doctor Who's Alex Kingston as Adele, singer Ian Dury as Terry Fitch, Diane Langton as May Fitch and Roger Lloyd-Pack as Geoff. Gambon gives a brilliantly grotesque performance as the cruel and hateful criminal who only cares about himself, Mirren is really good clothed and unclothed as the long suffering wife who finds strength and true love, and the supporting cast all get their good moments as well, and the direction of Peter Greenaway is well paced and executed. This film obviously made an impact during the time of its release, especially for its controversial and thought provoking material, the use of nudity and graphic violence and dark sense of humour, the best scenes are definitely a sex scene at the same time as some chopping and food preparation and of course the hilariously gross ending, I would absolutely recommend this risqu&eacute; and marvellous black comedy drama. Dame Helen Mirren was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses, the film was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    I found this film to be highly entertaining. The colors, soundtrack and the cinematography were very interesting. Nothing really absurdly great, though. I mean, it is artsy in some level, but it is not "that" artsy. Though, it wasn't a masterpiece by any means: I saw 8 1/2 in the same day and it's mythical awesomeness contrasts with this highly awesome film still restricted to a mortal level of greatness. It is a good film, but not a great film. Its a dark comedy and it is sure to make people less "accustomed" to film than I am to be impressed/disgusted by some of the scenes.

    Those who are attracted to the latest wave of torture porn movies probably didn't know that the high-brows had a go at it way back in 1989. That truly is what this film represents. An "artistic" amalgam of adolescent bathroom humor and stomach turning violence and deep depravity. All served up in an in-your-face metaphor of feasting equals fornication. It is all garnished with baroque imagery, primary color saturation, and operatic pretensions. This is vile, vacuous, and venomous and is recommended for those with a strong constitution or for viewers who inhabit the boundaries and patrol the edge for "entertainment" and possibly those interested to see what the upper crust is up to.

    I see that quite a few people got quite a bit out of this. I see some of it. Some I see not at all. But what IS important here is that this film can generate such discussions, such thoughts, such artistry and philosophical posing(phrasing if you prefer). I will look at the film straight-on(as much as possible) as it is undoubtedly surreal. It is other-worldly. The story in simplistic terms is about a horrible, vile, odious thief named Albert who has a lovely wife named Georgina - who is not satisfied on many levels with her brutish, vulgar, common, loud, sadistic thief husband. This husband owns perhaps the most chic restaurant in town. It is a tapestry of beautiful colors with a mix of unreality generously garnishing it. I have seen very few films that rival this in its use of colors and lighting(Mario Bava's films come to mind as someone similar). Director Peter Greenaway(also the writer) does such a splendid job "painting" this film for indeed it looks visually like a moving painting or poem or some other aesthetic endeavour. Anyway, I digress, this thief and his wife are eating dinner when the eyes of Georgina meet with those of a timid, bookish man named Michael eating and reading at his table. Their eye meeting is sex(not unseen in this case) and explodes eventually into physical passion. The affair is eventually uncovered and Voilla! we get one of the grossest, bizarre, poetic(again that word) denouements in film history. This film is not big on plot and action but on emotion, passion, feeling, disgust, hate, love, sex, etc... Greenaway is the real star with both his urbane, witty, sadistic script and, more importantly, with his eye for aesthetics and innate beauty. He creates a very real film in a very unreal world. The restaurant is like no other in the world. Its parking lot is the same. Even the meat trucks are done in the most grand guignol fashion and have more in common with a scene from Sweeney Todd then anything about meat. The kitchen is huge with one man shirtless, a small boy singing what sound like melodious fugues, and there is Richard the French cook who gets his crowning moment in the final act of the film. The music by Michael Nyman is almost as important as the director's artistic lens. It pervades and moves each scene. And finally, though not unimportant in any way, is the acting of Michael Gambon as Albert, Helen Mirren as Georgina, Richard Bohringer as Richard and Alan Howard as Michael. All shine in their roles but Mirren and Gambon are moving. Mirren, the woman who won an Oscar playing Elizabeth II, is just the sexiest thing on screen in her lingerie, or eating her asparagus, or caressing her lover. She, like the camera lens, the music, moves symphonically. Gambon, however; is the real acting star. He is the pillar of disgust. He is putrid. He is wonderful in his role. I would even go so far to say he is delicious(but let's leave that for Alan Howard shall we). I guess I am gushing. This film deserves it. I do not often sit down to watch something and just become entranced with it. I knew when I finished this film that I had witnessed not just a film nor a great film but art. The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover is just that. Make no mistake.

    Spoilers: movie's narrative given in parts, action discerned. Why did Greenaway become Dutch, that reasonably hard and eclectic of nations? Greenaway loathes the English male. Michael the Bibliophile is as soft a 'man' as you'll find. Spica, a successful gangster is vile as his antithesis. Yet the interplay of two Englishmen is not sufficient to save the male in general. Borst, a French restaurateur creates value artistically with superb cuisine and decor. Unfortunately, as a man Borst is unable to save his restaurant from Spica's criminality and worse, Spica's anosognosic attempts to become a gastronome. The English male either despoils or when he does not he is as limp as the asparagus Michael feeds to Georgina. Both Spica and Michael feel they are superior, the former by possessing power and ownership, the latter arcane knowledge. Not enough to save either. As for the wonderful boy soprano, who has angelic purity of voice, even that is not enough to stave off Spica. Greenaway's middle period films finds males popping off the Loakes in rapid order. And like the middle period films Nyman's music contributes greatly. The important question is not to simply mention Hals' Banquet of the Officers as a reference to the Netherlands Glorietijd. It is to draw parallel the world of Spica, sitting underneath the officers as one who through misdeed and ruthlessness made his money. With it Spica has become whatever he wanted to be. He bought a slice of society and its values, yet this very gauche road to power is a process through which he undermines his acquisition, a robber baron capitalist par excellence. As the relationship between capitalism and oil painting has moved from Marxist critique (Berger) to mainstream thinking so does Spica move from the red room of capitalism to the engine rooms of kitchen with Indian (colonial) cooks, where Georgina and Michael find love and pleasure in prep rooms, storage rooms of differing colours and significance. Fragile qualities hide from driving, controlling capitalists with Spica's linear intrusion into these areas. Love and meaning, the pleasure of sensuality is found in each other as in the food Borst specially prepares for them. While monied art sought permanency in oils art as a live expression like Georgina's relationship with Michael is fleeting. When (gangster) capitalism no longer harnesses but believes it is responsible for output a train wreck ensues. The foreshadowing of Spica's demise is the chap in the opening sequence who "doesn't understand finer things." Eventually the creative (Borst), the oppressed (Georgina) and the factors of production (staff), rebel.

    My favourite film of all time. Sure, feel free to take that statement with a considerable pinch of salt; anybody who takes even the most cursory of glances at my page will know that I'm not exactly the world's biggest fan of films as a whole. Yet I, and those who look further into my ratings, know that I've simply been exposed to the wrong things over and over again (I have, for instance, rated no less than 12 Adam Sandler films, and a mighty and embarrassing 17 Jack Black films). The upshot of that is the reaction I have when I'm exposed to something that's not complete garbage - it's like a epiphany. With The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover, that reaction was stronger than with any other film I've seen. If I had to pinpoint the reason that this film blew apart my conceptions of how good a film could actually be, I'd point to the attention to detail paid to every individual aspect of the experience. In terms of production, this is like a populist Koyaanisqatsi - a genuine expert handles each field in collaboration with each other, with Michael Nyman offering a fantastic score, and Jean-Paul Gaultier designing the costumes, leaving Peter Greenaway to focus on the rest of the visuals. Even the food is designed by celebrity chef Giorgio Locatelli. The fact that these three collaborators are all allowed to leave genuine traces of their own personalities makes the entire film so much richer, so much more alive. But maybe it's simpler than that; maybe it's the feel of the plot that had me so absorbed from the off. There's real humour here, but it's so dark, so sarcastic, and so morbid that it almost slides under the radar. It feels very British to me, and it reminds me specifically of Chris Morris - there's a dichotomy about the humour, a push-and-pull between the need to make a point, and the childish desire to poke people with a stick just to see how they react. This is a film that pushes buttons, obvious buttons even, but it does so in a way that's definitely funny if you can get yourself into the right mindset (or if you just have a dumb, twisted sense of humour, which is an accusation I'm happy to field). Also, boobs. Whatever it is, this is a vivid, colourful (literally as well as figuratively), amusing, intelligent, fascinating, disturbing, fully realized, perfectly paced, utterly fantastic film. My quest since seeing it has been to find another film as good. So far, I haven't succeeded.

    I must confess that the only reason I watched this film was because it starred Helen Mirren who I knew took her clothes of in it. Sad maybe but there you are! Apart from this I didn't really know what else to expect as I knew nothing of the storyline. However, from the start I was quite taken aback by the sheer unpleasantness of it all. I know that it is supposed to have many meanings but all I remember is Michael Gambon's character being pretty awful to everyone and some poor book seller ending up on the dinner table. Even the nude scenes where a disappointment as the lighting appeared rather dim and fuzzy. Apart from Helen who oozes sex and sophistication I liked nothing else about this film. Repulsive rubbish!!

    The cruel and sadistic crime boss Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) has dinner every night in his restaurant with his wife Georgina Spica (Helen Mirren) and his gang. Albert abuses of his wife, his gangsters, the chef Richard Borst (Richard Bohringer) and the restaurant employees. When Georgina meets the gentle bookseller Michael (Alan Howard) in the restaurant, they have a torrid affair in the restroom and in the store, and they are covered by Richard. However the prostitute Pat discloses to Albert that he has been betrayed by Georgina and Albert kills Michael. However Georgina plots revenge against Albert with the support of Richard and the victims of Albert. "The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover" is one of the most grotesque, eschatological, bizarre and weird films that I have ever seen. But it is also absolutely original and mesmerizing, with intense use of colors, and with the contrast of vulgarity and art. Food, eschatology, sex, cruelty, torture, cannibalism and revenge are entwined along 124 minutes running time. The result is not pleasant and only specific audiences will appreciate this film. Last time I had seen this film was on 08 September 2000 on VHS. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Cozinheiro, o Ladr&atilde;o, Sua Mulher e o Amante" ("The Cook the Thief, His Wife and the Lover")

But what IS important here is that this film can generate such discussions, such thoughts, such artistry and philosophical posing(phrasing if you prefer). I will look at the film straight-on(as much as possible) as it is undoubtedly surreal. It is other-worldly. The story in simplistic terms is about a horrible, vile, odious thief named Albert who has a lovely wife named Georgina - who is not satisfied on many levels with her brutish, vulgar, common, loud, sadistic thief husband. This husband owns perhaps the most chic restaurant in town. It is a tapestry of beautiful colors with a mix of unreality generously garnishing it. I have seen very few films that rival this in its use of colors and lighting(Mario Bava's films come to mind as someone similar). Director Peter Greenaway(also the writer) does such a splendid job "painting" this film for indeed it looks visually like a moving painting or poem or some other aesthetic endeavour. Anyway, I digress, this thief and his wife are eating dinner when the eyes of Georgina meet with those of a timid, bookish man named Michael eating and reading at his table. Their eye meeting is sex(not unseen in this case) and explodes eventually into physical passion. The affair is eventually uncovered and Voilla! we get one of the grossest, bizarre, poetic(again that word) denouements in film history. This film is not big on plot and action but on emotion, passion, feeling, disgust, hate, love, sex, etc... Greenaway is the real star with both his urbane, witty, sadistic script and, more importantly, with his eye for aesthetics and innate beauty. He creates a very real film in a very unreal world. The restaurant is like no other in the world. Its parking lot is the same. Even the meat trucks are done in the most grand guignol fashion and have more in common with a scene from Sweeney Todd then anything about meat. The kitchen is huge with one man shirtless, a small boy singing what sound like melodious fugues, and there is Richard the French cook who gets his crowning moment in the final act of the film. The music by Michael Nyman is almost as important as the director's artistic lens. It pervades and moves each scene. And finally, though not unimportant in any way, is the acting of Michael Gambon as Albert, Helen Mirren as Georgina, Richard Bohringer as Richard and Alan Howard as Michael. All shine in their roles but Mirren and Gambon are moving. Mirren, the woman who won an Oscar playing Elizabeth II, is just the sexiest thing on screen in her lingerie, or eating her asparagus, or caressing her lover. She, like the camera lens, the music, moves symphonically. Gambon, however; is the real acting star. He is the pillar of disgust. He is putrid. He is wonderful in his role. I would even go so far to say he is delicious(but let's leave that for Alan Howard shall we). I guess I am gushing. This film deserves it. I do not often sit down to watch something and just become entranced with it. I knew when I finished this film that I had witnessed not just a film nor a great film but art. The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover is just that. Make no mistake.

    Spoilers: movie's narrative given in parts, action discerned. Why did Greenaway become Dutch, that reasonably hard and eclectic of nations? Greenaway loathes the English male. Michael the Bibliophile is as soft a 'man' as you'll find. Spica, a successful gangster is vile as his antithesis. Yet the interplay of two Englishmen is not sufficient to save the male in general. Borst, a French restaurateur creates value artistically with superb cuisine and decor. Unfortunately, as a man Borst is unable to save his restaurant from Spica's criminality and worse, Spica's anosognosic attempts to become a gastronome. The English male either despoils or when he does not he is as limp as the asparagus Michael feeds to Georgina. Both Spica and Michael feel they are superior, the former by possessing power and ownership, the latter arcane knowledge. Not enough to save either. As for the wonderful boy soprano, who has angelic purity of voice, even that is not enough to stave off Spica. Greenaway's middle period films finds males popping off the Loakes in rapid order. And like the middle period films Nyman's music contributes greatly. The important question is not to simply mention Hals' Banquet of the Officers as a reference to the Netherlands Glorietijd. It is to draw parallel the world of Spica, sitting underneath the officers as one who through misdeed and ruthlessness made his money. With it Spica has become whatever he wanted to be. He bought a slice of society and its values, yet this very gauche road to power is a process through which he undermines his acquisition, a robber baron capitalist par excellence. As the relationship between capitalism and oil painting has moved from Marxist critique (Berger) to mainstream thinking so does Spica move from the red room of capitalism to the engine rooms of kitchen with Indian (colonial) cooks, where Georgina and Michael find love and pleasure in prep rooms, storage rooms of differing colours and significance. Fragile qualities hide from driving, controlling capitalists with Spica's linear intrusion into these areas. Love and meaning, the pleasure of sensuality is found in each other as in the food Borst specially prepares for them. While monied art sought permanency in oils art as a live expression like Georgina's relationship with Michael is fleeting. When (gangster) capitalism no longer harnesses but believes it is responsible for output a train wreck ensues. The foreshadowing of Spica's demise is the chap in the opening sequence who "doesn't understand finer things." Eventually the creative (Borst), the oppressed (Georgina) and the factors of production (staff), rebel.

    My favourite film of all time. Sure, feel free to take that statement with a considerable pinch of salt; anybody who takes even the most cursory of glances at my page will know that I'm not exactly the world's biggest fan of films as a whole. Yet I, and those who look further into my ratings, know that I've simply been exposed to the wrong things over and over again (I have, for instance, rated no less than 12 Adam Sandler films, and a mighty and embarrassing 17 Jack Black films). The upshot of that is the reaction I have when I'm exposed to something that's not complete garbage - it's like a epiphany. With The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover, that reaction was stronger than with any other film I've seen. If I had to pinpoint the reason that this film blew apart my conceptions of how good a film could actually be, I'd point to the attention to detail paid to every individual aspect of the experience. In terms of production, this is like a populist Koyaanisqatsi - a genuine expert handles each field in collaboration with each other, with Michael Nyman offering a fantastic score, and Jean-Paul Gaultier designing the costumes, leaving Peter Greenaway to focus on the rest of the visuals. Even the food is designed by celebrity chef Giorgio Locatelli. The fact that these three collaborators are all allowed to leave genuine traces of their own personalities makes the entire film so much richer, so much more alive. But maybe it's simpler than that; maybe it's the feel of the plot that had me so absorbed from the off. There's real humour here, but it's so dark, so sarcastic, and so morbid that it almost slides under the radar. It feels very British to me, and it reminds me specifically of Chris Morris - there's a dichotomy about the humour, a push-and-pull between the need to make a point, and the childish desire to poke people with a stick just to see how they react. This is a film that pushes buttons, obvious buttons even, but it does so in a way that's definitely funny if you can get yourself into the right mindset (or if you just have a dumb, twisted sense of humour, which is an accusation I'm happy to field). Also, boobs. Whatever it is, this is a vivid, colourful (literally as well as figuratively), amusing, intelligent, fascinating, disturbing, fully realized, perfectly paced, utterly fantastic film. My quest since seeing it has been to find another film as good. So far, I haven't succeeded.

    I must confess that the only reason I watched this film was because it starred Helen Mirren who I knew took her clothes of in it. Sad maybe but there you are! Apart from this I didn't really know what else to expect as I knew nothing of the storyline. However, from the start I was quite taken aback by the sheer unpleasantness of it all. I know that it is supposed to have many meanings but all I remember is Michael Gambon's character being pretty awful to everyone and some poor book seller ending up on the dinner table. Even the nude scenes where a disappointment as the lighting appeared rather dim and fuzzy. Apart from Helen who oozes sex and sophistication I liked nothing else about this film. Repulsive rubbish!!

    The cruel and sadistic crime boss Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) has dinner every night in his restaurant with his wife Georgina Spica (Helen Mirren) and his gang. Albert abuses of his wife, his gangsters, the chef Richard Borst (Richard Bohringer) and the restaurant employees. When Georgina meets the gentle bookseller Michael (Alan Howard) in the restaurant, they have a torrid affair in the restroom and in the store, and they are covered by Richard. However the prostitute Pat discloses to Albert that he has been betrayed by Georgina and Albert kills Michael. However Georgina plots revenge against Albert with the support of Richard and the victims of Albert. "The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover" is one of the most grotesque, eschatological, bizarre and weird films that I have ever seen. But it is also absolutely original and mesmerizing, with intense use of colors, and with the contrast of vulgarity and art. Food, eschatology, sex, cruelty, torture, cannibalism and revenge are entwined along 124 minutes running time. The result is not pleasant and only specific audiences will appreciate this film. Last time I had seen this film was on 08 September 2000 on VHS. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Cozinheiro, o Ladr&atilde;o, Sua Mulher e o Amante" ("The Cook the Thief, His Wife and the Lover")

    I have a problem with art-house films like THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER and it's that the directors of such fare are often totally ignorant when it comes to decent film-making. Sure, they obsess over designer costumes and make-up, and they focus intently on the colour palette of their movies, but when it comes to movie-making staples like pace, character, dialogue, and intrigue, they fail. Peter Greenaway is such a director. This controversial 1989 opus is known for its gruesome scenes of cannibalism, yet take away the controversy and there's absolutely nothing here to rate this. The running time is as slow as a snail, and much of it is made up of scenes of the repulsive Michael Gambon character berating his wife and associates. Greenaway's a better director than he is a writer, because the script is terrible. We get the gist of Gambon's character and the situation with his wife in the first ten minutes, yet two hours of non-action go by in which we're bludgeoned over the head with his sheer monotonous brutish nature. The whole film takes place on a cheap-looking set that quickly becomes boring, Helen Mirren spends most of the running time naked and forgets how to act, and luminaries such as Tim Roth and Ciaran Hinds are wasted. Yes, there are a few shocking scenes, yet cannibalism is dealt with in a much more entertaining fashion in both B-movie fare (such as Pete Walker's 1974 FRIGHTMARE) and Hollywood flicks (like RAVENOUS). I'm not against arty films where nothing happens, but there has to be substance to go with the style; Nic Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW is a case in point: one of my favourite films of all time, but hardly action-packed. THE COOK... just wastes a great deal of potential and proves to be another case of The Emperor's New Clothes.

    I love the visual style of this film; it's very theatrical but with huge backdrops; some of the scenes in the restaurant almost look like they're filmed in an aircraft hanger. The use of colour is quite brilliant, even down to the actor's costume changing colour as they move from room to room. I thought the music fitted the piece quite brilliantly too (aside from the operatic stuff  those that have seen it will know what I'm referring to). All the performances were excellent; in particular Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon; they both really shone in this one! It's certainly one I'll be seeing again sometime and one I heartily recommend although some may find certain scenes distasteful (definitely not for the youngsters!). SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.9/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    I heard about this film because of its sexual content and a few of the actors starring before finding out it one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die in the book of the same name, so that made me even more keen to see it. Basically high-class Le Hollandais Restaurant, run by French chef Richard Borst, the Cook (Richard Bohringer) has been taken over by vicious, malevolent and sadistic English gangster Albert Spica, the Thief (Sir Michael Gambon), and he makes numerous nightly appearances at the restaurant as host to dining parties of fellow thugs. With no interest and respect for the feelings and integrity of his staff and customers Spica's despicable behaviour causes many confrontations and he loses some of their company, but he gets away with taking their money. The one who suffers the most from his intolerable attitude is his finely bred and beautiful spouse Georgina Spica, the Wife (Dame Helen Mirren) who is forced into joining in his activities, and she often is victim to his abusive comments and occasional disrespectful actions. She has obviously had enough, and she soon enough catches the eye of and starts a passionate affair with bookshop owner and regular restaurant customer Michael, the Lover (Alan Howard), and with the help of the staff she manages to continue it right under her husband's nose. Eventually Spica does find out about the affair, and despite having no clothes Georgina and Michael escape from his raging tirade in the back of a truck containing rotting meat and vegetables, and they hide out in the bookshop, the always singing soprano boy working at the restaurant brings them food provided by Borst. Spica tortures the boy to find out where the bookshop is, and while Georgina is with the boy recovering in hospital, Spica's men torture Michael, force-feeding him pages from his books, choking and bleeding him to death, and Georgina discovers his body when she returns. In grief and rage she decides to exact her revenge on her husband in the only way she knows how, the gangster was heard shouting that he would kill and eat Michael when he found him, so she begs Borst to take Michael's body and to cook it, after a while of refusal he eventually agrees to this. The end sees Spica losing his restaurant business with financial downfall, and all the people he was horrible to him are gathered to watch his comeuppance, and Georgina brings out the cooked body of Michael and forces Spica at gunpoint to eat a mouthful of the body, forcing him to gag, and she shoots dead. Also starring Tim Roth as Mitchel, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Cory, Gary Olsen as Spangler, Ewan Stewart as Harris, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Turpin, Ron Cook as Mews, Liz Smith as Grace, Doctor Who's Alex Kingston as Adele, singer Ian Dury as Terry Fitch, Diane Langton as May Fitch and Roger Lloyd-Pack as Geoff. Gambon gives a brilliantly grotesque performance as the cruel and hateful criminal who only cares about himself, Mirren is really good clothed and unclothed as the long suffering wife who finds strength and true love, and the supporting cast all get their good moments as well, and the direction of Peter Greenaway is well paced and executed. This film obviously made an impact during the time of its release, especially for its controversial and thought provoking material, the use of nudity and graphic violence and dark sense of humour, the best scenes are definitely a sex scene at the same time as some chopping and food preparation and of course the hilariously gross ending, I would absolutely recommend this risqu&eacute; and marvellous black comedy drama. Dame Helen Mirren was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses, the film was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    I found this film to be highly entertaining. The colors, soundtrack and the cinematography were very interesting. Nothing really absurdly great, though. I mean, it is artsy in some level, but it is not "that" artsy. Though, it wasn't a masterpiece by any means: I saw 8 1/2 in the same day and it's mythical awesomeness contrasts with this highly awesome film still restricted to a mortal level of greatness. It is a good film, but not a great film. Its a dark comedy and it is sure to make people less "accustomed" to film than I am to be impressed/disgusted by some of the scenes.

    Those who are attracted to the latest wave of torture porn movies probably didn't know that the high-brows had a go at it way back in 1989. That truly is what this film represents. An "artistic" amalgam of adolescent bathroom humor and stomach turning violence and deep depravity. All served up in an in-your-face metaphor of feasting equals fornication. It is all garnished with baroque imagery, primary color saturation, and operatic pretensions. This is vile, vacuous, and venomous and is recommended for those with a strong constitution or for viewers who inhabit the boundaries and patrol the edge for "entertainment" and possibly those interested to see what the upper crust is up to.

    I have a problem with art-house films like THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER and it's that the directors of such fare are often totally ignorant when it comes to decent film-making. Sure, they obsess over designer costumes and make-up, and they focus intently on the colour palette of their movies, but when it comes to movie-making staples like pace, character, dialogue, and intrigue, they fail. Peter Greenaway is such a director. This controversial 1989 opus is known for its gruesome scenes of cannibalism, yet take away the controversy and there's absolutely nothing here to rate this. The running time is as slow as a snail, and much of it is made up of scenes of the repulsive Michael Gambon character berating his wife and associates. Greenaway's a better director than he is a writer, because the script is terrible. We get the gist of Gambon's character and the situation with his wife in the first ten minutes, yet two hours of non-action go by in which we're bludgeoned over the head with his sheer monotonous brutish nature. The whole film takes place on a cheap-looking set that quickly becomes boring, Helen Mirren spends most of the running time naked and forgets how to act, and luminaries such as Tim Roth and Ciaran Hinds are wasted. Yes, there are a few shocking scenes, yet cannibalism is dealt with in a much more entertaining fashion in both B-movie fare (such as Pete Walker's 1974 FRIGHTMARE) and Hollywood flicks (like RAVENOUS). I'm not against arty films where nothing happens, but there has to be substance to go with the style; Nic Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW is a case in point: one of my favourite films of all time, but hardly action-packed. THE COOK... just wastes a great deal of potential and proves to be another case of The Emperor's New Clothes.

    I love the visual style of this film; it's very theatrical but with huge backdrops; some of the scenes in the restaurant almost look like they're filmed in an aircraft hanger. The use of colour is quite brilliant, even down to the actor's costume changing colour as they move from room to room. I thought the music fitted the piece quite brilliantly too (aside from the operatic stuff  those that have seen it will know what I'm referring to). All the performances were excellent; in particular Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon; they both really shone in this one! It's certainly one I'll be seeing again sometime and one I heartily recommend although some may find certain scenes distasteful (definitely not for the youngsters!). SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.9/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    I heard about this film because of its sexual content and a few of the actors starring before finding out it one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die in the book of the same name, so that made me even more keen to see it. Basically high-class Le Hollandais Restaurant, run by French chef Richard Borst, the Cook (Richard Bohringer) has been taken over by vicious, malevolent and sadistic English gangster Albert Spica, the Thief (Sir Michael Gambon), and he makes numerous nightly appearances at the restaurant as host to dining parties of fellow thugs. With no interest and respect for the feelings and integrity of his staff and customers Spica's despicable behaviour causes many confrontations and he loses some of their company, but he gets away with taking their money. The one who suffers the most from his intolerable attitude is his finely bred and beautiful spouse Georgina Spica, the Wife (Dame Helen Mirren) who is forced into joining in his activities, and she often is victim to his abusive comments and occasional disrespectful actions. She has obviously had enough, and she soon enough catches the eye of and starts a passionate affair with bookshop owner and regular restaurant customer Michael, the Lover (Alan Howard), and with the help of the staff she manages to continue it right under her husband's nose. Eventually Spica does find out about the affair, and despite having no clothes Georgina and Michael escape from his raging tirade in the back of a truck containing rotting meat and vegetables, and they hide out in the bookshop, the always singing soprano boy working at the restaurant brings them food provided by Borst. Spica tortures the boy to find out where the bookshop is, and while Georgina is with the boy recovering in hospital, Spica's men torture Michael, force-feeding him pages from his books, choking and bleeding him to death, and Georgina discovers his body when she returns. In grief and rage she decides to exact her revenge on her husband in the only way she knows how, the gangster was heard shouting that he would kill and eat Michael when he found him, so she begs Borst to take Michael's body and to cook it, after a while of refusal he eventually agrees to this. The end sees Spica losing his restaurant business with financial downfall, and all the people he was horrible to him are gathered to watch his comeuppance, and Georgina brings out the cooked body of Michael and forces Spica at gunpoint to eat a mouthful of the body, forcing him to gag, and she shoots dead. Also starring Tim Roth as Mitchel, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Cory, Gary Olsen as Spangler, Ewan Stewart as Harris, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Turpin, Ron Cook as Mews, Liz Smith as Grace, Doctor Who's Alex Kingston as Adele, singer Ian Dury as Terry Fitch, Diane Langton as May Fitch and Roger Lloyd-Pack as Geoff. Gambon gives a brilliantly grotesque performance as the cruel and hateful criminal who only cares about himself, Mirren is really good clothed and unclothed as the long suffering wife who finds strength and true love, and the supporting cast all get their good moments as well, and the direction of Peter Greenaway is well paced and executed. This film obviously made an impact during the time of its release, especially for its controversial and thought provoking material, the use of nudity and graphic violence and dark sense of humour, the best scenes are definitely a sex scene at the same time as some chopping and food preparation and of course the hilariously gross ending, I would absolutely recommend this risqu&eacute; and marvellous black comedy drama. Dame Helen Mirren was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses, the film was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    I found this film to be highly entertaining. The colors, soundtrack and the cinematography were very interesting. Nothing really absurdly great, though. I mean, it is artsy in some level, but it is not "that" artsy. Though, it wasn't a masterpiece by any means: I saw 8 1/2 in the same day and it's mythical awesomeness contrasts with this highly awesome film still restricted to a mortal level of greatness. It is a good film, but not a great film. Its a dark comedy and it is sure to make people less "accustomed" to film than I am to be impressed/disgusted by some of the scenes.

    Those who are attracted to the latest wave of torture porn movies probably didn't know that the high-brows had a go at it way back in 1989. That truly is what this film represents. An "artistic" amalgam of adolescent bathroom humor and stomach turning violence and deep depravity. All served up in an in-your-face metaphor of feasting equals fornication. It is all garnished with baroque imagery, primary color saturation, and operatic pretensions. This is vile, vacuous, and venomous and is recommended for those with a strong constitution or for viewers who inhabit the boundaries and patrol the edge for "entertainment" and possibly those interested to see what the upper crust is up to.

    I see that quite a few people got quite a bit out of this. I see some of it. Some I see not at all. But what IS important here is that this film can generate such discussions, such thoughts, such artistry and philosophical posing(phrasing if you prefer). I will look at the film straight-on(as much as possible) as it is undoubtedly surreal. It is other-worldly. The story in simplistic terms is about a horrible, vile, odious thief named Albert who has a lovely wife named Georgina - who is not satisfied on many levels with her brutish, vulgar, common, loud, sadistic thief husband. This husband owns perhaps the most chic restaurant in town. It is a tapestry of beautiful colors with a mix of unreality generously garnishing it. I have seen very few films that rival this in its use of colors and lighting(Mario Bava's films come to mind as someone similar). Director Peter Greenaway(also the writer) does such a splendid job "painting" this film for indeed it looks visually like a moving painting or poem or some other aesthetic endeavour. Anyway, I digress, this thief and his wife are eating dinner when the eyes of Georgina meet with those of a timid, bookish man named Michael eating and reading at his table. Their eye meeting is sex(not unseen in this case) and explodes eventually into physical passion. The affair is eventually uncovered and Voilla! we get one of the grossest, bizarre, poetic(again that word) denouements in film history. This film is not big on plot and action but on emotion, passion, feeling, disgust, hate, love, sex, etc... Greenaway is the real star with both his urbane, witty, sadistic script and, more importantly, with his eye for aesthetics and innate beauty. He creates a very real film in a very unreal world. The restaurant is like no other in the world. Its parking lot is the same. Even the meat trucks are done in the most grand guignol fashion and have more in common with a scene from Sweeney Todd then anything about meat. The kitchen is huge with one man shirtless, a small boy singing what sound like melodious fugues, and there is Richard the French cook who gets his crowning moment in the final act of the film. The music by Michael Nyman is almost as important as the director's artistic lens. It pervades and moves each scene. And finally, though not unimportant in any way, is the acting of Michael Gambon as Albert, Helen Mirren as Georgina, Richard Bohringer as Richard and Alan Howard as Michael. All shine in their roles but Mirren and Gambon are moving. Mirren, the woman who won an Oscar playing Elizabeth II, is just the sexiest thing on screen in her lingerie, or eating her asparagus, or caressing her lover. She, like the camera lens, the music, moves symphonically. Gambon, however; is the real acting star. He is the pillar of disgust. He is putrid. He is wonderful in his role. I would even go so far to say he is delicious(but let's leave that for Alan Howard shall we). I guess I am gushing. This film deserves it. I do not often sit down to watch something and just become entranced with it. I knew when I finished this film that I had witnessed not just a film nor a great film but art. The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover is just that. Make no mistake.

    Spoilers: movie's narrative given in parts, action discerned. Why did Greenaway become Dutch, that reasonably hard and eclectic of nations? Greenaway loathes the English male. Michael the Bibliophile is as soft a 'man' as you'll find. Spica, a successful gangster is vile as his antithesis. Yet the interplay of two Englishmen is not sufficient to save the male in general. Borst, a French restaurateur creates value artistically with superb cuisine and decor. Unfortunately, as a man Borst is unable to save his restaurant from Spica's criminality and worse, Spica's anosognosic attempts to become a gastronome. The English male either despoils or when he does not he is as limp as the asparagus Michael feeds to Georgina. Both Spica and Michael feel they are superior, the former by possessing power and ownership, the latter arcane knowledge. Not enough to save either. As for the wonderful boy soprano, who has angelic purity of voice, even that is not enough to stave off Spica. Greenaway's middle period films finds males popping off the Loakes in rapid order. And like the middle period films Nyman's music contributes greatly. The important question is not to simply mention Hals' Banquet of the Officers as a reference to the Netherlands Glorietijd. It is to draw parallel the world of Spica, sitting underneath the officers as one who through misdeed and ruthlessness made his money. With it Spica has become whatever he wanted to be. He bought a slice of society and its values, yet this very gauche road to power is a process through which he undermines his acquisition, a robber baron capitalist par excellence. As the relationship between capitalism and oil painting has moved from Marxist critique (Berger) to mainstream thinking so does Spica move from the red room of capitalism to the engine rooms of kitchen with Indian (colonial) cooks, where Georgina and Michael find love and pleasure in prep rooms, storage rooms of differing colours and significance. Fragile qualities hide from driving, controlling capitalists with Spica's linear intrusion into these areas. Love and meaning, the pleasure of sensuality is found in each other as in the food Borst specially prepares for them. While monied art sought permanency in oils art as a live expression like Georgina's relationship with Michael is fleeting. When (gangster) capitalism no longer harnesses but believes it is responsible for output a train wreck ensues. The foreshadowing of Spica's demise is the chap in the opening sequence who "doesn't understand finer things." Eventually the creative (Borst), the oppressed (Georgina) and the factors of production (staff), rebel.

    My favourite film of all time. Sure, feel free to take that statement with a considerable pinch of salt; anybody who takes even the most cursory of glances at my page will know that I'm not exactly the world's biggest fan of films as a whole. Yet I, and those who look further into my ratings, know that I've simply been exposed to the wrong things over and over again (I have, for instance, rated no less than 12 Adam Sandler films, and a mighty and embarrassing 17 Jack Black films). The upshot of that is the reaction I have when I'm exposed to something that's not complete garbage - it's like a epiphany. With The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover, that reaction was stronger than with any other film I've seen. If I had to pinpoint the reason that this film blew apart my conceptions of how good a film could actually be, I'd point to the attention to detail paid to every individual aspect of the experience. In terms of production, this is like a populist Koyaanisqatsi - a genuine expert handles each field in collaboration with each other, with Michael Nyman offering a fantastic score, and Jean-Paul Gaultier designing the costumes, leaving Peter Greenaway to focus on the rest of the visuals. Even the food is designed by celebrity chef Giorgio Locatelli. The fact that these three collaborators are all allowed to leave genuine traces of their own personalities makes the entire film so much richer, so much more alive. But maybe it's simpler than that; maybe it's the feel of the plot that had me so absorbed from the off. There's real humour here, but it's so dark, so sarcastic, and so morbid that it almost slides under the radar. It feels very British to me, and it reminds me specifically of Chris Morris - there's a dichotomy about the humour, a push-and-pull between the need to make a point, and the childish desire to poke people with a stick just to see how they react. This is a film that pushes buttons, obvious buttons even, but it does so in a way that's definitely funny if you can get yourself into the right mindset (or if you just have a dumb, twisted sense of humour, which is an accusation I'm happy to field). Also, boobs. Whatever it is, this is a vivid, colourful (literally as well as figuratively), amusing, intelligent, fascinating, disturbing, fully realized, perfectly paced, utterly fantastic film. My quest since seeing it has been to find another film as good. So far, I haven't succeeded.

    I must confess that the only reason I watched this film was because it starred Helen Mirren who I knew took her clothes of in it. Sad maybe but there you are! Apart from this I didn't really know what else to expect as I knew nothing of the storyline. However, from the start I was quite taken aback by the sheer unpleasantness of it all. I know that it is supposed to have many meanings but all I remember is Michael Gambon's character being pretty awful to everyone and some poor book seller ending up on the dinner table. Even the nude scenes where a disappointment as the lighting appeared rather dim and fuzzy. Apart from Helen who oozes sex and sophistication I liked nothing else about this film. Repulsive rubbish!!

    The cruel and sadistic crime boss Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) has dinner every night in his restaurant with his wife Georgina Spica (Helen Mirren) and his gang. Albert abuses of his wife, his gangsters, the chef Richard Borst (Richard Bohringer) and the restaurant employees. When Georgina meets the gentle bookseller Michael (Alan Howard) in the restaurant, they have a torrid affair in the restroom and in the store, and they are covered by Richard. However the prostitute Pat discloses to Albert that he has been betrayed by Georgina and Albert kills Michael. However Georgina plots revenge against Albert with the support of Richard and the victims of Albert. "The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover" is one of the most grotesque, eschatological, bizarre and weird films that I have ever seen. But it is also absolutely original and mesmerizing, with intense use of colors, and with the contrast of vulgarity and art. Food, eschatology, sex, cruelty, torture, cannibalism and revenge are entwined along 124 minutes running time. The result is not pleasant and only specific audiences will appreciate this film. Last time I had seen this film was on 08 September 2000 on VHS. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Cozinheiro, o Ladr&atilde;o, Sua Mulher e o Amante" ("The Cook the Thief, His Wife and the Lover")

She, like the camera lens, the music, moves symphonically. Gambon, however; is the real acting star. He is the pillar of disgust. He is putrid. He is wonderful in his role. I would even go so far to say he is delicious(but let's leave that for Alan Howard shall we). I guess I am gushing. This film deserves it. I do not often sit down to watch something and just become entranced with it. I knew when I finished this film that I had witnessed not just a film nor a great film but art. The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover is just that. Make no mistake.

    Spoilers: movie's narrative given in parts, action discerned. Why did Greenaway become Dutch, that reasonably hard and eclectic of nations? Greenaway loathes the English male. Michael the Bibliophile is as soft a 'man' as you'll find. Spica, a successful gangster is vile as his antithesis. Yet the interplay of two Englishmen is not sufficient to save the male in general. Borst, a French restaurateur creates value artistically with superb cuisine and decor. Unfortunately, as a man Borst is unable to save his restaurant from Spica's criminality and worse, Spica's anosognosic attempts to become a gastronome. The English male either despoils or when he does not he is as limp as the asparagus Michael feeds to Georgina. Both Spica and Michael feel they are superior, the former by possessing power and ownership, the latter arcane knowledge. Not enough to save either. As for the wonderful boy soprano, who has angelic purity of voice, even that is not enough to stave off Spica. Greenaway's middle period films finds males popping off the Loakes in rapid order. And like the middle period films Nyman's music contributes greatly. The important question is not to simply mention Hals' Banquet of the Officers as a reference to the Netherlands Glorietijd. It is to draw parallel the world of Spica, sitting underneath the officers as one who through misdeed and ruthlessness made his money. With it Spica has become whatever he wanted to be. He bought a slice of society and its values, yet this very gauche road to power is a process through which he undermines his acquisition, a robber baron capitalist par excellence. As the relationship between capitalism and oil painting has moved from Marxist critique (Berger) to mainstream thinking so does Spica move from the red room of capitalism to the engine rooms of kitchen with Indian (colonial) cooks, where Georgina and Michael find love and pleasure in prep rooms, storage rooms of differing colours and significance. Fragile qualities hide from driving, controlling capitalists with Spica's linear intrusion into these areas. Love and meaning, the pleasure of sensuality is found in each other as in the food Borst specially prepares for them. While monied art sought permanency in oils art as a live expression like Georgina's relationship with Michael is fleeting. When (gangster) capitalism no longer harnesses but believes it is responsible for output a train wreck ensues. The foreshadowing of Spica's demise is the chap in the opening sequence who "doesn't understand finer things." Eventually the creative (Borst), the oppressed (Georgina) and the factors of production (staff), rebel.

    My favourite film of all time. Sure, feel free to take that statement with a considerable pinch of salt; anybody who takes even the most cursory of glances at my page will know that I'm not exactly the world's biggest fan of films as a whole. Yet I, and those who look further into my ratings, know that I've simply been exposed to the wrong things over and over again (I have, for instance, rated no less than 12 Adam Sandler films, and a mighty and embarrassing 17 Jack Black films). The upshot of that is the reaction I have when I'm exposed to something that's not complete garbage - it's like a epiphany. With The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover, that reaction was stronger than with any other film I've seen. If I had to pinpoint the reason that this film blew apart my conceptions of how good a film could actually be, I'd point to the attention to detail paid to every individual aspect of the experience. In terms of production, this is like a populist Koyaanisqatsi - a genuine expert handles each field in collaboration with each other, with Michael Nyman offering a fantastic score, and Jean-Paul Gaultier designing the costumes, leaving Peter Greenaway to focus on the rest of the visuals. Even the food is designed by celebrity chef Giorgio Locatelli. The fact that these three collaborators are all allowed to leave genuine traces of their own personalities makes the entire film so much richer, so much more alive. But maybe it's simpler than that; maybe it's the feel of the plot that had me so absorbed from the off. There's real humour here, but it's so dark, so sarcastic, and so morbid that it almost slides under the radar. It feels very British to me, and it reminds me specifically of Chris Morris - there's a dichotomy about the humour, a push-and-pull between the need to make a point, and the childish desire to poke people with a stick just to see how they react. This is a film that pushes buttons, obvious buttons even, but it does so in a way that's definitely funny if you can get yourself into the right mindset (or if you just have a dumb, twisted sense of humour, which is an accusation I'm happy to field). Also, boobs. Whatever it is, this is a vivid, colourful (literally as well as figuratively), amusing, intelligent, fascinating, disturbing, fully realized, perfectly paced, utterly fantastic film. My quest since seeing it has been to find another film as good. So far, I haven't succeeded.

    I must confess that the only reason I watched this film was because it starred Helen Mirren who I knew took her clothes of in it. Sad maybe but there you are! Apart from this I didn't really know what else to expect as I knew nothing of the storyline. However, from the start I was quite taken aback by the sheer unpleasantness of it all. I know that it is supposed to have many meanings but all I remember is Michael Gambon's character being pretty awful to everyone and some poor book seller ending up on the dinner table. Even the nude scenes where a disappointment as the lighting appeared rather dim and fuzzy. Apart from Helen who oozes sex and sophistication I liked nothing else about this film. Repulsive rubbish!!

    The cruel and sadistic crime boss Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) has dinner every night in his restaurant with his wife Georgina Spica (Helen Mirren) and his gang. Albert abuses of his wife, his gangsters, the chef Richard Borst (Richard Bohringer) and the restaurant employees. When Georgina meets the gentle bookseller Michael (Alan Howard) in the restaurant, they have a torrid affair in the restroom and in the store, and they are covered by Richard. However the prostitute Pat discloses to Albert that he has been betrayed by Georgina and Albert kills Michael. However Georgina plots revenge against Albert with the support of Richard and the victims of Albert. "The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover" is one of the most grotesque, eschatological, bizarre and weird films that I have ever seen. But it is also absolutely original and mesmerizing, with intense use of colors, and with the contrast of vulgarity and art. Food, eschatology, sex, cruelty, torture, cannibalism and revenge are entwined along 124 minutes running time. The result is not pleasant and only specific audiences will appreciate this film. Last time I had seen this film was on 08 September 2000 on VHS. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Cozinheiro, o Ladr&atilde;o, Sua Mulher e o Amante" ("The Cook the Thief, His Wife and the Lover")

    I have a problem with art-house films like THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER and it's that the directors of such fare are often totally ignorant when it comes to decent film-making. Sure, they obsess over designer costumes and make-up, and they focus intently on the colour palette of their movies, but when it comes to movie-making staples like pace, character, dialogue, and intrigue, they fail. Peter Greenaway is such a director. This controversial 1989 opus is known for its gruesome scenes of cannibalism, yet take away the controversy and there's absolutely nothing here to rate this. The running time is as slow as a snail, and much of it is made up of scenes of the repulsive Michael Gambon character berating his wife and associates. Greenaway's a better director than he is a writer, because the script is terrible. We get the gist of Gambon's character and the situation with his wife in the first ten minutes, yet two hours of non-action go by in which we're bludgeoned over the head with his sheer monotonous brutish nature. The whole film takes place on a cheap-looking set that quickly becomes boring, Helen Mirren spends most of the running time naked and forgets how to act, and luminaries such as Tim Roth and Ciaran Hinds are wasted. Yes, there are a few shocking scenes, yet cannibalism is dealt with in a much more entertaining fashion in both B-movie fare (such as Pete Walker's 1974 FRIGHTMARE) and Hollywood flicks (like RAVENOUS). I'm not against arty films where nothing happens, but there has to be substance to go with the style; Nic Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW is a case in point: one of my favourite films of all time, but hardly action-packed. THE COOK... just wastes a great deal of potential and proves to be another case of The Emperor's New Clothes.

    I love the visual style of this film; it's very theatrical but with huge backdrops; some of the scenes in the restaurant almost look like they're filmed in an aircraft hanger. The use of colour is quite brilliant, even down to the actor's costume changing colour as they move from room to room. I thought the music fitted the piece quite brilliantly too (aside from the operatic stuff  those that have seen it will know what I'm referring to). All the performances were excellent; in particular Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon; they both really shone in this one! It's certainly one I'll be seeing again sometime and one I heartily recommend although some may find certain scenes distasteful (definitely not for the youngsters!). SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.9/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    I heard about this film because of its sexual content and a few of the actors starring before finding out it one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die in the book of the same name, so that made me even more keen to see it. Basically high-class Le Hollandais Restaurant, run by French chef Richard Borst, the Cook (Richard Bohringer) has been taken over by vicious, malevolent and sadistic English gangster Albert Spica, the Thief (Sir Michael Gambon), and he makes numerous nightly appearances at the restaurant as host to dining parties of fellow thugs. With no interest and respect for the feelings and integrity of his staff and customers Spica's despicable behaviour causes many confrontations and he loses some of their company, but he gets away with taking their money. The one who suffers the most from his intolerable attitude is his finely bred and beautiful spouse Georgina Spica, the Wife (Dame Helen Mirren) who is forced into joining in his activities, and she often is victim to his abusive comments and occasional disrespectful actions. She has obviously had enough, and she soon enough catches the eye of and starts a passionate affair with bookshop owner and regular restaurant customer Michael, the Lover (Alan Howard), and with the help of the staff she manages to continue it right under her husband's nose. Eventually Spica does find out about the affair, and despite having no clothes Georgina and Michael escape from his raging tirade in the back of a truck containing rotting meat and vegetables, and they hide out in the bookshop, the always singing soprano boy working at the restaurant brings them food provided by Borst. Spica tortures the boy to find out where the bookshop is, and while Georgina is with the boy recovering in hospital, Spica's men torture Michael, force-feeding him pages from his books, choking and bleeding him to death, and Georgina discovers his body when she returns. In grief and rage she decides to exact her revenge on her husband in the only way she knows how, the gangster was heard shouting that he would kill and eat Michael when he found him, so she begs Borst to take Michael's body and to cook it, after a while of refusal he eventually agrees to this. The end sees Spica losing his restaurant business with financial downfall, and all the people he was horrible to him are gathered to watch his comeuppance, and Georgina brings out the cooked body of Michael and forces Spica at gunpoint to eat a mouthful of the body, forcing him to gag, and she shoots dead. Also starring Tim Roth as Mitchel, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Cory, Gary Olsen as Spangler, Ewan Stewart as Harris, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Turpin, Ron Cook as Mews, Liz Smith as Grace, Doctor Who's Alex Kingston as Adele, singer Ian Dury as Terry Fitch, Diane Langton as May Fitch and Roger Lloyd-Pack as Geoff. Gambon gives a brilliantly grotesque performance as the cruel and hateful criminal who only cares about himself, Mirren is really good clothed and unclothed as the long suffering wife who finds strength and true love, and the supporting cast all get their good moments as well, and the direction of Peter Greenaway is well paced and executed. This film obviously made an impact during the time of its release, especially for its controversial and thought provoking material, the use of nudity and graphic violence and dark sense of humour, the best scenes are definitely a sex scene at the same time as some chopping and food preparation and of course the hilariously gross ending, I would absolutely recommend this risqu&eacute; and marvellous black comedy drama. Dame Helen Mirren was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses, the film was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    I found this film to be highly entertaining. The colors, soundtrack and the cinematography were very interesting. Nothing really absurdly great, though. I mean, it is artsy in some level, but it is not "that" artsy. Though, it wasn't a masterpiece by any means: I saw 8 1/2 in the same day and it's mythical awesomeness contrasts with this highly awesome film still restricted to a mortal level of greatness. It is a good film, but not a great film. Its a dark comedy and it is sure to make people less "accustomed" to film than I am to be impressed/disgusted by some of the scenes.

    Those who are attracted to the latest wave of torture porn movies probably didn't know that the high-brows had a go at it way back in 1989. That truly is what this film represents. An "artistic" amalgam of adolescent bathroom humor and stomach turning violence and deep depravity. All served up in an in-your-face metaphor of feasting equals fornication. It is all garnished with baroque imagery, primary color saturation, and operatic pretensions. This is vile, vacuous, and venomous and is recommended for those with a strong constitution or for viewers who inhabit the boundaries and patrol the edge for "entertainment" and possibly those interested to see what the upper crust is up to.

    I see that quite a few people got quite a bit out of this. I see some of it. Some I see not at all. But what IS important here is that this film can generate such discussions, such thoughts, such artistry and philosophical posing(phrasing if you prefer). I will look at the film straight-on(as much as possible) as it is undoubtedly surreal. It is other-worldly. The story in simplistic terms is about a horrible, vile, odious thief named Albert who has a lovely wife named Georgina - who is not satisfied on many levels with her brutish, vulgar, common, loud, sadistic thief husband. This husband owns perhaps the most chic restaurant in town. It is a tapestry of beautiful colors with a mix of unreality generously garnishing it. I have seen very few films that rival this in its use of colors and lighting(Mario Bava's films come to mind as someone similar). Director Peter Greenaway(also the writer) does such a splendid job "painting" this film for indeed it looks visually like a moving painting or poem or some other aesthetic endeavour. Anyway, I digress, this thief and his wife are eating dinner when the eyes of Georgina meet with those of a timid, bookish man named Michael eating and reading at his table. Their eye meeting is sex(not unseen in this case) and explodes eventually into physical passion. The affair is eventually uncovered and Voilla! we get one of the grossest, bizarre, poetic(again that word) denouements in film history. This film is not big on plot and action but on emotion, passion, feeling, disgust, hate, love, sex, etc... Greenaway is the real star with both his urbane, witty, sadistic script and, more importantly, with his eye for aesthetics and innate beauty. He creates a very real film in a very unreal world. The restaurant is like no other in the world. Its parking lot is the same. Even the meat trucks are done in the most grand guignol fashion and have more in common with a scene from Sweeney Todd then anything about meat. The kitchen is huge with one man shirtless, a small boy singing what sound like melodious fugues, and there is Richard the French cook who gets his crowning moment in the final act of the film. The music by Michael Nyman is almost as important as the director's artistic lens. It pervades and moves each scene. And finally, though not unimportant in any way, is the acting of Michael Gambon as Albert, Helen Mirren as Georgina, Richard Bohringer as Richard and Alan Howard as Michael. All shine in their roles but Mirren and Gambon are moving. Mirren, the woman who won an Oscar playing Elizabeth II, is just the sexiest thing on screen in her lingerie, or eating her asparagus, or caressing her lover. She, like the camera lens, the music, moves symphonically. Gambon, however; is the real acting star. He is the pillar of disgust. He is putrid. He is wonderful in his role. I would even go so far to say he is delicious(but let's leave that for Alan Howard shall we). I guess I am gushing. This film deserves it. I do not often sit down to watch something and just become entranced with it. I knew when I finished this film that I had witnessed not just a film nor a great film but art. The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover is just that. Make no mistake.

The use of colour is quite brilliant, even down to the actor's costume changing colour as they move from room to room. I thought the music fitted the piece quite brilliantly too (aside from the operatic stuff  those that have seen it will know what I'm referring to). All the performances were excellent; in particular Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon; they both really shone in this one! It's certainly one I'll be seeing again sometime and one I heartily recommend although some may find certain scenes distasteful (definitely not for the youngsters!). SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.9/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    I heard about this film because of its sexual content and a few of the actors starring before finding out it one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die in the book of the same name, so that made me even more keen to see it. Basically high-class Le Hollandais Restaurant, run by French chef Richard Borst, the Cook (Richard Bohringer) has been taken over by vicious, malevolent and sadistic English gangster Albert Spica, the Thief (Sir Michael Gambon), and he makes numerous nightly appearances at the restaurant as host to dining parties of fellow thugs. With no interest and respect for the feelings and integrity of his staff and customers Spica's despicable behaviour causes many confrontations and he loses some of their company, but he gets away with taking their money. The one who suffers the most from his intolerable attitude is his finely bred and beautiful spouse Georgina Spica, the Wife (Dame Helen Mirren) who is forced into joining in his activities, and she often is victim to his abusive comments and occasional disrespectful actions. She has obviously had enough, and she soon enough catches the eye of and starts a passionate affair with bookshop owner and regular restaurant customer Michael, the Lover (Alan Howard), and with the help of the staff she manages to continue it right under her husband's nose. Eventually Spica does find out about the affair, and despite having no clothes Georgina and Michael escape from his raging tirade in the back of a truck containing rotting meat and vegetables, and they hide out in the bookshop, the always singing soprano boy working at the restaurant brings them food provided by Borst. Spica tortures the boy to find out where the bookshop is, and while Georgina is with the boy recovering in hospital, Spica's men torture Michael, force-feeding him pages from his books, choking and bleeding him to death, and Georgina discovers his body when she returns. In grief and rage she decides to exact her revenge on her husband in the only way she knows how, the gangster was heard shouting that he would kill and eat Michael when he found him, so she begs Borst to take Michael's body and to cook it, after a while of refusal he eventually agrees to this. The end sees Spica losing his restaurant business with financial downfall, and all the people he was horrible to him are gathered to watch his comeuppance, and Georgina brings out the cooked body of Michael and forces Spica at gunpoint to eat a mouthful of the body, forcing him to gag, and she shoots dead. Also starring Tim Roth as Mitchel, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Cory, Gary Olsen as Spangler, Ewan Stewart as Harris, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Turpin, Ron Cook as Mews, Liz Smith as Grace, Doctor Who's Alex Kingston as Adele, singer Ian Dury as Terry Fitch, Diane Langton as May Fitch and Roger Lloyd-Pack as Geoff. Gambon gives a brilliantly grotesque performance as the cruel and hateful criminal who only cares about himself, Mirren is really good clothed and unclothed as the long suffering wife who finds strength and true love, and the supporting cast all get their good moments as well, and the direction of Peter Greenaway is well paced and executed. This film obviously made an impact during the time of its release, especially for its controversial and thought provoking material, the use of nudity and graphic violence and dark sense of humour, the best scenes are definitely a sex scene at the same time as some chopping and food preparation and of course the hilariously gross ending, I would absolutely recommend this risqu&eacute; and marvellous black comedy drama. Dame Helen Mirren was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses, the film was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    I found this film to be highly entertaining. The colors, soundtrack and the cinematography were very interesting. Nothing really absurdly great, though. I mean, it is artsy in some level, but it is not "that" artsy. Though, it wasn't a masterpiece by any means: I saw 8 1/2 in the same day and it's mythical awesomeness contrasts with this highly awesome film still restricted to a mortal level of greatness. It is a good film, but not a great film. Its a dark comedy and it is sure to make people less "accustomed" to film than I am to be impressed/disgusted by some of the scenes.

    Those who are attracted to the latest wave of torture porn movies probably didn't know that the high-brows had a go at it way back in 1989. That truly is what this film represents. An "artistic" amalgam of adolescent bathroom humor and stomach turning violence and deep depravity. All served up in an in-your-face metaphor of feasting equals fornication. It is all garnished with baroque imagery, primary color saturation, and operatic pretensions. This is vile, vacuous, and venomous and is recommended for those with a strong constitution or for viewers who inhabit the boundaries and patrol the edge for "entertainment" and possibly those interested to see what the upper crust is up to.

    I see that quite a few people got quite a bit out of this. I see some of it. Some I see not at all. But what IS important here is that this film can generate such discussions, such thoughts, such artistry and philosophical posing(phrasing if you prefer). I will look at the film straight-on(as much as possible) as it is undoubtedly surreal. It is other-worldly. The story in simplistic terms is about a horrible, vile, odious thief named Albert who has a lovely wife named Georgina - who is not satisfied on many levels with her brutish, vulgar, common, loud, sadistic thief husband. This husband owns perhaps the most chic restaurant in town. It is a tapestry of beautiful colors with a mix of unreality generously garnishing it. I have seen very few films that rival this in its use of colors and lighting(Mario Bava's films come to mind as someone similar). Director Peter Greenaway(also the writer) does such a splendid job "painting" this film for indeed it looks visually like a moving painting or poem or some other aesthetic endeavour. Anyway, I digress, this thief and his wife are eating dinner when the eyes of Georgina meet with those of a timid, bookish man named Michael eating and reading at his table. Their eye meeting is sex(not unseen in this case) and explodes eventually into physical passion. The affair is eventually uncovered and Voilla! we get one of the grossest, bizarre, poetic(again that word) denouements in film history. This film is not big on plot and action but on emotion, passion, feeling, disgust, hate, love, sex, etc... Greenaway is the real star with both his urbane, witty, sadistic script and, more importantly, with his eye for aesthetics and innate beauty. He creates a very real film in a very unreal world. The restaurant is like no other in the world. Its parking lot is the same. Even the meat trucks are done in the most grand guignol fashion and have more in common with a scene from Sweeney Todd then anything about meat. The kitchen is huge with one man shirtless, a small boy singing what sound like melodious fugues, and there is Richard the French cook who gets his crowning moment in the final act of the film. The music by Michael Nyman is almost as important as the director's artistic lens. It pervades and moves each scene. And finally, though not unimportant in any way, is the acting of Michael Gambon as Albert, Helen Mirren as Georgina, Richard Bohringer as Richard and Alan Howard as Michael. All shine in their roles but Mirren and Gambon are moving. Mirren, the woman who won an Oscar playing Elizabeth II, is just the sexiest thing on screen in her lingerie, or eating her asparagus, or caressing her lover. She, like the camera lens, the music, moves symphonically. Gambon, however; is the real acting star. He is the pillar of disgust. He is putrid. He is wonderful in his role. I would even go so far to say he is delicious(but let's leave that for Alan Howard shall we). I guess I am gushing. This film deserves it. I do not often sit down to watch something and just become entranced with it. I knew when I finished this film that I had witnessed not just a film nor a great film but art. The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover is just that. Make no mistake.

    Spoilers: movie's narrative given in parts, action discerned. Why did Greenaway become Dutch, that reasonably hard and eclectic of nations? Greenaway loathes the English male. Michael the Bibliophile is as soft a 'man' as you'll find. Spica, a successful gangster is vile as his antithesis. Yet the interplay of two Englishmen is not sufficient to save the male in general. Borst, a French restaurateur creates value artistically with superb cuisine and decor. Unfortunately, as a man Borst is unable to save his restaurant from Spica's criminality and worse, Spica's anosognosic attempts to become a gastronome. The English male either despoils or when he does not he is as limp as the asparagus Michael feeds to Georgina. Both Spica and Michael feel they are superior, the former by possessing power and ownership, the latter arcane knowledge. Not enough to save either. As for the wonderful boy soprano, who has angelic purity of voice, even that is not enough to stave off Spica. Greenaway's middle period films finds males popping off the Loakes in rapid order. And like the middle period films Nyman's music contributes greatly. The important question is not to simply mention Hals' Banquet of the Officers as a reference to the Netherlands Glorietijd. It is to draw parallel the world of Spica, sitting underneath the officers as one who through misdeed and ruthlessness made his money. With it Spica has become whatever he wanted to be. He bought a slice of society and its values, yet this very gauche road to power is a process through which he undermines his acquisition, a robber baron capitalist par excellence. As the relationship between capitalism and oil painting has moved from Marxist critique (Berger) to mainstream thinking so does Spica move from the red room of capitalism to the engine rooms of kitchen with Indian (colonial) cooks, where Georgina and Michael find love and pleasure in prep rooms, storage rooms of differing colours and significance. Fragile qualities hide from driving, controlling capitalists with Spica's linear intrusion into these areas. Love and meaning, the pleasure of sensuality is found in each other as in the food Borst specially prepares for them. While monied art sought permanency in oils art as a live expression like Georgina's relationship with Michael is fleeting. When (gangster) capitalism no longer harnesses but believes it is responsible for output a train wreck ensues. The foreshadowing of Spica's demise is the chap in the opening sequence who "doesn't understand finer things." Eventually the creative (Borst), the oppressed (Georgina) and the factors of production (staff), rebel.

    My favourite film of all time. Sure, feel free to take that statement with a considerable pinch of salt; anybody who takes even the most cursory of glances at my page will know that I'm not exactly the world's biggest fan of films as a whole. Yet I, and those who look further into my ratings, know that I've simply been exposed to the wrong things over and over again (I have, for instance, rated no less than 12 Adam Sandler films, and a mighty and embarrassing 17 Jack Black films). The upshot of that is the reaction I have when I'm exposed to something that's not complete garbage - it's like a epiphany. With The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover, that reaction was stronger than with any other film I've seen. If I had to pinpoint the reason that this film blew apart my conceptions of how good a film could actually be, I'd point to the attention to detail paid to every individual aspect of the experience. In terms of production, this is like a populist Koyaanisqatsi - a genuine expert handles each field in collaboration with each other, with Michael Nyman offering a fantastic score, and Jean-Paul Gaultier designing the costumes, leaving Peter Greenaway to focus on the rest of the visuals. Even the food is designed by celebrity chef Giorgio Locatelli. The fact that these three collaborators are all allowed to leave genuine traces of their own personalities makes the entire film so much richer, so much more alive. But maybe it's simpler than that; maybe it's the feel of the plot that had me so absorbed from the off. There's real humour here, but it's so dark, so sarcastic, and so morbid that it almost slides under the radar. It feels very British to me, and it reminds me specifically of Chris Morris - there's a dichotomy about the humour, a push-and-pull between the need to make a point, and the childish desire to poke people with a stick just to see how they react. This is a film that pushes buttons, obvious buttons even, but it does so in a way that's definitely funny if you can get yourself into the right mindset (or if you just have a dumb, twisted sense of humour, which is an accusation I'm happy to field). Also, boobs. Whatever it is, this is a vivid, colourful (literally as well as figuratively), amusing, intelligent, fascinating, disturbing, fully realized, perfectly paced, utterly fantastic film. My quest since seeing it has been to find another film as good. So far, I haven't succeeded.

    I must confess that the only reason I watched this film was because it starred Helen Mirren who I knew took her clothes of in it. Sad maybe but there you are! Apart from this I didn't really know what else to expect as I knew nothing of the storyline. However, from the start I was quite taken aback by the sheer unpleasantness of it all. I know that it is supposed to have many meanings but all I remember is Michael Gambon's character being pretty awful to everyone and some poor book seller ending up on the dinner table. Even the nude scenes where a disappointment as the lighting appeared rather dim and fuzzy. Apart from Helen who oozes sex and sophistication I liked nothing else about this film. Repulsive rubbish!!

    The cruel and sadistic crime boss Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) has dinner every night in his restaurant with his wife Georgina Spica (Helen Mirren) and his gang. Albert abuses of his wife, his gangsters, the chef Richard Borst (Richard Bohringer) and the restaurant employees. When Georgina meets the gentle bookseller Michael (Alan Howard) in the restaurant, they have a torrid affair in the restroom and in the store, and they are covered by Richard. However the prostitute Pat discloses to Albert that he has been betrayed by Georgina and Albert kills Michael. However Georgina plots revenge against Albert with the support of Richard and the victims of Albert. "The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover" is one of the most grotesque, eschatological, bizarre and weird films that I have ever seen. But it is also absolutely original and mesmerizing, with intense use of colors, and with the contrast of vulgarity and art. Food, eschatology, sex, cruelty, torture, cannibalism and revenge are entwined along 124 minutes running time. The result is not pleasant and only specific audiences will appreciate this film. Last time I had seen this film was on 08 September 2000 on VHS. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Cozinheiro, o Ladr&atilde;o, Sua Mulher e o Amante" ("The Cook the Thief, His Wife and the Lover")

    I have a problem with art-house films like THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER and it's that the directors of such fare are often totally ignorant when it comes to decent film-making. Sure, they obsess over designer costumes and make-up, and they focus intently on the colour palette of their movies, but when it comes to movie-making staples like pace, character, dialogue, and intrigue, they fail. Peter Greenaway is such a director. This controversial 1989 opus is known for its gruesome scenes of cannibalism, yet take away the controversy and there's absolutely nothing here to rate this. The running time is as slow as a snail, and much of it is made up of scenes of the repulsive Michael Gambon character berating his wife and associates. Greenaway's a better director than he is a writer, because the script is terrible. We get the gist of Gambon's character and the situation with his wife in the first ten minutes, yet two hours of non-action go by in which we're bludgeoned over the head with his sheer monotonous brutish nature. The whole film takes place on a cheap-looking set that quickly becomes boring, Helen Mirren spends most of the running time naked and forgets how to act, and luminaries such as Tim Roth and Ciaran Hinds are wasted. Yes, there are a few shocking scenes, yet cannibalism is dealt with in a much more entertaining fashion in both B-movie fare (such as Pete Walker's 1974 FRIGHTMARE) and Hollywood flicks (like RAVENOUS). I'm not against arty films where nothing happens, but there has to be substance to go with the style; Nic Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW is a case in point: one of my favourite films of all time, but hardly action-packed. THE COOK... just wastes a great deal of potential and proves to be another case of The Emperor's New Clothes.

It is to draw parallel the world of Spica, sitting underneath the officers as one who through misdeed and ruthlessness made his money. With it Spica has become whatever he wanted to be. He bought a slice of society and its values, yet this very gauche road to power is a process through which he undermines his acquisition, a robber baron capitalist par excellence. As the relationship between capitalism and oil painting has moved from Marxist critique (Berger) to mainstream thinking so does Spica move from the red room of capitalism to the engine rooms of kitchen with Indian (colonial) cooks, where Georgina and Michael find love and pleasure in prep rooms, storage rooms of differing colours and significance. Fragile qualities hide from driving, controlling capitalists with Spica's linear intrusion into these areas. Love and meaning, the pleasure of sensuality is found in each other as in the food Borst specially prepares for them. While monied art sought permanency in oils art as a live expression like Georgina's relationship with Michael is fleeting. When (gangster) capitalism no longer harnesses but believes it is responsible for output a train wreck ensues. The foreshadowing of Spica's demise is the chap in the opening sequence who "doesn't understand finer things." Eventually the creative (Borst), the oppressed (Georgina) and the factors of production (staff), rebel.

    My favourite film of all time. Sure, feel free to take that statement with a considerable pinch of salt; anybody who takes even the most cursory of glances at my page will know that I'm not exactly the world's biggest fan of films as a whole. Yet I, and those who look further into my ratings, know that I've simply been exposed to the wrong things over and over again (I have, for instance, rated no less than 12 Adam Sandler films, and a mighty and embarrassing 17 Jack Black films). The upshot of that is the reaction I have when I'm exposed to something that's not complete garbage - it's like a epiphany. With The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover, that reaction was stronger than with any other film I've seen. If I had to pinpoint the reason that this film blew apart my conceptions of how good a film could actually be, I'd point to the attention to detail paid to every individual aspect of the experience. In terms of production, this is like a populist Koyaanisqatsi - a genuine expert handles each field in collaboration with each other, with Michael Nyman offering a fantastic score, and Jean-Paul Gaultier designing the costumes, leaving Peter Greenaway to focus on the rest of the visuals. Even the food is designed by celebrity chef Giorgio Locatelli. The fact that these three collaborators are all allowed to leave genuine traces of their own personalities makes the entire film so much richer, so much more alive. But maybe it's simpler than that; maybe it's the feel of the plot that had me so absorbed from the off. There's real humour here, but it's so dark, so sarcastic, and so morbid that it almost slides under the radar. It feels very British to me, and it reminds me specifically of Chris Morris - there's a dichotomy about the humour, a push-and-pull between the need to make a point, and the childish desire to poke people with a stick just to see how they react. This is a film that pushes buttons, obvious buttons even, but it does so in a way that's definitely funny if you can get yourself into the right mindset (or if you just have a dumb, twisted sense of humour, which is an accusation I'm happy to field). Also, boobs. Whatever it is, this is a vivid, colourful (literally as well as figuratively), amusing, intelligent, fascinating, disturbing, fully realized, perfectly paced, utterly fantastic film. My quest since seeing it has been to find another film as good. So far, I haven't succeeded.

    I must confess that the only reason I watched this film was because it starred Helen Mirren who I knew took her clothes of in it. Sad maybe but there you are! Apart from this I didn't really know what else to expect as I knew nothing of the storyline. However, from the start I was quite taken aback by the sheer unpleasantness of it all. I know that it is supposed to have many meanings but all I remember is Michael Gambon's character being pretty awful to everyone and some poor book seller ending up on the dinner table. Even the nude scenes where a disappointment as the lighting appeared rather dim and fuzzy. Apart from Helen who oozes sex and sophistication I liked nothing else about this film. Repulsive rubbish!!

    The cruel and sadistic crime boss Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) has dinner every night in his restaurant with his wife Georgina Spica (Helen Mirren) and his gang. Albert abuses of his wife, his gangsters, the chef Richard Borst (Richard Bohringer) and the restaurant employees. When Georgina meets the gentle bookseller Michael (Alan Howard) in the restaurant, they have a torrid affair in the restroom and in the store, and they are covered by Richard. However the prostitute Pat discloses to Albert that he has been betrayed by Georgina and Albert kills Michael. However Georgina plots revenge against Albert with the support of Richard and the victims of Albert. "The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover" is one of the most grotesque, eschatological, bizarre and weird films that I have ever seen. But it is also absolutely original and mesmerizing, with intense use of colors, and with the contrast of vulgarity and art. Food, eschatology, sex, cruelty, torture, cannibalism and revenge are entwined along 124 minutes running time. The result is not pleasant and only specific audiences will appreciate this film. Last time I had seen this film was on 08 September 2000 on VHS. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Cozinheiro, o Ladr&atilde;o, Sua Mulher e o Amante" ("The Cook the Thief, His Wife and the Lover")

    I have a problem with art-house films like THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER and it's that the directors of such fare are often totally ignorant when it comes to decent film-making. Sure, they obsess over designer costumes and make-up, and they focus intently on the colour palette of their movies, but when it comes to movie-making staples like pace, character, dialogue, and intrigue, they fail. Peter Greenaway is such a director. This controversial 1989 opus is known for its gruesome scenes of cannibalism, yet take away the controversy and there's absolutely nothing here to rate this. The running time is as slow as a snail, and much of it is made up of scenes of the repulsive Michael Gambon character berating his wife and associates. Greenaway's a better director than he is a writer, because the script is terrible. We get the gist of Gambon's character and the situation with his wife in the first ten minutes, yet two hours of non-action go by in which we're bludgeoned over the head with his sheer monotonous brutish nature. The whole film takes place on a cheap-looking set that quickly becomes boring, Helen Mirren spends most of the running time naked and forgets how to act, and luminaries such as Tim Roth and Ciaran Hinds are wasted. Yes, there are a few shocking scenes, yet cannibalism is dealt with in a much more entertaining fashion in both B-movie fare (such as Pete Walker's 1974 FRIGHTMARE) and Hollywood flicks (like RAVENOUS). I'm not against arty films where nothing happens, but there has to be substance to go with the style; Nic Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW is a case in point: one of my favourite films of all time, but hardly action-packed. THE COOK... just wastes a great deal of potential and proves to be another case of The Emperor's New Clothes.

    I love the visual style of this film; it's very theatrical but with huge backdrops; some of the scenes in the restaurant almost look like they're filmed in an aircraft hanger. The use of colour is quite brilliant, even down to the actor's costume changing colour as they move from room to room. I thought the music fitted the piece quite brilliantly too (aside from the operatic stuff  those that have seen it will know what I'm referring to). All the performances were excellent; in particular Helen Mirren and Michael Gambon; they both really shone in this one! It's certainly one I'll be seeing again sometime and one I heartily recommend although some may find certain scenes distasteful (definitely not for the youngsters!). SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.9/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    I heard about this film because of its sexual content and a few of the actors starring before finding out it one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die in the book of the same name, so that made me even more keen to see it. Basically high-class Le Hollandais Restaurant, run by French chef Richard Borst, the Cook (Richard Bohringer) has been taken over by vicious, malevolent and sadistic English gangster Albert Spica, the Thief (Sir Michael Gambon), and he makes numerous nightly appearances at the restaurant as host to dining parties of fellow thugs. With no interest and respect for the feelings and integrity of his staff and customers Spica's despicable behaviour causes many confrontations and he loses some of their company, but he gets away with taking their money. The one who suffers the most from his intolerable attitude is his finely bred and beautiful spouse Georgina Spica, the Wife (Dame Helen Mirren) who is forced into joining in his activities, and she often is victim to his abusive comments and occasional disrespectful actions. She has obviously had enough, and she soon enough catches the eye of and starts a passionate affair with bookshop owner and regular restaurant customer Michael, the Lover (Alan Howard), and with the help of the staff she manages to continue it right under her husband's nose. Eventually Spica does find out about the affair, and despite having no clothes Georgina and Michael escape from his raging tirade in the back of a truck containing rotting meat and vegetables, and they hide out in the bookshop, the always singing soprano boy working at the restaurant brings them food provided by Borst. Spica tortures the boy to find out where the bookshop is, and while Georgina is with the boy recovering in hospital, Spica's men torture Michael, force-feeding him pages from his books, choking and bleeding him to death, and Georgina discovers his body when she returns. In grief and rage she decides to exact her revenge on her husband in the only way she knows how, the gangster was heard shouting that he would kill and eat Michael when he found him, so she begs Borst to take Michael's body and to cook it, after a while of refusal he eventually agrees to this. The end sees Spica losing his restaurant business with financial downfall, and all the people he was horrible to him are gathered to watch his comeuppance, and Georgina brings out the cooked body of Michael and forces Spica at gunpoint to eat a mouthful of the body, forcing him to gag, and she shoots dead. Also starring Tim Roth as Mitchel, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Cory, Gary Olsen as Spangler, Ewan Stewart as Harris, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Turpin, Ron Cook as Mews, Liz Smith as Grace, Doctor Who's Alex Kingston as Adele, singer Ian Dury as Terry Fitch, Diane Langton as May Fitch and Roger Lloyd-Pack as Geoff. Gambon gives a brilliantly grotesque performance as the cruel and hateful criminal who only cares about himself, Mirren is really good clothed and unclothed as the long suffering wife who finds strength and true love, and the supporting cast all get their good moments as well, and the direction of Peter Greenaway is well paced and executed. This film obviously made an impact during the time of its release, especially for its controversial and thought provoking material, the use of nudity and graphic violence and dark sense of humour, the best scenes are definitely a sex scene at the same time as some chopping and food preparation and of course the hilariously gross ending, I would absolutely recommend this risqu&eacute; and marvellous black comedy drama. Dame Helen Mirren was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses, the film was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    I found this film to be highly entertaining. The colors, soundtrack and the cinematography were very interesting. Nothing really absurdly great, though. I mean, it is artsy in some level, but it is not "that" artsy. Though, it wasn't a masterpiece by any means: I saw 8 1/2 in the same day and it's mythical awesomeness contrasts with this highly awesome film still restricted to a mortal level of greatness. It is a good film, but not a great film. Its a dark comedy and it is sure to make people less "accustomed" to film than I am to be impressed/disgusted by some of the scenes.

    Those who are attracted to the latest wave of torture porn movies probably didn't know that the high-brows had a go at it way back in 1989. That truly is what this film represents. An "artistic" amalgam of adolescent bathroom humor and stomach turning violence and deep depravity. All served up in an in-your-face metaphor of feasting equals fornication. It is all garnished with baroque imagery, primary color saturation, and operatic pretensions. This is vile, vacuous, and venomous and is recommended for those with a strong constitution or for viewers who inhabit the boundaries and patrol the edge for "entertainment" and possibly those interested to see what the upper crust is up to.

    I see that quite a few people got quite a bit out of this. I see some of it. Some I see not at all. But what IS important here is that this film can generate such discussions, such thoughts, such artistry and philosophical posing(phrasing if you prefer). I will look at the film straight-on(as much as possible) as it is undoubtedly surreal. It is other-worldly. The story in simplistic terms is about a horrible, vile, odious thief named Albert who has a lovely wife named Georgina - who is not satisfied on many levels with her brutish, vulgar, common, loud, sadistic thief husband. This husband owns perhaps the most chic restaurant in town. It is a tapestry of beautiful colors with a mix of unreality generously garnishing it. I have seen very few films that rival this in its use of colors and lighting(Mario Bava's films come to mind as someone similar). Director Peter Greenaway(also the writer) does such a splendid job "painting" this film for indeed it looks visually like a moving painting or poem or some other aesthetic endeavour. Anyway, I digress, this thief and his wife are eating dinner when the eyes of Georgina meet with those of a timid, bookish man named Michael eating and reading at his table. Their eye meeting is sex(not unseen in this case) and explodes eventually into physical passion. The affair is eventually uncovered and Voilla! we get one of the grossest, bizarre, poetic(again that word) denouements in film history. This film is not big on plot and action but on emotion, passion, feeling, disgust, hate, love, sex, etc... Greenaway is the real star with both his urbane, witty, sadistic script and, more importantly, with his eye for aesthetics and innate beauty. He creates a very real film in a very unreal world. The restaurant is like no other in the world. Its parking lot is the same. Even the meat trucks are done in the most grand guignol fashion and have more in common with a scene from Sweeney Todd then anything about meat. The kitchen is huge with one man shirtless, a small boy singing what sound like melodious fugues, and there is Richard the French cook who gets his crowning moment in the final act of the film. The music by Michael Nyman is almost as important as the director's artistic lens. It pervades and moves each scene. And finally, though not unimportant in any way, is the acting of Michael Gambon as Albert, Helen Mirren as Georgina, Richard Bohringer as Richard and Alan Howard as Michael. All shine in their roles but Mirren and Gambon are moving. Mirren, the woman who won an Oscar playing Elizabeth II, is just the sexiest thing on screen in her lingerie, or eating her asparagus, or caressing her lover. She, like the camera lens, the music, moves symphonically. Gambon, however; is the real acting star. He is the pillar of disgust. He is putrid. He is wonderful in his role. I would even go so far to say he is delicious(but let's leave that for Alan Howard shall we). I guess I am gushing. This film deserves it. I do not often sit down to watch something and just become entranced with it. I knew when I finished this film that I had witnessed not just a film nor a great film but art. The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover is just that. Make no mistake.

    Spoilers: movie's narrative given in parts, action discerned. Why did Greenaway become Dutch, that reasonably hard and eclectic of nations? Greenaway loathes the English male. Michael the Bibliophile is as soft a 'man' as you'll find. Spica, a successful gangster is vile as his antithesis. Yet the interplay of two Englishmen is not sufficient to save the male in general. Borst, a French restaurateur creates value artistically with superb cuisine and decor. Unfortunately, as a man Borst is unable to save his restaurant from Spica's criminality and worse, Spica's anosognosic attempts to become a gastronome. The English male either despoils or when he does not he is as limp as the asparagus Michael feeds to Georgina. Both Spica and Michael feel they are superior, the former by possessing power and ownership, the latter arcane knowledge. Not enough to save either. As for the wonderful boy soprano, who has angelic purity of voice, even that is not enough to stave off Spica. Greenaway's middle period films finds males popping off the Loakes in rapid order. And like the middle period films Nyman's music contributes greatly. The important question is not to simply mention Hals' Banquet of the Officers as a reference to the Netherlands Glorietijd. It is to draw parallel the world of Spica, sitting underneath the officers as one who through misdeed and ruthlessness made his money. With it Spica has become whatever he wanted to be.

When (gangster) capitalism no longer harnesses but believes it is responsible for output a train wreck ensues.

She has obviously had enough, and she soon enough catches the eye of and starts a passionate affair with bookshop owner and regular restaurant customer Michael, the Lover (Alan Howard), and with the help of the staff she manages to continue it right under her husband's nose. Eventually Spica does find out about the affair, and despite having no clothes Georgina and Michael escape from his raging tirade in the back of a truck containing rotting meat and vegetables, and they hide out in the bookshop, the always singing soprano boy working at the restaurant brings them food provided by Borst. Spica tortures the boy to find out where the bookshop is, and while Georgina is with the boy recovering in hospital, Spica's men torture Michael, force-feeding him pages from his books, choking and bleeding him to death, and Georgina discovers his body when she returns. In grief and rage she decides to exact her revenge on her husband in the only way she knows how, the gangster was heard shouting that he would kill and eat Michael when he found him, so she begs Borst to take Michael's body and to cook it, after a while of refusal he eventually agrees to this. The end sees Spica losing his restaurant business with financial downfall, and all the people he was horrible to him are gathered to watch his comeuppance, and Georgina brings out the cooked body of Michael and forces Spica at gunpoint to eat a mouthful of the body, forcing him to gag, and she shoots dead. Also starring Tim Roth as Mitchel, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Cory, Gary Olsen as Spangler, Ewan Stewart as Harris, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Turpin, Ron Cook as Mews, Liz Smith as Grace, Doctor Who's Alex Kingston as Adele, singer Ian Dury as Terry Fitch, Diane Langton as May Fitch and Roger Lloyd-Pack as Geoff. Gambon gives a brilliantly grotesque performance as the cruel and hateful criminal who only cares about himself, Mirren is really good clothed and unclothed as the long suffering wife who finds strength and true love, and the supporting cast all get their good moments as well, and the direction of Peter Greenaway is well paced and executed. This film obviously made an impact during the time of its release, especially for its controversial and thought provoking material, the use of nudity and graphic violence and dark sense of humour, the best scenes are definitely a sex scene at the same time as some chopping and food preparation and of course the hilariously gross ending, I would absolutely recommend this risqu&eacute; and marvellous black comedy drama. Dame Helen Mirren was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses, the film was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!

    I found this film to be highly entertaining. The colors, soundtrack and the cinematography were very interesting. Nothing really absurdly great, though. I mean, it is artsy in some level, but it is not "that" artsy. Though, it wasn't a masterpiece by any means: I saw 8 1/2 in the same day and it's mythical awesomeness contrasts with this highly awesome film still restricted to a mortal level of greatness. It is a good film, but not a great film. Its a dark comedy and it is sure to make people less "accustomed" to film than I am to be impressed/disgusted by some of the scenes.

    Those who are attracted to the latest wave of torture porn movies probably didn't know that the high-brows had a go at it way back in 1989. That truly is what this film represents. An "artistic" amalgam of adolescent bathroom humor and stomach turning violence and deep depravity. All served up in an in-your-face metaphor of feasting equals fornication. It is all garnished with baroque imagery, primary color saturation, and operatic pretensions. This is vile, vacuous, and venomous and is recommended for those with a strong constitution or for viewers who inhabit the boundaries and patrol the edge for "entertainment" and possibly those interested to see what the upper crust is up to.

    I see that quite a few people got quite a bit out of this. I see some of it. Some I see not at all. But what IS important here is that this film can generate such discussions, such thoughts, such artistry and philosophical posing(phrasing if you prefer). I will look at the film straight-on(as much as possible) as it is undoubtedly surreal. It is other-worldly. The story in simplistic terms is about a horrible, vile, odious thief named Albert who has a lovely wife named Georgina - who is not satisfied on many levels with her brutish, vulgar, common, loud, sadistic thief husband. This husband owns perhaps the most chic restaurant in town. It is a tapestry of beautiful colors with a mix of unreality generously garnishing it. I have seen very few films that rival this in its use of colors and lighting(Mario Bava's films come to mind as someone similar). Director Peter Greenaway(also the writer) does such a splendid job "painting" this film for indeed it looks visually like a moving painting or poem or some other aesthetic endeavour. Anyway, I digress, this thief and his wife are eating dinner when the eyes of Georgina meet with those of a timid, bookish man named Michael eating and reading at his table. Their eye meeting is sex(not unseen in this case) and explodes eventually into physical passion. The affair is eventually uncovered and Voilla! we get one of the grossest, bizarre, poetic(again that word) denouements in film history. This film is not big on plot and action but on emotion, passion, feeling, disgust, hate, love, sex, etc... Greenaway is the real star with both his urbane, witty, sadistic script and, more importantly, with his eye for aesthetics and innate beauty. He creates a very real film in a very unreal world. The restaurant is like no other in the world. Its parking lot is the same. Even the meat trucks are done in the most grand guignol fashion and have more in common with a scene from Sweeney Todd then anything about meat. The kitchen is huge with one man shirtless, a small boy singing what sound like melodious fugues, and there is Richard the French cook who gets his crowning moment in the final act of the film. The music by Michael Nyman is almost as important as the director's artistic lens. It pervades and moves each scene. And finally, though not unimportant in any way, is the acting of Michael Gambon as Albert, Helen Mirren as Georgina, Richard Bohringer as Richard and Alan Howard as Michael. All shine in their roles but Mirren and Gambon are moving. Mirren, the woman who won an Oscar playing Elizabeth II, is just the sexiest thing on screen in her lingerie, or eating her asparagus, or caressing her lover. She, like the camera lens, the music, moves symphonically. Gambon, however; is the real acting star. He is the pillar of disgust. He is putrid. He is wonderful in his role. I would even go so far to say he is delicious(but let's leave that for Alan Howard shall we). I guess I am gushing. This film deserves it. I do not often sit down to watch something and just become entranced with it. I knew when I finished this film that I had witnessed not just a film nor a great film but art. The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover is just that. Make no mistake.

    Spoilers: movie's narrative given in parts, action discerned. Why did Greenaway become Dutch, that reasonably hard and eclectic of nations? Greenaway loathes the English male. Michael the Bibliophile is as soft a 'man' as you'll find. Spica, a successful gangster is vile as his antithesis. Yet the interplay of two Englishmen is not sufficient to save the male in general. Borst, a French restaurateur creates value artistically with superb cuisine and decor. Unfortunately, as a man Borst is unable to save his restaurant from Spica's criminality and worse, Spica's anosognosic attempts to become a gastronome. The English male either despoils or when he does not he is as limp as the asparagus Michael feeds to Georgina. Both Spica and Michael feel they are superior, the former by possessing power and ownership, the latter arcane knowledge. Not enough to save either. As for the wonderful boy soprano, who has angelic purity of voice, even that is not enough to stave off Spica. Greenaway's middle period films finds males popping off the Loakes in rapid order. And like the middle period films Nyman's music contributes greatly. The important question is not to simply mention Hals' Banquet of the Officers as a reference to the Netherlands Glorietijd. It is to draw parallel the world of Spica, sitting underneath the officers as one who through misdeed and ruthlessness made his money. With it Spica has become whatever he wanted to be. He bought a slice of society and its values, yet this very gauche road to power is a process through which he undermines his acquisition, a robber baron capitalist par excellence. As the relationship between capitalism and oil painting has moved from Marxist critique (Berger) to mainstream thinking so does Spica move from the red room of capitalism to the engine rooms of kitchen with Indian (colonial) cooks, where Georgina and Michael find love and pleasure in prep rooms, storage rooms of differing colours and significance. Fragile qualities hide from driving, controlling capitalists with Spica's linear intrusion into these areas. Love and meaning, the pleasure of sensuality is found in each other as in the food Borst specially prepares for them. While monied art sought permanency in oils art as a live expression like Georgina's relationship with Michael is fleeting. When (gangster) capitalism no longer harnesses but believes it is responsible for output a train wreck ensues. The foreshadowing of Spica's demise is the chap in the opening sequence who "doesn't understand finer things." Eventually the creative (Borst), the oppressed (Georgina) and the factors of production (staff), rebel.

    My favourite film of all time. Sure, feel free to take that statement with a considerable pinch of salt; anybody who takes even the most cursory of glances at my page will know that I'm not exactly the world's biggest fan of films as a whole. Yet I, and those who look further into my ratings, know that I've simply been exposed to the wrong things over and over again (I have, for instance, rated no less than 12 Adam Sandler films, and a mighty and embarrassing 17 Jack Black films). The upshot of that is the reaction I have when I'm exposed to something that's not complete garbage - it's like a epiphany. With The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover, that reaction was stronger than with any other film I've seen. If I had to pinpoint the reason that this film blew apart my conceptions of how good a film could actually be, I'd point to the attention to detail paid to every individual aspect of the experience. In terms of production, this is like a populist Koyaanisqatsi - a genuine expert handles each field in collaboration with each other, with Michael Nyman offering a fantastic score, and Jean-Paul Gaultier designing the costumes, leaving Peter Greenaway to focus on the rest of the visuals. Even the food is designed by celebrity chef Giorgio Locatelli. The fact that these three collaborators are all allowed to leave genuine traces of their own personalities makes the entire film so much richer, so much more alive. But maybe it's simpler than that; maybe it's the feel of the plot that had me so absorbed from the off. There's real humour here, but it's so dark, so sarcastic, and so morbid that it almost slides under the radar. It feels very British to me, and it reminds me specifically of Chris Morris - there's a dichotomy about the humour, a push-and-pull between the need to make a point, and the childish desire to poke people with a stick just to see how they react. This is a film that pushes buttons, obvious buttons even, but it does so in a way that's definitely funny if you can get yourself into the right mindset (or if you just have a dumb, twisted sense of humour, which is an accusation I'm happy to field). Also, boobs. Whatever it is, this is a vivid, colourful (literally as well as figuratively), amusing, intelligent, fascinating, disturbing, fully realized, perfectly paced, utterly fantastic film. My quest since seeing it has been to find another film as good. So far, I haven't succeeded.

    I must confess that the only reason I watched this film was because it starred Helen Mirren who I knew took her clothes of in it. Sad maybe but there you are! Apart from this I didn't really know what else to expect as I knew nothing of the storyline. However, from the start I was quite taken aback by the sheer unpleasantness of it all. I know that it is supposed to have many meanings but all I remember is Michael Gambon's character being pretty awful to everyone and some poor book seller ending up on the dinner table. Even the nude scenes where a disappointment as the lighting appeared rather dim and fuzzy. Apart from Helen who oozes sex and sophistication I liked nothing else about this film. Repulsive rubbish!!

    The cruel and sadistic crime boss Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) has dinner every night in his restaurant with his wife Georgina Spica (Helen Mirren) and his gang. Albert abuses of his wife, his gangsters, the chef Richard Borst (Richard Bohringer) and the restaurant employees. When Georgina meets the gentle bookseller Michael (Alan Howard) in the restaurant, they have a torrid affair in the restroom and in the store, and they are covered by Richard. However the prostitute Pat discloses to Albert that he has been betrayed by Georgina and Albert kills Michael. However Georgina plots revenge against Albert with the support of Richard and the victims of Albert. "The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover" is one of the most grotesque, eschatological, bizarre and weird films that I have ever seen. But it is also absolutely original and mesmerizing, with intense use of colors, and with the contrast of vulgarity and art. Food, eschatology, sex, cruelty, torture, cannibalism and revenge are entwined along 124 minutes running time. The result is not pleasant and only specific audiences will appreciate this film. Last time I had seen this film was on 08 September 2000 on VHS. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "O Cozinheiro, o Ladr&atilde;o, Sua Mulher e o Amante" ("The Cook the Thief, His Wife and the Lover")
