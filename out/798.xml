 <sinopse>
  Two men, both hiding a deadly secret, are on a murderous rampage through the desert.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Jack meets Adrian out in Nevada. Adrian latches on to Jack, and won't go away. Jack tries to lose Adrian, but Adrian informs Jack not to mess with him, or he'll call the police because he knows Jack's secret. In the meantime, the car radio keeps blaring news reports of a serial killer in the area called "The Hatchet Man", as well as a theft of a huge sum of money from a local casino. Jack is concealing a briefcase, and wherever he and Adrian go, "The Hatchet Man" seems to strike within the vicinity!

    This even more perversely homoerotic spin on "The Hitcher" has Lance Hendricksen (with a somewhat unconvincing bulge of padded gut) as a respectable-looking businessman embezzler of 1 1/2 million bucks. On the lam, he unfortunately crosses paths with creepy, insinuating drifter Eric Roberts--the "Hatchet Man" of recent serial dismembering killings. The tension between them is nicely maintained--with very little graphic on screen violence--though it dissipates somewhat as the progress goes on. The big final twist works, though it won't come as a complete surprise to veteran viewers of psychothrillers. Roberts and Hendricksen are excellent, the support parts (most of them murder victims) are nicely played. This isn't the most intense of pederasty-disgraced writer-director Victor Salva's features, but it's intense enough, albeit falling short of the full payoff one expects. (There are scenes in "Jeepers Creepers," "Powder" and even "Rites of Passage" that are more startling than anything here.) He is definitely a talent, though I completely understand why people would think he doesn't deserve to work ever again.

    An exploitation Oscar and Felix casts Eric Roberts as Adrian, a dirty piece of human driftwood hitchhiking the lonesome desert highway where, in random stopovers, people are being massacred by a phantom calling himself THE HATCHET MAN. Also, a local bank was robbed of a million bucks and uptight traveling salesman Jack, played by a subdued Lance Henriksen, reluctantly gives Adrian rides throughout the scorched purgatory. Jack, a dreary victim of Adrian's cocky pontifications of sex, violence and drugs, has a constant expression of a guy who has yet to drink his morning cup of coffee; while Adrian seems like he just bench-pressed a piano while chain-smoking cigarettes on crystal meth. Their best moments are hanging out at a dirty spoon diner or joining up with a free-spirited hippie couple living out of a van. Thus the mystery unravels and two important questions surface: When will the Hatchet Man, who seems to be Adrian, strike again? And will Jack, carrying around his metallic briefcase with not-so-mysterious contents inside, be an eventual victim? With a David Lynch vibe sans the distracting weirdness, THE NATURE OF THE BEAST... where the spooky desert becomes an ominous character in itself... is an entertaining vehicle for two actors usually cast in the predator role: that aspect alone makes the film's conclusion both pleasantly surprising and utterly predictable.

    Well, why all those movies earned higher grade, deserve that. What is so difference in between this and them? There is no much difference. So why such a low grade. I agree with someone said if there was some other, let's call them "better" actors, this movie would have better grade. In my opinion, this move has all what good movie must have: thrill packed, atmosphere,background sound, photography is well done, actor's performances is almost excellent. Maybe Lance's is slightly lower than Eric's performance, but both were great. Really, it deserve 9 grade. One of the the masterpiece. Too bad that critics didn't pay much attention for this work of art.

    What could possibly be more fun and intriguing? An obscure serial killer flick starring the great Lance Henrickson and Eric Roberts as his nemesis with veteran B-movie actor Brion James as an unbeknown sheriff. All this rolled into a twisted cat and mouse game that keeps the audience guessing to the end. The mid-nineties was a time where horror movies took a dive from the 80's VHS Video rental craze to the point where b-horror comedies and thrillers would become few and far between. Right before the DVD revolution would eventually shine its face on the world, there were still some unappreciated genre films festering in the minds of talented film makers, and daring studios that help them pull it off. The VHS world was not quite defeated yet, and "Nature of the Beast" was one of those 1990's horror-thrillers that quickly hit VHS and pay cable networks after the success of "Silence of The Lambs". This has all the elements of a good cat and mouse thriller. All you have to know is that Lance Henrickson (at his best) is a traveling salesman with a secret, Eric Roberts is the lone drifter that he picks up, and lots of people are getting hacked up by a serial killer called "Hatchet Man" everywhere they seem to go. Of course, the two seem like opposite personalities butting heads constantly until one or the other gets the upper hand. A solid script handled well by a perfect cast thats experienced with this kind of genre. Each contributing to the suspense until the audience can only guess who the killer is. The isolation of the desert landscape creates tremendous tension, and the surprises are abound. This is finely crafted stuff by Victor Salva who's "Jeepers Creepers" fails miserably in comparison. Be prepared for a whopper of an ending too.

    I can't believe this movie is SOO underrated ! It's a fantastic thriller and FULL of suspense ! It has great performances from Lance Henriksen and a young Eric Roberts. They are both fantastic in this movie, and they both play two great, great characters and they are the perfect casts for the roles because their look fits the characters perfectly. The ending is so well written! I can't believe that this movie so incredibly underrated and no one talks or reviews it. It's a masterpiece and one of my all time favorites. 10/10

    "Eric Roberts and Lance Henriksen star in this intense psychological thriller about a businessman drawn into a bloody game of cat and mouse by a mysterious drifter. With the police searching for a serial killer on a murderous rampage, and a million dollars missing from a Las Vegas casino, both men have something sinister to hide. But as the lies are peeled away and their true nature is revealed, it becomes clear that one of them is a madman. The question is which oneÂ…" asks the DVD sleeve description. Writer/director Victor Salva makes it like a psycho on wheels, with plenty of gay subtext. Picture "The Hitcher" with both driver and passenger playing psychopaths. Devilishly charismatic Mr. Roberts (as Adrian) was born to play this role, and a psychologically bent Mr. Henriksen (as Jack) matches him at most every turn. The production is inexpensive but effective; it keeps you either interested or riveted, but fails, in the end, to tie its interesting threads together. And, Henriksen's girth was unnecessary. ******* The Nature of the Beast (10/24/95) Victor Salva ~ Lance Henriksen, Eric Roberts, Brion James, Sasha Jenson

    The uneasy understanding between Jack and Adrian thoroughly involves the viewer, and progresses towards an exciting and unexpected conclusion. I purposely watched "Nature of the Beast" twice just to be certain the ending holds up to logic, and it certainly does. This second viewing was just as enjoyable, though somewhat different than the first, because I was watching from a new perspective. I give the movie a ten rating only to help raise the unbelievably low IMDb rating, although it is a solid 8.0 under any circumstances. The acting, character development, locations, music, are all great, and this is a true "sleeper" that will leave your friends who view it astonished. - MERK

    I like movies in which I don't know what's happening until the end. This is one of them. Very underrated, something like "Secret Window" with Johnny Depp. Story is good and it's about Jack who's driving through Nevada and soon he picks Adrian, a mysterious man who don't want to go away from him even when Jack is trying to lose him. This story will keep you tense right till' the end. Only two important characters are Jack and Adrian and they are played by Lance Henriksen and Eric Roberts. Both of them are superb in their roles and they are keeping this movie interesting to watch. I would like to congratulate Mr.Roberts on this role because this is one of his greatest performances.Good plot and excellent actors are here, so all you need to do is watch this movie. You won't regret. I didn't.

    When I started watching this movie, I never expected the incredible gem it turned out to be. I've always felt that Lance Henriksen is one of our best character actors, and that Eric Roberts is underrated (though the fact that he seems to take any part, any time, may contribute to that). What I didn't expect was two absolutely amazing performances, and the incredible nuance of character that each actor brings to this movie. Henriksen (playing against type) shows great vulnerability as the lonely sales rep on the road, and Roberts keeps you guessing the whole movie as his charming personality belies his apparent menace. I mean, this guy was making me feel uncomfortable, and I was safe on my couch!! I have enthusiastically recommended this movie to many, many movie buffs. The directing is excellent, the tension palpable, and the plotting is well done. This two character, cat and mouse tale ranks right up there with "Sleuth" in my personal video library. While Henriksen and Roberts will never be mistaken for Olivier and Caine, let's give credit where credit is due. These two guys stepped up to the plate and knocked it out of the ballpark on this one.

    I've seen enough movies to know this genre, and this movie reminded me a lot of the movie "Switchback" with Danny Glover. Its the same old crazy hitchhiker type theme, but with some differences added. Lance and Eric are both amazing actors, and you have to give them props for their work here too. They are believable in their roles, and keep character the entire movie. Their scenes together were tensed and uncomfortable but that was exactly how it should have gone. I applaud them both. The movie was a bit on the slower side, because of its mystery nature, and really its more about situational tension than anything else. Still, I kept watching so I was interested enough to see what happens and the actors were a big part of that. I agree with the guy above me in that the ending was a bit on the disappointing side. The twists still got me good actually, and I was OK with them, but I agree they were forced and probably should have been smoothed over better by redoing the last 15 minutes or so. Its one of those movies where they just sorta end and you like "What!" So as I said, worth watching, but because of a little forced direction could have been better.

    Well, why all those movies earned higher grade, deserve that. What is so difference in between this and them? There is no much difference. So why such a low grade. I agree with someone said if there was some other, let's call them "better" actors, this movie would have better grade. In my opinion, this move has all what good movie must have: thrill packed, atmosphere,background sound, photography is well done, actor's performances is almost excellent. Maybe Lance's is slightly lower than Eric's performance, but both were great. Really, it deserve 9 grade. One of the the masterpiece. Too bad that critics didn't pay much attention for this work of art.

    What could possibly be more fun and intriguing? An obscure serial killer flick starring the great Lance Henrickson and Eric Roberts as his nemesis with veteran B-movie actor Brion James as an unbeknown sheriff. All this rolled into a twisted cat and mouse game that keeps the audience guessing to the end. The mid-nineties was a time where horror movies took a dive from the 80's VHS Video rental craze to the point where b-horror comedies and thrillers would become few and far between. Right before the DVD revolution would eventually shine its face on the world, there were still some unappreciated genre films festering in the minds of talented film makers, and daring studios that help them pull it off. The VHS world was not quite defeated yet, and "Nature of the Beast" was one of those 1990's horror-thrillers that quickly hit VHS and pay cable networks after the success of "Silence of The Lambs". This has all the elements of a good cat and mouse thriller. All you have to know is that Lance Henrickson (at his best) is a traveling salesman with a secret, Eric Roberts is the lone drifter that he picks up, and lots of people are getting hacked up by a serial killer called "Hatchet Man" everywhere they seem to go. Of course, the two seem like opposite personalities butting heads constantly until one or the other gets the upper hand. A solid script handled well by a perfect cast thats experienced with this kind of genre. Each contributing to the suspense until the audience can only guess who the killer is. The isolation of the desert landscape creates tremendous tension, and the surprises are abound. This is finely crafted stuff by Victor Salva who's "Jeepers Creepers" fails miserably in comparison. Be prepared for a whopper of an ending too.

    I can't believe this movie is SOO underrated ! It's a fantastic thriller and FULL of suspense ! It has great performances from Lance Henriksen and a young Eric Roberts. They are both fantastic in this movie, and they both play two great, great characters and they are the perfect casts for the roles because their look fits the characters perfectly. The ending is so well written! I can't believe that this movie so incredibly underrated and no one talks or reviews it. It's a masterpiece and one of my all time favorites. 10/10

    "Eric Roberts and Lance Henriksen star in this intense psychological thriller about a businessman drawn into a bloody game of cat and mouse by a mysterious drifter. With the police searching for a serial killer on a murderous rampage, and a million dollars missing from a Las Vegas casino, both men have something sinister to hide. But as the lies are peeled away and their true nature is revealed, it becomes clear that one of them is a madman. The question is which oneÂ…" asks the DVD sleeve description. Writer/director Victor Salva makes it like a psycho on wheels, with plenty of gay subtext. Picture "The Hitcher" with both driver and passenger playing psychopaths. Devilishly charismatic Mr. Roberts (as Adrian) was born to play this role, and a psychologically bent Mr. Henriksen (as Jack) matches him at most every turn. The production is inexpensive but effective; it keeps you either interested or riveted, but fails, in the end, to tie its interesting threads together. And, Henriksen's girth was unnecessary. ******* The Nature of the Beast (10/24/95) Victor Salva ~ Lance Henriksen, Eric Roberts, Brion James, Sasha Jenson

    The uneasy understanding between Jack and Adrian thoroughly involves the viewer, and progresses towards an exciting and unexpected conclusion. I purposely watched "Nature of the Beast" twice just to be certain the ending holds up to logic, and it certainly does. This second viewing was just as enjoyable, though somewhat different than the first, because I was watching from a new perspective. I give the movie a ten rating only to help raise the unbelievably low IMDb rating, although it is a solid 8.0 under any circumstances. The acting, character development, locations, music, are all great, and this is a true "sleeper" that will leave your friends who view it astonished. - MERK

    I like movies in which I don't know what's happening until the end. This is one of them. Very underrated, something like "Secret Window" with Johnny Depp. Story is good and it's about Jack who's driving through Nevada and soon he picks Adrian, a mysterious man who don't want to go away from him even when Jack is trying to lose him. This story will keep you tense right till' the end. Only two important characters are Jack and Adrian and they are played by Lance Henriksen and Eric Roberts. Both of them are superb in their roles and they are keeping this movie interesting to watch. I would like to congratulate Mr.Roberts on this role because this is one of his greatest performances.Good plot and excellent actors are here, so all you need to do is watch this movie. You won't regret. I didn't.

    When I started watching this movie, I never expected the incredible gem it turned out to be. I've always felt that Lance Henriksen is one of our best character actors, and that Eric Roberts is underrated (though the fact that he seems to take any part, any time, may contribute to that). What I didn't expect was two absolutely amazing performances, and the incredible nuance of character that each actor brings to this movie. Henriksen (playing against type) shows great vulnerability as the lonely sales rep on the road, and Roberts keeps you guessing the whole movie as his charming personality belies his apparent menace. I mean, this guy was making me feel uncomfortable, and I was safe on my couch!! I have enthusiastically recommended this movie to many, many movie buffs. The directing is excellent, the tension palpable, and the plotting is well done. This two character, cat and mouse tale ranks right up there with "Sleuth" in my personal video library. While Henriksen and Roberts will never be mistaken for Olivier and Caine, let's give credit where credit is due. These two guys stepped up to the plate and knocked it out of the ballpark on this one.

    I've seen enough movies to know this genre, and this movie reminded me a lot of the movie "Switchback" with Danny Glover. Its the same old crazy hitchhiker type theme, but with some differences added. Lance and Eric are both amazing actors, and you have to give them props for their work here too. They are believable in their roles, and keep character the entire movie. Their scenes together were tensed and uncomfortable but that was exactly how it should have gone. I applaud them both. The movie was a bit on the slower side, because of its mystery nature, and really its more about situational tension than anything else. Still, I kept watching so I was interested enough to see what happens and the actors were a big part of that. I agree with the guy above me in that the ending was a bit on the disappointing side. The twists still got me good actually, and I was OK with them, but I agree they were forced and probably should have been smoothed over better by redoing the last 15 minutes or so. Its one of those movies where they just sorta end and you like "What!" So as I said, worth watching, but because of a little forced direction could have been better.

    This even more perversely homoerotic spin on "The Hitcher" has Lance Hendricksen (with a somewhat unconvincing bulge of padded gut) as a respectable-looking businessman embezzler of 1 1/2 million bucks. On the lam, he unfortunately crosses paths with creepy, insinuating drifter Eric Roberts--the "Hatchet Man" of recent serial dismembering killings. The tension between them is nicely maintained--with very little graphic on screen violence--though it dissipates somewhat as the progress goes on. The big final twist works, though it won't come as a complete surprise to veteran viewers of psychothrillers. Roberts and Hendricksen are excellent, the support parts (most of them murder victims) are nicely played. This isn't the most intense of pederasty-disgraced writer-director Victor Salva's features, but it's intense enough, albeit falling short of the full payoff one expects. (There are scenes in "Jeepers Creepers," "Powder" and even "Rites of Passage" that are more startling than anything here.) He is definitely a talent, though I completely understand why people would think he doesn't deserve to work ever again.

    An exploitation Oscar and Felix casts Eric Roberts as Adrian, a dirty piece of human driftwood hitchhiking the lonesome desert highway where, in random stopovers, people are being massacred by a phantom calling himself THE HATCHET MAN. Also, a local bank was robbed of a million bucks and uptight traveling salesman Jack, played by a subdued Lance Henriksen, reluctantly gives Adrian rides throughout the scorched purgatory. Jack, a dreary victim of Adrian's cocky pontifications of sex, violence and drugs, has a constant expression of a guy who has yet to drink his morning cup of coffee; while Adrian seems like he just bench-pressed a piano while chain-smoking cigarettes on crystal meth. Their best moments are hanging out at a dirty spoon diner or joining up with a free-spirited hippie couple living out of a van. Thus the mystery unravels and two important questions surface: When will the Hatchet Man, who seems to be Adrian, strike again? And will Jack, carrying around his metallic briefcase with not-so-mysterious contents inside, be an eventual victim? With a David Lynch vibe sans the distracting weirdness, THE NATURE OF THE BEAST... where the spooky desert becomes an ominous character in itself... is an entertaining vehicle for two actors usually cast in the predator role: that aspect alone makes the film's conclusion both pleasantly surprising and utterly predictable.
