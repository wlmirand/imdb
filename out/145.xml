    THE LAWNMOWER MAN, a virtual reality-based sci-fi thriller supposedly based on a short story by Stephen King (although in reality it has nothing to do with it) is the perfect definition of a dated film. The entire premise of the film is reliant on then-cutting edge technology involving computer generated characters and VR, and of course today it looks laughable. JURASSIC PARK came out a year later and also dealt with cutting edge technology yet it hasn't dated at all, so I guess the difference is down to the budget. This is one of those films that's mildly entertaining in places and that's about it. It's a passable slice of entertainment, neither particularly good nor particularly bad, instead occupying a place in the middle of the road as with so many films. It has its good points, and the best of those is the consistently underrated Jeff Fahey, a man who's spent his life enhancing B-movies with many a decent performance. The narrative is about a simpleton who gradually transforms into a genius, and the journey there is fairly interesting, enlivened by a quirky turn from Jenny Wright as a love interest. But Pierce Brosnan's scientist lead is a bit of a bore and Brosnan gives one of those diffident performances that blight his career. Not to mention that Geoffrey Lewis is wasted while Austin O'Brien (the kid from LAST ACTION HERO) gets way too much screen time. By the end, of course, it all becomes rather overblown and over the top, complete with maniacal villainy and pyrotechnic effects. B-movie director Brett Leonard also handled two films I hated (HIDEAWAY and HIGHLANDER: THE SOURCE), along with a movie I was indifferent to (VIRTUOSITY) and I'm in the latter camp with THE LAWNMOWER MAN; it's one of those films that deserves to be forgotten except by the most dedicated sci-fi fans.

He puts the gardener on an extensive schedule of learning, and quickly he becomes brilliant. But at this point the gardener has a few ideas of his own on how the research should continue, and the scientist begins losing control of his experiments..... 1992, when this film was released, I remember the posters saying, Better effects than Terminator 2. As a fourteen year old, it sold me, I went to see it and remember the VR scenes, nothing else. Now, being a little more wiser to movie quotes, that poster quote was put there because obviously at the time, no one had anything good to say about it. and this was quite a big release back in 1992. 21 years later, and the film hasn't aged well, frankly it looks awful, and those groovy effects I saw when VR was a big thing, look terrible. As for the plot and narrative, it's basically Fahey combing his hair and dressing like Eastwood in his movies with Clyde, and Brosnan holding his head and shaking, and smoking in bed. Some say the directors cut makes it more worthwhile, filling in important plot holes, believe me it doesn't, it makes the film more of an ordeal. But it's still watchable in the car crash sense of the word. it's an unmitigated disaster, but there are a few funny scenes. But it really hasn't held up well.

    Some movies stay with us forever, being revolutionary and genuinely original. An unnaturally low (well, average) rating of this movie is extraordinary. Instead of rubbing shoulders with "Blade Runner" and "The Matrix" on the top 250 list, it finds its place in a line of average "blockheadbuster" flicks. Perhaps, this situation is a result of "Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond ... something" release. They should have created a low-end "Blade Runner 2" back in 1980s or 1990s to even the chances. For me it is difficult to find any drawbacks in this sci-fi. The whole screen presentation is a cyber kick in the brains (do we actually need all this scientific progress that pushes Man closer and closer to the edge?) and in the ass (the final scene is far from being a happy ending and the CGI talk between the scientist and his creation is still spooky even now). The movie is complete and locked in itself. The final scene with phones ringing all over the world makes one point perfectly clear: the evil has leaked through. Of course, by today's standards the computer-generated sequences, especially in the beginning of the movie, are not impressive, but the ones shown in the end are really memorable and all the way freaky. And don't make the mistake once made by me: never watch the "Lawnmower Man 2" abomination. It is like reading "Hamlet 2" by some "Shakespoore". To crown it all, it has all the guts and style to find its place in the row of such clever sci-fi flicks as "Solyaris" (1972), "Blade Runner" (1982), "Alien" (1979), and "The Terminator" (1984). It will be very interesting to know the evaluation of these original sci-fi movies in a hundred years. Will try to check it out on IMDb then, if given a chance of course. And a tough 10 goes toÂ… "The Lawnmower Man" (1992)! Thanks for attention.

    This film....there are no words that give it justice. I didn't get it at first but after a friend commented on it my mind was blown. A man who mows lawns for a living, tries to use computers to turn himself into a lawnmower, but in the end, it turns out he was a lawnmower all along...because he MOWS LAWNS! My god, i couldn't believe such a fantastic plot with those kind of deep sub plots could be done on this kind of budget, but Brett Leonard made it happen, we salute you. o\ Of course lets not forget Steven King, without his ingeniousness this would not have been written to such a high caliber. These men, they need more recognition for what they gave to people growing up in the 90's, this let us know what we could aspire too, and that in the end, we learned that it was inside us all along.

    This movie is just one purely awesome movie. From the cuts one would expect a movie that is simply showing off virtual reality, but it is much more than that. Sure enough, there are some brilliant virtual reality scenes, and it does explain things about it, but the explanation moves from a simple advertisement to the extent of the possible abuse of the technology. Lawnmowerman is not a science-fiction movie, it is a horror movie. When I say horror movie, it is not horrible monsters chasing maidens everywhere and ripping people to shreds, rather it stretches reality to a point where we can see a possibility in what is being portrayed in the movie as actually happening. On the cover, the credits say "based on a short story by Stephen King." There are aspects of Stephen King in this movie, such as The Shop, which is a government research facility devoted to the development of almost occult powers with the purpose of waging war, but Stephen King did not give permission to make this movie, and when he sued the makers of the movie, they were forced to remove him from the credits. This movie looks at man's basic obsession with power. Doctor Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is really a naive scientist who has a romantic view of science. His romantic discoveries are corrupted by the Shop's desire to see how far they push the experiments in the development of a weapon of war. Angelo wants to create something that will aid humanity, but unfortunately he must go to the Shop as they are the only ones who have the facilities, but with their facilities comes the pressure to develop something they can use. Their interests are not in helping people, but in destroying people. There are two sides to everything in this movie. On the simple level there is Father Macay, who is a kind priest that took Jobe in when he was young and abandoned. On the other side he is tyrant side, using his good deeds to enslave Jobe. Jobe's simpleness creates a dichotomy, as on one hand he is innocent and friendly, where as on the other hand he is ridiculed and easily manipulated. Doctor Angelo is a brilliant scientist who is working at the cutting edge of computer science, where as he is a man who is obsessed with his work to the point that he drives away his wife. The project is what reveals the greatest dichotomy. This is a breakthrough in regards to healing the retarded. People that were once ridiculed because of their backwardness can now live among normal human society. When we look deeper we notice that Doctor Angelo really does not know what he is doing. He thinks he is helping Jobe but we notice that things are changing about him. Not only is he becoming like everybody else, but he is developing extra abilities. When Jobe is first operated on, we see symbols flashing at him. These symbols appear to be related to sorcery which suggests not only that Doctor Angelo is working with things he does not understand, it also raises the possibility of an evil, uncontrollable side to it. The uncontrollable side comes out when the project 5 formula is used on Jobe. This formula is supposed to be the formula used to reach the maximum mental capacity. It had been used of chimps with surprising results, but also there was another side to it. Where as it advanced the chimps mentally, it also made them more aggressive. The same is with Jobe. We see that he advances to an extraordinary stage, he is almost a god, but he also becomes incredibly aggressive, almost inhuman. Even though, there is still a very human aspect to him. When he confronts his enemies, father Macay and Jake, he gives them a chance to repent; when they do not then they are dealt with. He does not let on that he is incredibly powerful, but once they realise it, it is too late. When Peter is trapped in VSI, Jobe cannot allow him to die. He has a choice between trying to escape the mainframe, or letting Doctor Angelo rescue him. The pain of the choice, and the humanity that still does remain within him is represented by his icon becoming flesh. An interesting event in the movie is with father Macay. Though he is a minor character, his character is developed well. He is portrayed as the typical hypocritical catholic priest. His quote "how can we let these godless creatures on the sacred altar" really outline his ignorance, especially how God created the ants. His comment on the sacred altar is meaningless because all it really is is a piece of wood with a piece of cloth on it. The sacred altar is an old testament concept, whereas Jesus' death wash all of this away. The book of Hebrews clearly outlines how these rites are no longer necessary. His ignorance is even more clearly seen when he says, "and he will bring the wrath of God upon him just like his namesake." All I can say to Father Macay, open your bible and read it. God was not angry with Job and did not punish him. Rather it is more about suffering. The bible is very clear that Job was a righteous man and that God was not punishing him. We also see the results of this ignorance when Jobe is doing his penance. He quickly finishes it off and immediately turns away from God and worships the lawnmower. This looks stupid, but it is something that really happens. The hypocrisy of many Christians drive people away from God and to other, stupid, idols, such as football. The Lawnmowerman is an awesome movie, one that I have bought, and will watch again. I love this movie and would highly recommend it to others.

    The Lawnmower Man The best thing about lawn maintenance is that you can make some extra cash selling grass clippings to stupid teenagers. However, the groundskeeper in this thriller is too thickheaded to figure that out. One day, while mowing the lawn, dimwitted Jobe (Jeff Fahey) is invited in to his client's, Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan), home to play virtual reality games. During his time with Jobe, Angelo determines that he would make an excellent lab rat for a new drug that promises to stimulate brain function. With his acumen amplified to the point of telekinesis, Jobe uses his newly minted mind powers to settle scores with those who exploited him when he was obtuse. Bearing little resemble to the Stephen King short story on which it is based, instead, The Lawnmower Man uses name recognition to capitalize off the 1990s virtual reality craze. Besides, everyone knows mixing drugs and video games only leads to obesity. (Red Light)

    The first half of this science fiction horror tale (based on a short story from Stephen King's Night Shift Collection) is thought provoking and gripping, but the latter half decides to dive deep into an eccentric and confusing mix of special effects and pseudo-scientific mayhem. Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is a brilliant but obsessed computer science specialist that is engaged in secret government experiments to create super-intelligent soldiers out of chimpanzees by using virtual reality simulations to stimulate the brain. When the experiment goes haywire, and a rogue chimp gets away, Angelo believes his destiny is to better mankind by using a human subject for his projects for the purpose of curing brain diseases and not warfare. His subject is Jobe, (played perfectly by Jeff Fahey) the half-wit lawnmower man that lives in the shed of a church next door. As Dr. Angelo's experiments progress, Jobe becomes an intelligent super-human genius whose powers eventually spiral out of control. This film is triumphant on many various levels. Films dealing with a gradual transformation/disintegration of a central character are very intriguing to watch, and this is very much "Cronenbergian" in its portrayal of Jobe and how he develops into a telekinetic mad genius from a complete idiot and ultimately becomes a tragically vengeful and emotionless entity. The themes dealing with the unlocking of the human primordial intellect and controlling its power by wisdom and not impatient force work wonderfully. The performances are superb as well as the animation sequences, and director Brett Leonard (Virtuosity) is good at integrating them into a live action film. There are many sinister government character types that add suspense to the plot, and Jenny Wright is great as the sexy seductress neighbor who has her way with Jobe. The only time this fails is when Jobe gets revenge on the government goons and the characters that antagonized him by merging his powers with the world of virtual reality resulting in some far out murder sequences that just don't seem to make any sense. Jobe eventually infuses himself with the computer mainframe, and the climax becomes a bit too bizarre, even for sci-fi computer geek fans. Nonetheless, this is a well-made, above-average assault on the senses. If you can find the VHS unrated director's cut, it is much better than the DVD release which is cut by almost twenty minutes, losing most of its character development and style. This is highly recommended for fans of mind-bending sci-fi/horror.

    This effect-laden sci-fi horror film looked pretty impressive back in 1992. But of course times move on, and such movies have a tendency to look dated quicker than most as technology marches on to new levels. I guess The Lawnmower Man is one of these films. But in fairness, it can be quite fun to look back at old special effects and see what was cutting edge back in the day. In truth, today if you were to give a 12 year old child a computer game with graphics similar to those in The Lawnmower Man, that child would turn around and laugh in your face. Such is the speed of computer technology. So yes, The Lawnmower Man no longer looks cutting-edge but neither does it look terrible, its effects work within themselves and are only occasionally atrocious, such as the burning priest. As most people already know, the story is about a simpleton who is turned into a genius via virtual reality technology. The side effect of this method is that it turns the, otherwise good natured man into an insane evil psychotic. The Lawnmower Man is neither a particularly good film, nor an especially bad one. There's certainly nothing special here, and the effects were by far its chief selling point. Without them this would almost certainly be a forgotten B-movie. Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey are reasonable enough in their roles, but they were always going to play second fiddle to the CGI. At the heart of it all it's a simple clich&eacute;d story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way.

    Pierce Brosnan plays a scientist whose virtual reality experiments on a chimp have gone wrong. The chimp got smarter, and had to be killed after it snatched a gun from a security guard and went on a rampage (in the hilarious opening sequence). He feels like the chimp, with its natural penchant for animalistic violence, was probably not as good an experimental subject as a person would be. Yeah, sounds like a bad idea, but he goes forward with it with the participation of his retarded lawn mowing guy, Jeff Fahey. So, yeah, Fahey eventually gets smarter and, for no particular reason, starts to use his superior powers (he becomes telepathic and telekinetic), as well as his Tron-like tracksuit, for evil. This could have been corny fun (and, honestly, at its best, it is), but between the horribly dated CGI and the far too slow pace, it's a dud. The only really good thing about it is Fahey's performance. I do love his rampage, though, where he attacks people telekinetically with his lawnmower.

    If one can look past the visual-technology used to imply effects one can be pleasantly surprised as they find themselves questioning her sympathies for other people. This movie is a product of the 90s, and as such, may not be for all people. The idea of a full-grown man befriending a small boy might seem startling to us now, but in the 90s it was rather common (if I'm remembering this correctly). Billy Bob Thornton does a spectacular job playing a "mentally challenged" man in a small town where he is misunderstood...only a child can understand him. When given the chance to help his friend, we find ourselves questioning our sympathies for other people. Even though, due to certain physical conditions I currently find myself in, I usually feel sympathetic to people who face any kind of diversity, I do not know if I can fully agree with the path that Billy's character takes. ***SPOILER ALERT***MURDERING IS WRONG IN MOST INSTANCES BUT IT IS WRONG IN THIS INSTANCE? I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY!***END SPOILER ALERT*** And I don't believe that anyone is at liberty to say. It is not a question that can be so easily answered by our text books or our knowledge; One must contemplate the answer and decide for their own self (that is exactly what one must do, hopefully as soon as possible we should all do that). Somethings are just deeper than what is found in books. The movie feels very realistic. VERY sober. This movie wasn't made in the Hollywood spirit I have come to despise, but in a different spirit full of intellectual rigor. Though there is a child in this movie, I would not recommend this movie for children, at the end **SPOILER ALERT**Billy Bob Thornton's character murders someone**END SPOILER ALERT** And most people don't like their children watching that. The title of the film sounds simple (it's just an object!) and the character seem simple, but it is a very complicated movie. I hesitantly recommend.

There are aspects of Stephen King in this movie, such as The Shop, which is a government research facility devoted to the development of almost occult powers with the purpose of waging war, but Stephen King did not give permission to make this movie, and when he sued the makers of the movie, they were forced to remove him from the credits. This movie looks at man's basic obsession with power. Doctor Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is really a naive scientist who has a romantic view of science. His romantic discoveries are corrupted by the Shop's desire to see how far they push the experiments in the development of a weapon of war. Angelo wants to create something that will aid humanity, but unfortunately he must go to the Shop as they are the only ones who have the facilities, but with their facilities comes the pressure to develop something they can use. Their interests are not in helping people, but in destroying people. There are two sides to everything in this movie. On the simple level there is Father Macay, who is a kind priest that took Jobe in when he was young and abandoned. On the other side he is tyrant side, using his good deeds to enslave Jobe. Jobe's simpleness creates a dichotomy, as on one hand he is innocent and friendly, where as on the other hand he is ridiculed and easily manipulated. Doctor Angelo is a brilliant scientist who is working at the cutting edge of computer science, where as he is a man who is obsessed with his work to the point that he drives away his wife. The project is what reveals the greatest dichotomy. This is a breakthrough in regards to healing the retarded. People that were once ridiculed because of their backwardness can now live among normal human society. When we look deeper we notice that Doctor Angelo really does not know what he is doing. He thinks he is helping Jobe but we notice that things are changing about him. Not only is he becoming like everybody else, but he is developing extra abilities. When Jobe is first operated on, we see symbols flashing at him. These symbols appear to be related to sorcery which suggests not only that Doctor Angelo is working with things he does not understand, it also raises the possibility of an evil, uncontrollable side to it. The uncontrollable side comes out when the project 5 formula is used on Jobe. This formula is supposed to be the formula used to reach the maximum mental capacity. It had been used of chimps with surprising results, but also there was another side to it. Where as it advanced the chimps mentally, it also made them more aggressive. The same is with Jobe. We see that he advances to an extraordinary stage, he is almost a god, but he also becomes incredibly aggressive, almost inhuman. Even though, there is still a very human aspect to him. When he confronts his enemies, father Macay and Jake, he gives them a chance to repent; when they do not then they are dealt with. He does not let on that he is incredibly powerful, but once they realise it, it is too late. When Peter is trapped in VSI, Jobe cannot allow him to die. He has a choice between trying to escape the mainframe, or letting Doctor Angelo rescue him. The pain of the choice, and the humanity that still does remain within him is represented by his icon becoming flesh. An interesting event in the movie is with father Macay. Though he is a minor character, his character is developed well. He is portrayed as the typical hypocritical catholic priest. His quote "how can we let these godless creatures on the sacred altar" really outline his ignorance, especially how God created the ants. His comment on the sacred altar is meaningless because all it really is is a piece of wood with a piece of cloth on it. The sacred altar is an old testament concept, whereas Jesus' death wash all of this away. The book of Hebrews clearly outlines how these rites are no longer necessary. His ignorance is even more clearly seen when he says, "and he will bring the wrath of God upon him just like his namesake." All I can say to Father Macay, open your bible and read it. God was not angry with Job and did not punish him. Rather it is more about suffering. The bible is very clear that Job was a righteous man and that God was not punishing him. We also see the results of this ignorance when Jobe is doing his penance. He quickly finishes it off and immediately turns away from God and worships the lawnmower. This looks stupid, but it is something that really happens. The hypocrisy of many Christians drive people away from God and to other, stupid, idols, such as football. The Lawnmowerman is an awesome movie, one that I have bought, and will watch again. I love this movie and would highly recommend it to others.

    The Lawnmower Man The best thing about lawn maintenance is that you can make some extra cash selling grass clippings to stupid teenagers. However, the groundskeeper in this thriller is too thickheaded to figure that out. One day, while mowing the lawn, dimwitted Jobe (Jeff Fahey) is invited in to his client's, Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan), home to play virtual reality games. During his time with Jobe, Angelo determines that he would make an excellent lab rat for a new drug that promises to stimulate brain function. With his acumen amplified to the point of telekinesis, Jobe uses his newly minted mind powers to settle scores with those who exploited him when he was obtuse. Bearing little resemble to the Stephen King short story on which it is based, instead, The Lawnmower Man uses name recognition to capitalize off the 1990s virtual reality craze. Besides, everyone knows mixing drugs and video games only leads to obesity. (Red Light)

    The first half of this science fiction horror tale (based on a short story from Stephen King's Night Shift Collection) is thought provoking and gripping, but the latter half decides to dive deep into an eccentric and confusing mix of special effects and pseudo-scientific mayhem. Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is a brilliant but obsessed computer science specialist that is engaged in secret government experiments to create super-intelligent soldiers out of chimpanzees by using virtual reality simulations to stimulate the brain. When the experiment goes haywire, and a rogue chimp gets away, Angelo believes his destiny is to better mankind by using a human subject for his projects for the purpose of curing brain diseases and not warfare. His subject is Jobe, (played perfectly by Jeff Fahey) the half-wit lawnmower man that lives in the shed of a church next door. As Dr. Angelo's experiments progress, Jobe becomes an intelligent super-human genius whose powers eventually spiral out of control. This film is triumphant on many various levels. Films dealing with a gradual transformation/disintegration of a central character are very intriguing to watch, and this is very much "Cronenbergian" in its portrayal of Jobe and how he develops into a telekinetic mad genius from a complete idiot and ultimately becomes a tragically vengeful and emotionless entity. The themes dealing with the unlocking of the human primordial intellect and controlling its power by wisdom and not impatient force work wonderfully. The performances are superb as well as the animation sequences, and director Brett Leonard (Virtuosity) is good at integrating them into a live action film. There are many sinister government character types that add suspense to the plot, and Jenny Wright is great as the sexy seductress neighbor who has her way with Jobe. The only time this fails is when Jobe gets revenge on the government goons and the characters that antagonized him by merging his powers with the world of virtual reality resulting in some far out murder sequences that just don't seem to make any sense. Jobe eventually infuses himself with the computer mainframe, and the climax becomes a bit too bizarre, even for sci-fi computer geek fans. Nonetheless, this is a well-made, above-average assault on the senses. If you can find the VHS unrated director's cut, it is much better than the DVD release which is cut by almost twenty minutes, losing most of its character development and style. This is highly recommended for fans of mind-bending sci-fi/horror.

    This effect-laden sci-fi horror film looked pretty impressive back in 1992. But of course times move on, and such movies have a tendency to look dated quicker than most as technology marches on to new levels. I guess The Lawnmower Man is one of these films. But in fairness, it can be quite fun to look back at old special effects and see what was cutting edge back in the day. In truth, today if you were to give a 12 year old child a computer game with graphics similar to those in The Lawnmower Man, that child would turn around and laugh in your face. Such is the speed of computer technology. So yes, The Lawnmower Man no longer looks cutting-edge but neither does it look terrible, its effects work within themselves and are only occasionally atrocious, such as the burning priest. As most people already know, the story is about a simpleton who is turned into a genius via virtual reality technology. The side effect of this method is that it turns the, otherwise good natured man into an insane evil psychotic. The Lawnmower Man is neither a particularly good film, nor an especially bad one. There's certainly nothing special here, and the effects were by far its chief selling point. Without them this would almost certainly be a forgotten B-movie. Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey are reasonable enough in their roles, but they were always going to play second fiddle to the CGI. At the heart of it all it's a simple clich&eacute;d story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way.

    Pierce Brosnan plays a scientist whose virtual reality experiments on a chimp have gone wrong. The chimp got smarter, and had to be killed after it snatched a gun from a security guard and went on a rampage (in the hilarious opening sequence). He feels like the chimp, with its natural penchant for animalistic violence, was probably not as good an experimental subject as a person would be. Yeah, sounds like a bad idea, but he goes forward with it with the participation of his retarded lawn mowing guy, Jeff Fahey. So, yeah, Fahey eventually gets smarter and, for no particular reason, starts to use his superior powers (he becomes telepathic and telekinetic), as well as his Tron-like tracksuit, for evil. This could have been corny fun (and, honestly, at its best, it is), but between the horribly dated CGI and the far too slow pace, it's a dud. The only really good thing about it is Fahey's performance. I do love his rampage, though, where he attacks people telekinetically with his lawnmower.

    If one can look past the visual-technology used to imply effects one can be pleasantly surprised as they find themselves questioning her sympathies for other people. This movie is a product of the 90s, and as such, may not be for all people. The idea of a full-grown man befriending a small boy might seem startling to us now, but in the 90s it was rather common (if I'm remembering this correctly). Billy Bob Thornton does a spectacular job playing a "mentally challenged" man in a small town where he is misunderstood...only a child can understand him. When given the chance to help his friend, we find ourselves questioning our sympathies for other people. Even though, due to certain physical conditions I currently find myself in, I usually feel sympathetic to people who face any kind of diversity, I do not know if I can fully agree with the path that Billy's character takes. ***SPOILER ALERT***MURDERING IS WRONG IN MOST INSTANCES BUT IT IS WRONG IN THIS INSTANCE? I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY!***END SPOILER ALERT*** And I don't believe that anyone is at liberty to say. It is not a question that can be so easily answered by our text books or our knowledge; One must contemplate the answer and decide for their own self (that is exactly what one must do, hopefully as soon as possible we should all do that). Somethings are just deeper than what is found in books. The movie feels very realistic. VERY sober. This movie wasn't made in the Hollywood spirit I have come to despise, but in a different spirit full of intellectual rigor. Though there is a child in this movie, I would not recommend this movie for children, at the end **SPOILER ALERT**Billy Bob Thornton's character murders someone**END SPOILER ALERT** And most people don't like their children watching that. The title of the film sounds simple (it's just an object!) and the character seem simple, but it is a very complicated movie. I hesitantly recommend.

    THE LAWNMOWER MAN, a virtual reality-based sci-fi thriller supposedly based on a short story by Stephen King (although in reality it has nothing to do with it) is the perfect definition of a dated film. The entire premise of the film is reliant on then-cutting edge technology involving computer generated characters and VR, and of course today it looks laughable. JURASSIC PARK came out a year later and also dealt with cutting edge technology yet it hasn't dated at all, so I guess the difference is down to the budget. This is one of those films that's mildly entertaining in places and that's about it. It's a passable slice of entertainment, neither particularly good nor particularly bad, instead occupying a place in the middle of the road as with so many films. It has its good points, and the best of those is the consistently underrated Jeff Fahey, a man who's spent his life enhancing B-movies with many a decent performance. The narrative is about a simpleton who gradually transforms into a genius, and the journey there is fairly interesting, enlivened by a quirky turn from Jenny Wright as a love interest. But Pierce Brosnan's scientist lead is a bit of a bore and Brosnan gives one of those diffident performances that blight his career. Not to mention that Geoffrey Lewis is wasted while Austin O'Brien (the kid from LAST ACTION HERO) gets way too much screen time. By the end, of course, it all becomes rather overblown and over the top, complete with maniacal villainy and pyrotechnic effects. B-movie director Brett Leonard also handled two films I hated (HIDEAWAY and HIGHLANDER: THE SOURCE), along with a movie I was indifferent to (VIRTUOSITY) and I'm in the latter camp with THE LAWNMOWER MAN; it's one of those films that deserves to be forgotten except by the most dedicated sci-fi fans.

    A scientist performs experiments involving intelligence enhancing drugs and virtual reality on a simple-minded gardener. He puts the gardener on an extensive schedule of learning, and quickly he becomes brilliant. But at this point the gardener has a few ideas of his own on how the research should continue, and the scientist begins losing control of his experiments..... 1992, when this film was released, I remember the posters saying, Better effects than Terminator 2. As a fourteen year old, it sold me, I went to see it and remember the VR scenes, nothing else. Now, being a little more wiser to movie quotes, that poster quote was put there because obviously at the time, no one had anything good to say about it. and this was quite a big release back in 1992. 21 years later, and the film hasn't aged well, frankly it looks awful, and those groovy effects I saw when VR was a big thing, look terrible. As for the plot and narrative, it's basically Fahey combing his hair and dressing like Eastwood in his movies with Clyde, and Brosnan holding his head and shaking, and smoking in bed. Some say the directors cut makes it more worthwhile, filling in important plot holes, believe me it doesn't, it makes the film more of an ordeal. But it's still watchable in the car crash sense of the word. it's an unmitigated disaster, but there are a few funny scenes. But it really hasn't held up well.

    Some movies stay with us forever, being revolutionary and genuinely original. An unnaturally low (well, average) rating of this movie is extraordinary. Instead of rubbing shoulders with "Blade Runner" and "The Matrix" on the top 250 list, it finds its place in a line of average "blockheadbuster" flicks. Perhaps, this situation is a result of "Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond ... something" release. They should have created a low-end "Blade Runner 2" back in 1980s or 1990s to even the chances. For me it is difficult to find any drawbacks in this sci-fi. The whole screen presentation is a cyber kick in the brains (do we actually need all this scientific progress that pushes Man closer and closer to the edge?) and in the ass (the final scene is far from being a happy ending and the CGI talk between the scientist and his creation is still spooky even now). The movie is complete and locked in itself. The final scene with phones ringing all over the world makes one point perfectly clear: the evil has leaked through. Of course, by today's standards the computer-generated sequences, especially in the beginning of the movie, are not impressive, but the ones shown in the end are really memorable and all the way freaky. And don't make the mistake once made by me: never watch the "Lawnmower Man 2" abomination. It is like reading "Hamlet 2" by some "Shakespoore". To crown it all, it has all the guts and style to find its place in the row of such clever sci-fi flicks as "Solyaris" (1972), "Blade Runner" (1982), "Alien" (1979), and "The Terminator" (1984). It will be very interesting to know the evaluation of these original sci-fi movies in a hundred years. Will try to check it out on IMDb then, if given a chance of course. And a tough 10 goes toÂ… "The Lawnmower Man" (1992)! Thanks for attention.

    This film....there are no words that give it justice. I didn't get it at first but after a friend commented on it my mind was blown. A man who mows lawns for a living, tries to use computers to turn himself into a lawnmower, but in the end, it turns out he was a lawnmower all along...because he MOWS LAWNS! My god, i couldn't believe such a fantastic plot with those kind of deep sub plots could be done on this kind of budget, but Brett Leonard made it happen, we salute you. o\ Of course lets not forget Steven King, without his ingeniousness this would not have been written to such a high caliber. These men, they need more recognition for what they gave to people growing up in the 90's, this let us know what we could aspire too, and that in the end, we learned that it was inside us all along.

    This movie is just one purely awesome movie. From the cuts one would expect a movie that is simply showing off virtual reality, but it is much more than that. Sure enough, there are some brilliant virtual reality scenes, and it does explain things about it, but the explanation moves from a simple advertisement to the extent of the possible abuse of the technology. Lawnmowerman is not a science-fiction movie, it is a horror movie. When I say horror movie, it is not horrible monsters chasing maidens everywhere and ripping people to shreds, rather it stretches reality to a point where we can see a possibility in what is being portrayed in the movie as actually happening.

This movie looks at man's basic obsession with power. Doctor Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is really a naive scientist who has a romantic view of science. His romantic discoveries are corrupted by the Shop's desire to see how far they push the experiments in the development of a weapon of war. Angelo wants to create something that will aid humanity, but unfortunately he must go to the Shop as they are the only ones who have the facilities, but with their facilities comes the pressure to develop something they can use. Their interests are not in helping people, but in destroying people. There are two sides to everything in this movie. On the simple level there is Father Macay, who is a kind priest that took Jobe in when he was young and abandoned. On the other side he is tyrant side, using his good deeds to enslave Jobe. Jobe's simpleness creates a dichotomy, as on one hand he is innocent and friendly, where as on the other hand he is ridiculed and easily manipulated. Doctor Angelo is a brilliant scientist who is working at the cutting edge of computer science, where as he is a man who is obsessed with his work to the point that he drives away his wife.

The chimp got smarter, and had to be killed after it snatched a gun from a security guard and went on a rampage (in the hilarious opening sequence). He feels like the chimp, with its natural penchant for animalistic violence, was probably not as good an experimental subject as a person would be. Yeah, sounds like a bad idea, but he goes forward with it with the participation of his retarded lawn mowing guy, Jeff Fahey. So, yeah, Fahey eventually gets smarter and, for no particular reason, starts to use his superior powers (he becomes telepathic and telekinetic), as well as his Tron-like tracksuit, for evil. This could have been corny fun (and, honestly, at its best, it is), but between the horribly dated CGI and the far too slow pace, it's a dud. The only really good thing about it is Fahey's performance. I do love his rampage, though, where he attacks people telekinetically with his lawnmower.

    If one can look past the visual-technology used to imply effects one can be pleasantly surprised as they find themselves questioning her sympathies for other people. This movie is a product of the 90s, and as such, may not be for all people. The idea of a full-grown man befriending a small boy might seem startling to us now, but in the 90s it was rather common (if I'm remembering this correctly). Billy Bob Thornton does a spectacular job playing a "mentally challenged" man in a small town where he is misunderstood...only a child can understand him. When given the chance to help his friend, we find ourselves questioning our sympathies for other people. Even though, due to certain physical conditions I currently find myself in, I usually feel sympathetic to people who face any kind of diversity, I do not know if I can fully agree with the path that Billy's character takes. ***SPOILER ALERT***MURDERING IS WRONG IN MOST INSTANCES BUT IT IS WRONG IN THIS INSTANCE? I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY!***END SPOILER ALERT*** And I don't believe that anyone is at liberty to say. It is not a question that can be so easily answered by our text books or our knowledge; One must contemplate the answer and decide for their own self (that is exactly what one must do, hopefully as soon as possible we should all do that). Somethings are just deeper than what is found in books. The movie feels very realistic. VERY sober. This movie wasn't made in the Hollywood spirit I have come to despise, but in a different spirit full of intellectual rigor. Though there is a child in this movie, I would not recommend this movie for children, at the end **SPOILER ALERT**Billy Bob Thornton's character murders someone**END SPOILER ALERT** And most people don't like their children watching that. The title of the film sounds simple (it's just an object!) and the character seem simple, but it is a very complicated movie. I hesitantly recommend.

    THE LAWNMOWER MAN, a virtual reality-based sci-fi thriller supposedly based on a short story by Stephen King (although in reality it has nothing to do with it) is the perfect definition of a dated film. The entire premise of the film is reliant on then-cutting edge technology involving computer generated characters and VR, and of course today it looks laughable. JURASSIC PARK came out a year later and also dealt with cutting edge technology yet it hasn't dated at all, so I guess the difference is down to the budget. This is one of those films that's mildly entertaining in places and that's about it. It's a passable slice of entertainment, neither particularly good nor particularly bad, instead occupying a place in the middle of the road as with so many films. It has its good points, and the best of those is the consistently underrated Jeff Fahey, a man who's spent his life enhancing B-movies with many a decent performance. The narrative is about a simpleton who gradually transforms into a genius, and the journey there is fairly interesting, enlivened by a quirky turn from Jenny Wright as a love interest. But Pierce Brosnan's scientist lead is a bit of a bore and Brosnan gives one of those diffident performances that blight his career. Not to mention that Geoffrey Lewis is wasted while Austin O'Brien (the kid from LAST ACTION HERO) gets way too much screen time. By the end, of course, it all becomes rather overblown and over the top, complete with maniacal villainy and pyrotechnic effects. B-movie director Brett Leonard also handled two films I hated (HIDEAWAY and HIGHLANDER: THE SOURCE), along with a movie I was indifferent to (VIRTUOSITY) and I'm in the latter camp with THE LAWNMOWER MAN; it's one of those films that deserves to be forgotten except by the most dedicated sci-fi fans.

    A scientist performs experiments involving intelligence enhancing drugs and virtual reality on a simple-minded gardener. He puts the gardener on an extensive schedule of learning, and quickly he becomes brilliant. But at this point the gardener has a few ideas of his own on how the research should continue, and the scientist begins losing control of his experiments..... 1992, when this film was released, I remember the posters saying, Better effects than Terminator 2. As a fourteen year old, it sold me, I went to see it and remember the VR scenes, nothing else. Now, being a little more wiser to movie quotes, that poster quote was put there because obviously at the time, no one had anything good to say about it. and this was quite a big release back in 1992. 21 years later, and the film hasn't aged well, frankly it looks awful, and those groovy effects I saw when VR was a big thing, look terrible. As for the plot and narrative, it's basically Fahey combing his hair and dressing like Eastwood in his movies with Clyde, and Brosnan holding his head and shaking, and smoking in bed. Some say the directors cut makes it more worthwhile, filling in important plot holes, believe me it doesn't, it makes the film more of an ordeal. But it's still watchable in the car crash sense of the word. it's an unmitigated disaster, but there are a few funny scenes. But it really hasn't held up well.

    Some movies stay with us forever, being revolutionary and genuinely original. An unnaturally low (well, average) rating of this movie is extraordinary. Instead of rubbing shoulders with "Blade Runner" and "The Matrix" on the top 250 list, it finds its place in a line of average "blockheadbuster" flicks. Perhaps, this situation is a result of "Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond ... something" release. They should have created a low-end "Blade Runner 2" back in 1980s or 1990s to even the chances. For me it is difficult to find any drawbacks in this sci-fi. The whole screen presentation is a cyber kick in the brains (do we actually need all this scientific progress that pushes Man closer and closer to the edge?) and in the ass (the final scene is far from being a happy ending and the CGI talk between the scientist and his creation is still spooky even now). The movie is complete and locked in itself. The final scene with phones ringing all over the world makes one point perfectly clear: the evil has leaked through. Of course, by today's standards the computer-generated sequences, especially in the beginning of the movie, are not impressive, but the ones shown in the end are really memorable and all the way freaky. And don't make the mistake once made by me: never watch the "Lawnmower Man 2" abomination. It is like reading "Hamlet 2" by some "Shakespoore". To crown it all, it has all the guts and style to find its place in the row of such clever sci-fi flicks as "Solyaris" (1972), "Blade Runner" (1982), "Alien" (1979), and "The Terminator" (1984). It will be very interesting to know the evaluation of these original sci-fi movies in a hundred years. Will try to check it out on IMDb then, if given a chance of course. And a tough 10 goes toÂ… "The Lawnmower Man" (1992)! Thanks for attention.

A man who mows lawns for a living, tries to use computers to turn himself into a lawnmower, but in the end, it turns out he was a lawnmower all along...because he MOWS LAWNS! My god, i couldn't believe such a fantastic plot with those kind of deep sub plots could be done on this kind of budget, but Brett Leonard made it happen, we salute you. o\ Of course lets not forget Steven King, without his ingeniousness this would not have been written to such a high caliber. These men, they need more recognition for what they gave to people growing up in the 90's, this let us know what we could aspire too, and that in the end, we learned that it was inside us all along.

    This movie is just one purely awesome movie. From the cuts one would expect a movie that is simply showing off virtual reality, but it is much more than that. Sure enough, there are some brilliant virtual reality scenes, and it does explain things about it, but the explanation moves from a simple advertisement to the extent of the possible abuse of the technology. Lawnmowerman is not a science-fiction movie, it is a horror movie. When I say horror movie, it is not horrible monsters chasing maidens everywhere and ripping people to shreds, rather it stretches reality to a point where we can see a possibility in what is being portrayed in the movie as actually happening. On the cover, the credits say "based on a short story by Stephen King." There are aspects of Stephen King in this movie, such as The Shop, which is a government research facility devoted to the development of almost occult powers with the purpose of waging war, but Stephen King did not give permission to make this movie, and when he sued the makers of the movie, they were forced to remove him from the credits. This movie looks at man's basic obsession with power. Doctor Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is really a naive scientist who has a romantic view of science. His romantic discoveries are corrupted by the Shop's desire to see how far they push the experiments in the development of a weapon of war. Angelo wants to create something that will aid humanity, but unfortunately he must go to the Shop as they are the only ones who have the facilities, but with their facilities comes the pressure to develop something they can use. Their interests are not in helping people, but in destroying people. There are two sides to everything in this movie. On the simple level there is Father Macay, who is a kind priest that took Jobe in when he was young and abandoned. On the other side he is tyrant side, using his good deeds to enslave Jobe. Jobe's simpleness creates a dichotomy, as on one hand he is innocent and friendly, where as on the other hand he is ridiculed and easily manipulated. Doctor Angelo is a brilliant scientist who is working at the cutting edge of computer science, where as he is a man who is obsessed with his work to the point that he drives away his wife. The project is what reveals the greatest dichotomy. This is a breakthrough in regards to healing the retarded. People that were once ridiculed because of their backwardness can now live among normal human society. When we look deeper we notice that Doctor Angelo really does not know what he is doing. He thinks he is helping Jobe but we notice that things are changing about him. Not only is he becoming like everybody else, but he is developing extra abilities. When Jobe is first operated on, we see symbols flashing at him. These symbols appear to be related to sorcery which suggests not only that Doctor Angelo is working with things he does not understand, it also raises the possibility of an evil, uncontrollable side to it. The uncontrollable side comes out when the project 5 formula is used on Jobe. This formula is supposed to be the formula used to reach the maximum mental capacity. It had been used of chimps with surprising results, but also there was another side to it. Where as it advanced the chimps mentally, it also made them more aggressive. The same is with Jobe. We see that he advances to an extraordinary stage, he is almost a god, but he also becomes incredibly aggressive, almost inhuman. Even though, there is still a very human aspect to him. When he confronts his enemies, father Macay and Jake, he gives them a chance to repent; when they do not then they are dealt with. He does not let on that he is incredibly powerful, but once they realise it, it is too late. When Peter is trapped in VSI, Jobe cannot allow him to die. He has a choice between trying to escape the mainframe, or letting Doctor Angelo rescue him. The pain of the choice, and the humanity that still does remain within him is represented by his icon becoming flesh. An interesting event in the movie is with father Macay. Though he is a minor character, his character is developed well. He is portrayed as the typical hypocritical catholic priest. His quote "how can we let these godless creatures on the sacred altar" really outline his ignorance, especially how God created the ants. His comment on the sacred altar is meaningless because all it really is is a piece of wood with a piece of cloth on it. The sacred altar is an old testament concept, whereas Jesus' death wash all of this away. The book of Hebrews clearly outlines how these rites are no longer necessary. His ignorance is even more clearly seen when he says, "and he will bring the wrath of God upon him just like his namesake." All I can say to Father Macay, open your bible and read it. God was not angry with Job and did not punish him. Rather it is more about suffering. The bible is very clear that Job was a righteous man and that God was not punishing him. We also see the results of this ignorance when Jobe is doing his penance. He quickly finishes it off and immediately turns away from God and worships the lawnmower. This looks stupid, but it is something that really happens. The hypocrisy of many Christians drive people away from God and to other, stupid, idols, such as football. The Lawnmowerman is an awesome movie, one that I have bought, and will watch again. I love this movie and would highly recommend it to others.

    The Lawnmower Man The best thing about lawn maintenance is that you can make some extra cash selling grass clippings to stupid teenagers. However, the groundskeeper in this thriller is too thickheaded to figure that out. One day, while mowing the lawn, dimwitted Jobe (Jeff Fahey) is invited in to his client's, Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan), home to play virtual reality games. During his time with Jobe, Angelo determines that he would make an excellent lab rat for a new drug that promises to stimulate brain function. With his acumen amplified to the point of telekinesis, Jobe uses his newly minted mind powers to settle scores with those who exploited him when he was obtuse. Bearing little resemble to the Stephen King short story on which it is based, instead, The Lawnmower Man uses name recognition to capitalize off the 1990s virtual reality craze. Besides, everyone knows mixing drugs and video games only leads to obesity. (Red Light)

    The first half of this science fiction horror tale (based on a short story from Stephen King's Night Shift Collection) is thought provoking and gripping, but the latter half decides to dive deep into an eccentric and confusing mix of special effects and pseudo-scientific mayhem. Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is a brilliant but obsessed computer science specialist that is engaged in secret government experiments to create super-intelligent soldiers out of chimpanzees by using virtual reality simulations to stimulate the brain. When the experiment goes haywire, and a rogue chimp gets away, Angelo believes his destiny is to better mankind by using a human subject for his projects for the purpose of curing brain diseases and not warfare. His subject is Jobe, (played perfectly by Jeff Fahey) the half-wit lawnmower man that lives in the shed of a church next door. As Dr. Angelo's experiments progress, Jobe becomes an intelligent super-human genius whose powers eventually spiral out of control. This film is triumphant on many various levels. Films dealing with a gradual transformation/disintegration of a central character are very intriguing to watch, and this is very much "Cronenbergian" in its portrayal of Jobe and how he develops into a telekinetic mad genius from a complete idiot and ultimately becomes a tragically vengeful and emotionless entity. The themes dealing with the unlocking of the human primordial intellect and controlling its power by wisdom and not impatient force work wonderfully. The performances are superb as well as the animation sequences, and director Brett Leonard (Virtuosity) is good at integrating them into a live action film. There are many sinister government character types that add suspense to the plot, and Jenny Wright is great as the sexy seductress neighbor who has her way with Jobe. The only time this fails is when Jobe gets revenge on the government goons and the characters that antagonized him by merging his powers with the world of virtual reality resulting in some far out murder sequences that just don't seem to make any sense. Jobe eventually infuses himself with the computer mainframe, and the climax becomes a bit too bizarre, even for sci-fi computer geek fans. Nonetheless, this is a well-made, above-average assault on the senses. If you can find the VHS unrated director's cut, it is much better than the DVD release which is cut by almost twenty minutes, losing most of its character development and style. This is highly recommended for fans of mind-bending sci-fi/horror.

    This effect-laden sci-fi horror film looked pretty impressive back in 1992. But of course times move on, and such movies have a tendency to look dated quicker than most as technology marches on to new levels. I guess The Lawnmower Man is one of these films. But in fairness, it can be quite fun to look back at old special effects and see what was cutting edge back in the day. In truth, today if you were to give a 12 year old child a computer game with graphics similar to those in The Lawnmower Man, that child would turn around and laugh in your face. Such is the speed of computer technology. So yes, The Lawnmower Man no longer looks cutting-edge but neither does it look terrible, its effects work within themselves and are only occasionally atrocious, such as the burning priest. As most people already know, the story is about a simpleton who is turned into a genius via virtual reality technology. The side effect of this method is that it turns the, otherwise good natured man into an insane evil psychotic. The Lawnmower Man is neither a particularly good film, nor an especially bad one. There's certainly nothing special here, and the effects were by far its chief selling point. Without them this would almost certainly be a forgotten B-movie. Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey are reasonable enough in their roles, but they were always going to play second fiddle to the CGI. At the heart of it all it's a simple clich&eacute;d story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way.

    This movie is just one purely awesome movie. From the cuts one would expect a movie that is simply showing off virtual reality, but it is much more than that. Sure enough, there are some brilliant virtual reality scenes, and it does explain things about it, but the explanation moves from a simple advertisement to the extent of the possible abuse of the technology. Lawnmowerman is not a science-fiction movie, it is a horror movie. When I say horror movie, it is not horrible monsters chasing maidens everywhere and ripping people to shreds, rather it stretches reality to a point where we can see a possibility in what is being portrayed in the movie as actually happening. On the cover, the credits say "based on a short story by Stephen King." There are aspects of Stephen King in this movie, such as The Shop, which is a government research facility devoted to the development of almost occult powers with the purpose of waging war, but Stephen King did not give permission to make this movie, and when he sued the makers of the movie, they were forced to remove him from the credits. This movie looks at man's basic obsession with power. Doctor Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is really a naive scientist who has a romantic view of science. His romantic discoveries are corrupted by the Shop's desire to see how far they push the experiments in the development of a weapon of war. Angelo wants to create something that will aid humanity, but unfortunately he must go to the Shop as they are the only ones who have the facilities, but with their facilities comes the pressure to develop something they can use. Their interests are not in helping people, but in destroying people. There are two sides to everything in this movie. On the simple level there is Father Macay, who is a kind priest that took Jobe in when he was young and abandoned. On the other side he is tyrant side, using his good deeds to enslave Jobe. Jobe's simpleness creates a dichotomy, as on one hand he is innocent and friendly, where as on the other hand he is ridiculed and easily manipulated. Doctor Angelo is a brilliant scientist who is working at the cutting edge of computer science, where as he is a man who is obsessed with his work to the point that he drives away his wife. The project is what reveals the greatest dichotomy. This is a breakthrough in regards to healing the retarded. People that were once ridiculed because of their backwardness can now live among normal human society. When we look deeper we notice that Doctor Angelo really does not know what he is doing. He thinks he is helping Jobe but we notice that things are changing about him. Not only is he becoming like everybody else, but he is developing extra abilities. When Jobe is first operated on, we see symbols flashing at him. These symbols appear to be related to sorcery which suggests not only that Doctor Angelo is working with things he does not understand, it also raises the possibility of an evil, uncontrollable side to it. The uncontrollable side comes out when the project 5 formula is used on Jobe. This formula is supposed to be the formula used to reach the maximum mental capacity. It had been used of chimps with surprising results, but also there was another side to it. Where as it advanced the chimps mentally, it also made them more aggressive. The same is with Jobe. We see that he advances to an extraordinary stage, he is almost a god, but he also becomes incredibly aggressive, almost inhuman. Even though, there is still a very human aspect to him. When he confronts his enemies, father Macay and Jake, he gives them a chance to repent; when they do not then they are dealt with. He does not let on that he is incredibly powerful, but once they realise it, it is too late. When Peter is trapped in VSI, Jobe cannot allow him to die. He has a choice between trying to escape the mainframe, or letting Doctor Angelo rescue him. The pain of the choice, and the humanity that still does remain within him is represented by his icon becoming flesh. An interesting event in the movie is with father Macay. Though he is a minor character, his character is developed well. He is portrayed as the typical hypocritical catholic priest. His quote "how can we let these godless creatures on the sacred altar" really outline his ignorance, especially how God created the ants. His comment on the sacred altar is meaningless because all it really is is a piece of wood with a piece of cloth on it. The sacred altar is an old testament concept, whereas Jesus' death wash all of this away. The book of Hebrews clearly outlines how these rites are no longer necessary. His ignorance is even more clearly seen when he says, "and he will bring the wrath of God upon him just like his namesake." All I can say to Father Macay, open your bible and read it. God was not angry with Job and did not punish him. Rather it is more about suffering. The bible is very clear that Job was a righteous man and that God was not punishing him. We also see the results of this ignorance when Jobe is doing his penance. He quickly finishes it off and immediately turns away from God and worships the lawnmower. This looks stupid, but it is something that really happens. The hypocrisy of many Christians drive people away from God and to other, stupid, idols, such as football. The Lawnmowerman is an awesome movie, one that I have bought, and will watch again. I love this movie and would highly recommend it to others.

    The Lawnmower Man The best thing about lawn maintenance is that you can make some extra cash selling grass clippings to stupid teenagers. However, the groundskeeper in this thriller is too thickheaded to figure that out. One day, while mowing the lawn, dimwitted Jobe (Jeff Fahey) is invited in to his client's, Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan), home to play virtual reality games. During his time with Jobe, Angelo determines that he would make an excellent lab rat for a new drug that promises to stimulate brain function. With his acumen amplified to the point of telekinesis, Jobe uses his newly minted mind powers to settle scores with those who exploited him when he was obtuse. Bearing little resemble to the Stephen King short story on which it is based, instead, The Lawnmower Man uses name recognition to capitalize off the 1990s virtual reality craze. Besides, everyone knows mixing drugs and video games only leads to obesity. (Red Light)

    The first half of this science fiction horror tale (based on a short story from Stephen King's Night Shift Collection) is thought provoking and gripping, but the latter half decides to dive deep into an eccentric and confusing mix of special effects and pseudo-scientific mayhem. Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is a brilliant but obsessed computer science specialist that is engaged in secret government experiments to create super-intelligent soldiers out of chimpanzees by using virtual reality simulations to stimulate the brain. When the experiment goes haywire, and a rogue chimp gets away, Angelo believes his destiny is to better mankind by using a human subject for his projects for the purpose of curing brain diseases and not warfare. His subject is Jobe, (played perfectly by Jeff Fahey) the half-wit lawnmower man that lives in the shed of a church next door. As Dr. Angelo's experiments progress, Jobe becomes an intelligent super-human genius whose powers eventually spiral out of control. This film is triumphant on many various levels. Films dealing with a gradual transformation/disintegration of a central character are very intriguing to watch, and this is very much "Cronenbergian" in its portrayal of Jobe and how he develops into a telekinetic mad genius from a complete idiot and ultimately becomes a tragically vengeful and emotionless entity. The themes dealing with the unlocking of the human primordial intellect and controlling its power by wisdom and not impatient force work wonderfully. The performances are superb as well as the animation sequences, and director Brett Leonard (Virtuosity) is good at integrating them into a live action film. There are many sinister government character types that add suspense to the plot, and Jenny Wright is great as the sexy seductress neighbor who has her way with Jobe. The only time this fails is when Jobe gets revenge on the government goons and the characters that antagonized him by merging his powers with the world of virtual reality resulting in some far out murder sequences that just don't seem to make any sense. Jobe eventually infuses himself with the computer mainframe, and the climax becomes a bit too bizarre, even for sci-fi computer geek fans. Nonetheless, this is a well-made, above-average assault on the senses. If you can find the VHS unrated director's cut, it is much better than the DVD release which is cut by almost twenty minutes, losing most of its character development and style. This is highly recommended for fans of mind-bending sci-fi/horror.

    This effect-laden sci-fi horror film looked pretty impressive back in 1992. But of course times move on, and such movies have a tendency to look dated quicker than most as technology marches on to new levels. I guess The Lawnmower Man is one of these films. But in fairness, it can be quite fun to look back at old special effects and see what was cutting edge back in the day. In truth, today if you were to give a 12 year old child a computer game with graphics similar to those in The Lawnmower Man, that child would turn around and laugh in your face. Such is the speed of computer technology. So yes, The Lawnmower Man no longer looks cutting-edge but neither does it look terrible, its effects work within themselves and are only occasionally atrocious, such as the burning priest. As most people already know, the story is about a simpleton who is turned into a genius via virtual reality technology. The side effect of this method is that it turns the, otherwise good natured man into an insane evil psychotic. The Lawnmower Man is neither a particularly good film, nor an especially bad one. There's certainly nothing special here, and the effects were by far its chief selling point. Without them this would almost certainly be a forgotten B-movie. Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey are reasonable enough in their roles, but they were always going to play second fiddle to the CGI. At the heart of it all it's a simple clich&eacute;d story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way.

    Pierce Brosnan plays a scientist whose virtual reality experiments on a chimp have gone wrong. The chimp got smarter, and had to be killed after it snatched a gun from a security guard and went on a rampage (in the hilarious opening sequence). He feels like the chimp, with its natural penchant for animalistic violence, was probably not as good an experimental subject as a person would be. Yeah, sounds like a bad idea, but he goes forward with it with the participation of his retarded lawn mowing guy, Jeff Fahey. So, yeah, Fahey eventually gets smarter and, for no particular reason, starts to use his superior powers (he becomes telepathic and telekinetic), as well as his Tron-like tracksuit, for evil. This could have been corny fun (and, honestly, at its best, it is), but between the horribly dated CGI and the far too slow pace, it's a dud. The only really good thing about it is Fahey's performance. I do love his rampage, though, where he attacks people telekinetically with his lawnmower.

    If one can look past the visual-technology used to imply effects one can be pleasantly surprised as they find themselves questioning her sympathies for other people. This movie is a product of the 90s, and as such, may not be for all people. The idea of a full-grown man befriending a small boy might seem startling to us now, but in the 90s it was rather common (if I'm remembering this correctly). Billy Bob Thornton does a spectacular job playing a "mentally challenged" man in a small town where he is misunderstood...only a child can understand him. When given the chance to help his friend, we find ourselves questioning our sympathies for other people. Even though, due to certain physical conditions I currently find myself in, I usually feel sympathetic to people who face any kind of diversity, I do not know if I can fully agree with the path that Billy's character takes. ***SPOILER ALERT***MURDERING IS WRONG IN MOST INSTANCES BUT IT IS WRONG IN THIS INSTANCE? I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY!***END SPOILER ALERT*** And I don't believe that anyone is at liberty to say. It is not a question that can be so easily answered by our text books or our knowledge; One must contemplate the answer and decide for their own self (that is exactly what one must do, hopefully as soon as possible we should all do that). Somethings are just deeper than what is found in books. The movie feels very realistic. VERY sober. This movie wasn't made in the Hollywood spirit I have come to despise, but in a different spirit full of intellectual rigor. Though there is a child in this movie, I would not recommend this movie for children, at the end **SPOILER ALERT**Billy Bob Thornton's character murders someone**END SPOILER ALERT** And most people don't like their children watching that. The title of the film sounds simple (it's just an object!) and the character seem simple, but it is a very complicated movie. I hesitantly recommend.

    THE LAWNMOWER MAN, a virtual reality-based sci-fi thriller supposedly based on a short story by Stephen King (although in reality it has nothing to do with it) is the perfect definition of a dated film. The entire premise of the film is reliant on then-cutting edge technology involving computer generated characters and VR, and of course today it looks laughable. JURASSIC PARK came out a year later and also dealt with cutting edge technology yet it hasn't dated at all, so I guess the difference is down to the budget. This is one of those films that's mildly entertaining in places and that's about it. It's a passable slice of entertainment, neither particularly good nor particularly bad, instead occupying a place in the middle of the road as with so many films. It has its good points, and the best of those is the consistently underrated Jeff Fahey, a man who's spent his life enhancing B-movies with many a decent performance. The narrative is about a simpleton who gradually transforms into a genius, and the journey there is fairly interesting, enlivened by a quirky turn from Jenny Wright as a love interest. But Pierce Brosnan's scientist lead is a bit of a bore and Brosnan gives one of those diffident performances that blight his career. Not to mention that Geoffrey Lewis is wasted while Austin O'Brien (the kid from LAST ACTION HERO) gets way too much screen time. By the end, of course, it all becomes rather overblown and over the top, complete with maniacal villainy and pyrotechnic effects. B-movie director Brett Leonard also handled two films I hated (HIDEAWAY and HIGHLANDER: THE SOURCE), along with a movie I was indifferent to (VIRTUOSITY) and I'm in the latter camp with THE LAWNMOWER MAN; it's one of those films that deserves to be forgotten except by the most dedicated sci-fi fans.

    A scientist performs experiments involving intelligence enhancing drugs and virtual reality on a simple-minded gardener. He puts the gardener on an extensive schedule of learning, and quickly he becomes brilliant. But at this point the gardener has a few ideas of his own on how the research should continue, and the scientist begins losing control of his experiments..... 1992, when this film was released, I remember the posters saying, Better effects than Terminator 2. As a fourteen year old, it sold me, I went to see it and remember the VR scenes, nothing else. Now, being a little more wiser to movie quotes, that poster quote was put there because obviously at the time, no one had anything good to say about it. and this was quite a big release back in 1992. 21 years later, and the film hasn't aged well, frankly it looks awful, and those groovy effects I saw when VR was a big thing, look terrible. As for the plot and narrative, it's basically Fahey combing his hair and dressing like Eastwood in his movies with Clyde, and Brosnan holding his head and shaking, and smoking in bed. Some say the directors cut makes it more worthwhile, filling in important plot holes, believe me it doesn't, it makes the film more of an ordeal. But it's still watchable in the car crash sense of the word. it's an unmitigated disaster, but there are a few funny scenes. But it really hasn't held up well.

    Some movies stay with us forever, being revolutionary and genuinely original. An unnaturally low (well, average) rating of this movie is extraordinary. Instead of rubbing shoulders with "Blade Runner" and "The Matrix" on the top 250 list, it finds its place in a line of average "blockheadbuster" flicks. Perhaps, this situation is a result of "Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond ... something" release. They should have created a low-end "Blade Runner 2" back in 1980s or 1990s to even the chances. For me it is difficult to find any drawbacks in this sci-fi. The whole screen presentation is a cyber kick in the brains (do we actually need all this scientific progress that pushes Man closer and closer to the edge?) and in the ass (the final scene is far from being a happy ending and the CGI talk between the scientist and his creation is still spooky even now). The movie is complete and locked in itself. The final scene with phones ringing all over the world makes one point perfectly clear: the evil has leaked through. Of course, by today's standards the computer-generated sequences, especially in the beginning of the movie, are not impressive, but the ones shown in the end are really memorable and all the way freaky. And don't make the mistake once made by me: never watch the "Lawnmower Man 2" abomination. It is like reading "Hamlet 2" by some "Shakespoore". To crown it all, it has all the guts and style to find its place in the row of such clever sci-fi flicks as "Solyaris" (1972), "Blade Runner" (1982), "Alien" (1979), and "The Terminator" (1984). It will be very interesting to know the evaluation of these original sci-fi movies in a hundred years. Will try to check it out on IMDb then, if given a chance of course. And a tough 10 goes toÂ… "The Lawnmower Man" (1992)! Thanks for attention.

    This film....there are no words that give it justice. I didn't get it at first but after a friend commented on it my mind was blown. A man who mows lawns for a living, tries to use computers to turn himself into a lawnmower, but in the end, it turns out he was a lawnmower all along...because he MOWS LAWNS! My god, i couldn't believe such a fantastic plot with those kind of deep sub plots could be done on this kind of budget, but Brett Leonard made it happen, we salute you. o\ Of course lets not forget Steven King, without his ingeniousness this would not have been written to such a high caliber. These men, they need more recognition for what they gave to people growing up in the 90's, this let us know what we could aspire too, and that in the end, we learned that it was inside us all along.

At the heart of it all it's a simple clich&eacute;d story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way.

    Pierce Brosnan plays a scientist whose virtual reality experiments on a chimp have gone wrong. The chimp got smarter, and had to be killed after it snatched a gun from a security guard and went on a rampage (in the hilarious opening sequence). He feels like the chimp, with its natural penchant for animalistic violence, was probably not as good an experimental subject as a person would be. Yeah, sounds like a bad idea, but he goes forward with it with the participation of his retarded lawn mowing guy, Jeff Fahey. So, yeah, Fahey eventually gets smarter and, for no particular reason, starts to use his superior powers (he becomes telepathic and telekinetic), as well as his Tron-like tracksuit, for evil. This could have been corny fun (and, honestly, at its best, it is), but between the horribly dated CGI and the far too slow pace, it's a dud. The only really good thing about it is Fahey's performance. I do love his rampage, though, where he attacks people telekinetically with his lawnmower.

    If one can look past the visual-technology used to imply effects one can be pleasantly surprised as they find themselves questioning her sympathies for other people. This movie is a product of the 90s, and as such, may not be for all people. The idea of a full-grown man befriending a small boy might seem startling to us now, but in the 90s it was rather common (if I'm remembering this correctly). Billy Bob Thornton does a spectacular job playing a "mentally challenged" man in a small town where he is misunderstood...only a child can understand him. When given the chance to help his friend, we find ourselves questioning our sympathies for other people. Even though, due to certain physical conditions I currently find myself in, I usually feel sympathetic to people who face any kind of diversity, I do not know if I can fully agree with the path that Billy's character takes. ***SPOILER ALERT***MURDERING IS WRONG IN MOST INSTANCES BUT IT IS WRONG IN THIS INSTANCE? I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY!***END SPOILER ALERT*** And I don't believe that anyone is at liberty to say. It is not a question that can be so easily answered by our text books or our knowledge; One must contemplate the answer and decide for their own self (that is exactly what one must do, hopefully as soon as possible we should all do that). Somethings are just deeper than what is found in books. The movie feels very realistic. VERY sober. This movie wasn't made in the Hollywood spirit I have come to despise, but in a different spirit full of intellectual rigor. Though there is a child in this movie, I would not recommend this movie for children, at the end **SPOILER ALERT**Billy Bob Thornton's character murders someone**END SPOILER ALERT** And most people don't like their children watching that. The title of the film sounds simple (it's just an object!) and the character seem simple, but it is a very complicated movie. I hesitantly recommend.

    THE LAWNMOWER MAN, a virtual reality-based sci-fi thriller supposedly based on a short story by Stephen King (although in reality it has nothing to do with it) is the perfect definition of a dated film. The entire premise of the film is reliant on then-cutting edge technology involving computer generated characters and VR, and of course today it looks laughable. JURASSIC PARK came out a year later and also dealt with cutting edge technology yet it hasn't dated at all, so I guess the difference is down to the budget. This is one of those films that's mildly entertaining in places and that's about it. It's a passable slice of entertainment, neither particularly good nor particularly bad, instead occupying a place in the middle of the road as with so many films. It has its good points, and the best of those is the consistently underrated Jeff Fahey, a man who's spent his life enhancing B-movies with many a decent performance. The narrative is about a simpleton who gradually transforms into a genius, and the journey there is fairly interesting, enlivened by a quirky turn from Jenny Wright as a love interest. But Pierce Brosnan's scientist lead is a bit of a bore and Brosnan gives one of those diffident performances that blight his career. Not to mention that Geoffrey Lewis is wasted while Austin O'Brien (the kid from LAST ACTION HERO) gets way too much screen time. By the end, of course, it all becomes rather overblown and over the top, complete with maniacal villainy and pyrotechnic effects. B-movie director Brett Leonard also handled two films I hated (HIDEAWAY and HIGHLANDER: THE SOURCE), along with a movie I was indifferent to (VIRTUOSITY) and I'm in the latter camp with THE LAWNMOWER MAN; it's one of those films that deserves to be forgotten except by the most dedicated sci-fi fans.

    A scientist performs experiments involving intelligence enhancing drugs and virtual reality on a simple-minded gardener. He puts the gardener on an extensive schedule of learning, and quickly he becomes brilliant. But at this point the gardener has a few ideas of his own on how the research should continue, and the scientist begins losing control of his experiments..... 1992, when this film was released, I remember the posters saying, Better effects than Terminator 2. As a fourteen year old, it sold me, I went to see it and remember the VR scenes, nothing else. Now, being a little more wiser to movie quotes, that poster quote was put there because obviously at the time, no one had anything good to say about it. and this was quite a big release back in 1992. 21 years later, and the film hasn't aged well, frankly it looks awful, and those groovy effects I saw when VR was a big thing, look terrible. As for the plot and narrative, it's basically Fahey combing his hair and dressing like Eastwood in his movies with Clyde, and Brosnan holding his head and shaking, and smoking in bed. Some say the directors cut makes it more worthwhile, filling in important plot holes, believe me it doesn't, it makes the film more of an ordeal. But it's still watchable in the car crash sense of the word. it's an unmitigated disaster, but there are a few funny scenes. But it really hasn't held up well.

    Some movies stay with us forever, being revolutionary and genuinely original. An unnaturally low (well, average) rating of this movie is extraordinary. Instead of rubbing shoulders with "Blade Runner" and "The Matrix" on the top 250 list, it finds its place in a line of average "blockheadbuster" flicks. Perhaps, this situation is a result of "Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond ... something" release. They should have created a low-end "Blade Runner 2" back in 1980s or 1990s to even the chances. For me it is difficult to find any drawbacks in this sci-fi. The whole screen presentation is a cyber kick in the brains (do we actually need all this scientific progress that pushes Man closer and closer to the edge?) and in the ass (the final scene is far from being a happy ending and the CGI talk between the scientist and his creation is still spooky even now). The movie is complete and locked in itself. The final scene with phones ringing all over the world makes one point perfectly clear: the evil has leaked through. Of course, by today's standards the computer-generated sequences, especially in the beginning of the movie, are not impressive, but the ones shown in the end are really memorable and all the way freaky. And don't make the mistake once made by me: never watch the "Lawnmower Man 2" abomination. It is like reading "Hamlet 2" by some "Shakespoore". To crown it all, it has all the guts and style to find its place in the row of such clever sci-fi flicks as "Solyaris" (1972), "Blade Runner" (1982), "Alien" (1979), and "The Terminator" (1984). It will be very interesting to know the evaluation of these original sci-fi movies in a hundred years. Will try to check it out on IMDb then, if given a chance of course. And a tough 10 goes toÂ… "The Lawnmower Man" (1992)! Thanks for attention.

    This film....there are no words that give it justice. I didn't get it at first but after a friend commented on it my mind was blown. A man who mows lawns for a living, tries to use computers to turn himself into a lawnmower, but in the end, it turns out he was a lawnmower all along...because he MOWS LAWNS! My god, i couldn't believe such a fantastic plot with those kind of deep sub plots could be done on this kind of budget, but Brett Leonard made it happen, we salute you. o\ Of course lets not forget Steven King, without his ingeniousness this would not have been written to such a high caliber. These men, they need more recognition for what they gave to people growing up in the 90's, this let us know what we could aspire too, and that in the end, we learned that it was inside us all along.

    This movie is just one purely awesome movie. From the cuts one would expect a movie that is simply showing off virtual reality, but it is much more than that. Sure enough, there are some brilliant virtual reality scenes, and it does explain things about it, but the explanation moves from a simple advertisement to the extent of the possible abuse of the technology. Lawnmowerman is not a science-fiction movie, it is a horror movie. When I say horror movie, it is not horrible monsters chasing maidens everywhere and ripping people to shreds, rather it stretches reality to a point where we can see a possibility in what is being portrayed in the movie as actually happening. On the cover, the credits say "based on a short story by Stephen King." There are aspects of Stephen King in this movie, such as The Shop, which is a government research facility devoted to the development of almost occult powers with the purpose of waging war, but Stephen King did not give permission to make this movie, and when he sued the makers of the movie, they were forced to remove him from the credits. This movie looks at man's basic obsession with power. Doctor Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is really a naive scientist who has a romantic view of science. His romantic discoveries are corrupted by the Shop's desire to see how far they push the experiments in the development of a weapon of war. Angelo wants to create something that will aid humanity, but unfortunately he must go to the Shop as they are the only ones who have the facilities, but with their facilities comes the pressure to develop something they can use. Their interests are not in helping people, but in destroying people. There are two sides to everything in this movie. On the simple level there is Father Macay, who is a kind priest that took Jobe in when he was young and abandoned. On the other side he is tyrant side, using his good deeds to enslave Jobe. Jobe's simpleness creates a dichotomy, as on one hand he is innocent and friendly, where as on the other hand he is ridiculed and easily manipulated. Doctor Angelo is a brilliant scientist who is working at the cutting edge of computer science, where as he is a man who is obsessed with his work to the point that he drives away his wife. The project is what reveals the greatest dichotomy. This is a breakthrough in regards to healing the retarded. People that were once ridiculed because of their backwardness can now live among normal human society. When we look deeper we notice that Doctor Angelo really does not know what he is doing. He thinks he is helping Jobe but we notice that things are changing about him. Not only is he becoming like everybody else, but he is developing extra abilities. When Jobe is first operated on, we see symbols flashing at him. These symbols appear to be related to sorcery which suggests not only that Doctor Angelo is working with things he does not understand, it also raises the possibility of an evil, uncontrollable side to it. The uncontrollable side comes out when the project 5 formula is used on Jobe. This formula is supposed to be the formula used to reach the maximum mental capacity. It had been used of chimps with surprising results, but also there was another side to it. Where as it advanced the chimps mentally, it also made them more aggressive. The same is with Jobe. We see that he advances to an extraordinary stage, he is almost a god, but he also becomes incredibly aggressive, almost inhuman. Even though, there is still a very human aspect to him. When he confronts his enemies, father Macay and Jake, he gives them a chance to repent; when they do not then they are dealt with. He does not let on that he is incredibly powerful, but once they realise it, it is too late. When Peter is trapped in VSI, Jobe cannot allow him to die. He has a choice between trying to escape the mainframe, or letting Doctor Angelo rescue him. The pain of the choice, and the humanity that still does remain within him is represented by his icon becoming flesh. An interesting event in the movie is with father Macay. Though he is a minor character, his character is developed well. He is portrayed as the typical hypocritical catholic priest. His quote "how can we let these godless creatures on the sacred altar" really outline his ignorance, especially how God created the ants. His comment on the sacred altar is meaningless because all it really is is a piece of wood with a piece of cloth on it. The sacred altar is an old testament concept, whereas Jesus' death wash all of this away. The book of Hebrews clearly outlines how these rites are no longer necessary. His ignorance is even more clearly seen when he says, "and he will bring the wrath of God upon him just like his namesake." All I can say to Father Macay, open your bible and read it. God was not angry with Job and did not punish him. Rather it is more about suffering. The bible is very clear that Job was a righteous man and that God was not punishing him. We also see the results of this ignorance when Jobe is doing his penance. He quickly finishes it off and immediately turns away from God and worships the lawnmower. This looks stupid, but it is something that really happens. The hypocrisy of many Christians drive people away from God and to other, stupid, idols, such as football. The Lawnmowerman is an awesome movie, one that I have bought, and will watch again. I love this movie and would highly recommend it to others.

    The Lawnmower Man The best thing about lawn maintenance is that you can make some extra cash selling grass clippings to stupid teenagers. However, the groundskeeper in this thriller is too thickheaded to figure that out. One day, while mowing the lawn, dimwitted Jobe (Jeff Fahey) is invited in to his client's, Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan), home to play virtual reality games. During his time with Jobe, Angelo determines that he would make an excellent lab rat for a new drug that promises to stimulate brain function. With his acumen amplified to the point of telekinesis, Jobe uses his newly minted mind powers to settle scores with those who exploited him when he was obtuse. Bearing little resemble to the Stephen King short story on which it is based, instead, The Lawnmower Man uses name recognition to capitalize off the 1990s virtual reality craze. Besides, everyone knows mixing drugs and video games only leads to obesity. (Red Light)

    The first half of this science fiction horror tale (based on a short story from Stephen King's Night Shift Collection) is thought provoking and gripping, but the latter half decides to dive deep into an eccentric and confusing mix of special effects and pseudo-scientific mayhem. Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is a brilliant but obsessed computer science specialist that is engaged in secret government experiments to create super-intelligent soldiers out of chimpanzees by using virtual reality simulations to stimulate the brain. When the experiment goes haywire, and a rogue chimp gets away, Angelo believes his destiny is to better mankind by using a human subject for his projects for the purpose of curing brain diseases and not warfare. His subject is Jobe, (played perfectly by Jeff Fahey) the half-wit lawnmower man that lives in the shed of a church next door. As Dr. Angelo's experiments progress, Jobe becomes an intelligent super-human genius whose powers eventually spiral out of control. This film is triumphant on many various levels. Films dealing with a gradual transformation/disintegration of a central character are very intriguing to watch, and this is very much "Cronenbergian" in its portrayal of Jobe and how he develops into a telekinetic mad genius from a complete idiot and ultimately becomes a tragically vengeful and emotionless entity. The themes dealing with the unlocking of the human primordial intellect and controlling its power by wisdom and not impatient force work wonderfully. The performances are superb as well as the animation sequences, and director Brett Leonard (Virtuosity) is good at integrating them into a live action film. There are many sinister government character types that add suspense to the plot, and Jenny Wright is great as the sexy seductress neighbor who has her way with Jobe. The only time this fails is when Jobe gets revenge on the government goons and the characters that antagonized him by merging his powers with the world of virtual reality resulting in some far out murder sequences that just don't seem to make any sense. Jobe eventually infuses himself with the computer mainframe, and the climax becomes a bit too bizarre, even for sci-fi computer geek fans. Nonetheless, this is a well-made, above-average assault on the senses. If you can find the VHS unrated director's cut, it is much better than the DVD release which is cut by almost twenty minutes, losing most of its character development and style. This is highly recommended for fans of mind-bending sci-fi/horror.

    This effect-laden sci-fi horror film looked pretty impressive back in 1992. But of course times move on, and such movies have a tendency to look dated quicker than most as technology marches on to new levels. I guess The Lawnmower Man is one of these films. But in fairness, it can be quite fun to look back at old special effects and see what was cutting edge back in the day. In truth, today if you were to give a 12 year old child a computer game with graphics similar to those in The Lawnmower Man, that child would turn around and laugh in your face. Such is the speed of computer technology. So yes, The Lawnmower Man no longer looks cutting-edge but neither does it look terrible, its effects work within themselves and are only occasionally atrocious, such as the burning priest. As most people already know, the story is about a simpleton who is turned into a genius via virtual reality technology. The side effect of this method is that it turns the, otherwise good natured man into an insane evil psychotic. The Lawnmower Man is neither a particularly good film, nor an especially bad one. There's certainly nothing special here, and the effects were by far its chief selling point. Without them this would almost certainly be a forgotten B-movie. Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey are reasonable enough in their roles, but they were always going to play second fiddle to the CGI. At the heart of it all it's a simple clich&eacute;d story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way.

A man who mows lawns for a living, tries to use computers to turn himself into a lawnmower, but in the end, it turns out he was a lawnmower all along...because he MOWS LAWNS! My god, i couldn't believe such a fantastic plot with those kind of deep sub plots could be done on this kind of budget, but Brett Leonard made it happen, we salute you. o\ Of course lets not forget Steven King, without his ingeniousness this would not have been written to such a high caliber. These men, they need more recognition for what they gave to people growing up in the 90's, this let us know what we could aspire too, and that in the end, we learned that it was inside us all along.

    This movie is just one purely awesome movie. From the cuts one would expect a movie that is simply showing off virtual reality, but it is much more than that. Sure enough, there are some brilliant virtual reality scenes, and it does explain things about it, but the explanation moves from a simple advertisement to the extent of the possible abuse of the technology. Lawnmowerman is not a science-fiction movie, it is a horror movie. When I say horror movie, it is not horrible monsters chasing maidens everywhere and ripping people to shreds, rather it stretches reality to a point where we can see a possibility in what is being portrayed in the movie as actually happening. On the cover, the credits say "based on a short story by Stephen King." There are aspects of Stephen King in this movie, such as The Shop, which is a government research facility devoted to the development of almost occult powers with the purpose of waging war, but Stephen King did not give permission to make this movie, and when he sued the makers of the movie, they were forced to remove him from the credits. This movie looks at man's basic obsession with power. Doctor Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is really a naive scientist who has a romantic view of science. His romantic discoveries are corrupted by the Shop's desire to see how far they push the experiments in the development of a weapon of war. Angelo wants to create something that will aid humanity, but unfortunately he must go to the Shop as they are the only ones who have the facilities, but with their facilities comes the pressure to develop something they can use. Their interests are not in helping people, but in destroying people. There are two sides to everything in this movie. On the simple level there is Father Macay, who is a kind priest that took Jobe in when he was young and abandoned. On the other side he is tyrant side, using his good deeds to enslave Jobe. Jobe's simpleness creates a dichotomy, as on one hand he is innocent and friendly, where as on the other hand he is ridiculed and easily manipulated. Doctor Angelo is a brilliant scientist who is working at the cutting edge of computer science, where as he is a man who is obsessed with his work to the point that he drives away his wife. The project is what reveals the greatest dichotomy. This is a breakthrough in regards to healing the retarded. People that were once ridiculed because of their backwardness can now live among normal human society. When we look deeper we notice that Doctor Angelo really does not know what he is doing. He thinks he is helping Jobe but we notice that things are changing about him. Not only is he becoming like everybody else, but he is developing extra abilities. When Jobe is first operated on, we see symbols flashing at him. These symbols appear to be related to sorcery which suggests not only that Doctor Angelo is working with things he does not understand, it also raises the possibility of an evil, uncontrollable side to it. The uncontrollable side comes out when the project 5 formula is used on Jobe. This formula is supposed to be the formula used to reach the maximum mental capacity. It had been used of chimps with surprising results, but also there was another side to it. Where as it advanced the chimps mentally, it also made them more aggressive. The same is with Jobe. We see that he advances to an extraordinary stage, he is almost a god, but he also becomes incredibly aggressive, almost inhuman. Even though, there is still a very human aspect to him. When he confronts his enemies, father Macay and Jake, he gives them a chance to repent; when they do not then they are dealt with. He does not let on that he is incredibly powerful, but once they realise it, it is too late. When Peter is trapped in VSI, Jobe cannot allow him to die. He has a choice between trying to escape the mainframe, or letting Doctor Angelo rescue him. The pain of the choice, and the humanity that still does remain within him is represented by his icon becoming flesh. An interesting event in the movie is with father Macay. Though he is a minor character, his character is developed well. He is portrayed as the typical hypocritical catholic priest. His quote "how can we let these godless creatures on the sacred altar" really outline his ignorance, especially how God created the ants. His comment on the sacred altar is meaningless because all it really is is a piece of wood with a piece of cloth on it. The sacred altar is an old testament concept, whereas Jesus' death wash all of this away. The book of Hebrews clearly outlines how these rites are no longer necessary. His ignorance is even more clearly seen when he says, "and he will bring the wrath of God upon him just like his namesake." All I can say to Father Macay, open your bible and read it. God was not angry with Job and did not punish him. Rather it is more about suffering. The bible is very clear that Job was a righteous man and that God was not punishing him. We also see the results of this ignorance when Jobe is doing his penance. He quickly finishes it off and immediately turns away from God and worships the lawnmower. This looks stupid, but it is something that really happens. The hypocrisy of many Christians drive people away from God and to other, stupid, idols, such as football. The Lawnmowerman is an awesome movie, one that I have bought, and will watch again. I love this movie and would highly recommend it to others.

    The Lawnmower Man The best thing about lawn maintenance is that you can make some extra cash selling grass clippings to stupid teenagers. However, the groundskeeper in this thriller is too thickheaded to figure that out. One day, while mowing the lawn, dimwitted Jobe (Jeff Fahey) is invited in to his client's, Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan), home to play virtual reality games. During his time with Jobe, Angelo determines that he would make an excellent lab rat for a new drug that promises to stimulate brain function. With his acumen amplified to the point of telekinesis, Jobe uses his newly minted mind powers to settle scores with those who exploited him when he was obtuse. Bearing little resemble to the Stephen King short story on which it is based, instead, The Lawnmower Man uses name recognition to capitalize off the 1990s virtual reality craze. Besides, everyone knows mixing drugs and video games only leads to obesity. (Red Light)

    The first half of this science fiction horror tale (based on a short story from Stephen King's Night Shift Collection) is thought provoking and gripping, but the latter half decides to dive deep into an eccentric and confusing mix of special effects and pseudo-scientific mayhem. Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is a brilliant but obsessed computer science specialist that is engaged in secret government experiments to create super-intelligent soldiers out of chimpanzees by using virtual reality simulations to stimulate the brain. When the experiment goes haywire, and a rogue chimp gets away, Angelo believes his destiny is to better mankind by using a human subject for his projects for the purpose of curing brain diseases and not warfare. His subject is Jobe, (played perfectly by Jeff Fahey) the half-wit lawnmower man that lives in the shed of a church next door. As Dr. Angelo's experiments progress, Jobe becomes an intelligent super-human genius whose powers eventually spiral out of control. This film is triumphant on many various levels. Films dealing with a gradual transformation/disintegration of a central character are very intriguing to watch, and this is very much "Cronenbergian" in its portrayal of Jobe and how he develops into a telekinetic mad genius from a complete idiot and ultimately becomes a tragically vengeful and emotionless entity. The themes dealing with the unlocking of the human primordial intellect and controlling its power by wisdom and not impatient force work wonderfully. The performances are superb as well as the animation sequences, and director Brett Leonard (Virtuosity) is good at integrating them into a live action film. There are many sinister government character types that add suspense to the plot, and Jenny Wright is great as the sexy seductress neighbor who has her way with Jobe. The only time this fails is when Jobe gets revenge on the government goons and the characters that antagonized him by merging his powers with the world of virtual reality resulting in some far out murder sequences that just don't seem to make any sense. Jobe eventually infuses himself with the computer mainframe, and the climax becomes a bit too bizarre, even for sci-fi computer geek fans. Nonetheless, this is a well-made, above-average assault on the senses. If you can find the VHS unrated director's cut, it is much better than the DVD release which is cut by almost twenty minutes, losing most of its character development and style. This is highly recommended for fans of mind-bending sci-fi/horror.

    This effect-laden sci-fi horror film looked pretty impressive back in 1992. But of course times move on, and such movies have a tendency to look dated quicker than most as technology marches on to new levels. I guess The Lawnmower Man is one of these films. But in fairness, it can be quite fun to look back at old special effects and see what was cutting edge back in the day. In truth, today if you were to give a 12 year old child a computer game with graphics similar to those in The Lawnmower Man, that child would turn around and laugh in your face. Such is the speed of computer technology. So yes, The Lawnmower Man no longer looks cutting-edge but neither does it look terrible, its effects work within themselves and are only occasionally atrocious, such as the burning priest. As most people already know, the story is about a simpleton who is turned into a genius via virtual reality technology. The side effect of this method is that it turns the, otherwise good natured man into an insane evil psychotic. The Lawnmower Man is neither a particularly good film, nor an especially bad one. There's certainly nothing special here, and the effects were by far its chief selling point. Without them this would almost certainly be a forgotten B-movie. Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey are reasonable enough in their roles, but they were always going to play second fiddle to the CGI. At the heart of it all it's a simple clich&eacute;d story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way.

    Pierce Brosnan plays a scientist whose virtual reality experiments on a chimp have gone wrong. The chimp got smarter, and had to be killed after it snatched a gun from a security guard and went on a rampage (in the hilarious opening sequence). He feels like the chimp, with its natural penchant for animalistic violence, was probably not as good an experimental subject as a person would be. Yeah, sounds like a bad idea, but he goes forward with it with the participation of his retarded lawn mowing guy, Jeff Fahey. So, yeah, Fahey eventually gets smarter and, for no particular reason, starts to use his superior powers (he becomes telepathic and telekinetic), as well as his Tron-like tracksuit, for evil. This could have been corny fun (and, honestly, at its best, it is), but between the horribly dated CGI and the far too slow pace, it's a dud. The only really good thing about it is Fahey's performance. I do love his rampage, though, where he attacks people telekinetically with his lawnmower.

    If one can look past the visual-technology used to imply effects one can be pleasantly surprised as they find themselves questioning her sympathies for other people. This movie is a product of the 90s, and as such, may not be for all people. The idea of a full-grown man befriending a small boy might seem startling to us now, but in the 90s it was rather common (if I'm remembering this correctly). Billy Bob Thornton does a spectacular job playing a "mentally challenged" man in a small town where he is misunderstood...only a child can understand him. When given the chance to help his friend, we find ourselves questioning our sympathies for other people. Even though, due to certain physical conditions I currently find myself in, I usually feel sympathetic to people who face any kind of diversity, I do not know if I can fully agree with the path that Billy's character takes. ***SPOILER ALERT***MURDERING IS WRONG IN MOST INSTANCES BUT IT IS WRONG IN THIS INSTANCE? I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY!***END SPOILER ALERT*** And I don't believe that anyone is at liberty to say. It is not a question that can be so easily answered by our text books or our knowledge; One must contemplate the answer and decide for their own self (that is exactly what one must do, hopefully as soon as possible we should all do that). Somethings are just deeper than what is found in books. The movie feels very realistic. VERY sober. This movie wasn't made in the Hollywood spirit I have come to despise, but in a different spirit full of intellectual rigor. Though there is a child in this movie, I would not recommend this movie for children, at the end **SPOILER ALERT**Billy Bob Thornton's character murders someone**END SPOILER ALERT** And most people don't like their children watching that. The title of the film sounds simple (it's just an object!) and the character seem simple, but it is a very complicated movie. I hesitantly recommend.

    THE LAWNMOWER MAN, a virtual reality-based sci-fi thriller supposedly based on a short story by Stephen King (although in reality it has nothing to do with it) is the perfect definition of a dated film. The entire premise of the film is reliant on then-cutting edge technology involving computer generated characters and VR, and of course today it looks laughable. JURASSIC PARK came out a year later and also dealt with cutting edge technology yet it hasn't dated at all, so I guess the difference is down to the budget. This is one of those films that's mildly entertaining in places and that's about it. It's a passable slice of entertainment, neither particularly good nor particularly bad, instead occupying a place in the middle of the road as with so many films. It has its good points, and the best of those is the consistently underrated Jeff Fahey, a man who's spent his life enhancing B-movies with many a decent performance. The narrative is about a simpleton who gradually transforms into a genius, and the journey there is fairly interesting, enlivened by a quirky turn from Jenny Wright as a love interest. But Pierce Brosnan's scientist lead is a bit of a bore and Brosnan gives one of those diffident performances that blight his career. Not to mention that Geoffrey Lewis is wasted while Austin O'Brien (the kid from LAST ACTION HERO) gets way too much screen time. By the end, of course, it all becomes rather overblown and over the top, complete with maniacal villainy and pyrotechnic effects. B-movie director Brett Leonard also handled two films I hated (HIDEAWAY and HIGHLANDER: THE SOURCE), along with a movie I was indifferent to (VIRTUOSITY) and I'm in the latter camp with THE LAWNMOWER MAN; it's one of those films that deserves to be forgotten except by the most dedicated sci-fi fans.

    A scientist performs experiments involving intelligence enhancing drugs and virtual reality on a simple-minded gardener. He puts the gardener on an extensive schedule of learning, and quickly he becomes brilliant. But at this point the gardener has a few ideas of his own on how the research should continue, and the scientist begins losing control of his experiments..... 1992, when this film was released, I remember the posters saying, Better effects than Terminator 2. As a fourteen year old, it sold me, I went to see it and remember the VR scenes, nothing else. Now, being a little more wiser to movie quotes, that poster quote was put there because obviously at the time, no one had anything good to say about it. and this was quite a big release back in 1992. 21 years later, and the film hasn't aged well, frankly it looks awful, and those groovy effects I saw when VR was a big thing, look terrible. As for the plot and narrative, it's basically Fahey combing his hair and dressing like Eastwood in his movies with Clyde, and Brosnan holding his head and shaking, and smoking in bed. Some say the directors cut makes it more worthwhile, filling in important plot holes, believe me it doesn't, it makes the film more of an ordeal. But it's still watchable in the car crash sense of the word. it's an unmitigated disaster, but there are a few funny scenes. But it really hasn't held up well.

    Some movies stay with us forever, being revolutionary and genuinely original. An unnaturally low (well, average) rating of this movie is extraordinary. Instead of rubbing shoulders with "Blade Runner" and "The Matrix" on the top 250 list, it finds its place in a line of average "blockheadbuster" flicks. Perhaps, this situation is a result of "Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond ... something" release. They should have created a low-end "Blade Runner 2" back in 1980s or 1990s to even the chances. For me it is difficult to find any drawbacks in this sci-fi. The whole screen presentation is a cyber kick in the brains (do we actually need all this scientific progress that pushes Man closer and closer to the edge?) and in the ass (the final scene is far from being a happy ending and the CGI talk between the scientist and his creation is still spooky even now). The movie is complete and locked in itself. The final scene with phones ringing all over the world makes one point perfectly clear: the evil has leaked through. Of course, by today's standards the computer-generated sequences, especially in the beginning of the movie, are not impressive, but the ones shown in the end are really memorable and all the way freaky. And don't make the mistake once made by me: never watch the "Lawnmower Man 2" abomination. It is like reading "Hamlet 2" by some "Shakespoore". To crown it all, it has all the guts and style to find its place in the row of such clever sci-fi flicks as "Solyaris" (1972), "Blade Runner" (1982), "Alien" (1979), and "The Terminator" (1984). It will be very interesting to know the evaluation of these original sci-fi movies in a hundred years. Will try to check it out on IMDb then, if given a chance of course. And a tough 10 goes toÂ… "The Lawnmower Man" (1992)! Thanks for attention.

But in fairness, it can be quite fun to look back at old special effects and see what was cutting edge back in the day. In truth, today if you were to give a 12 year old child a computer game with graphics similar to those in The Lawnmower Man, that child would turn around and laugh in your face. Such is the speed of computer technology. So yes, The Lawnmower Man no longer looks cutting-edge but neither does it look terrible, its effects work within themselves and are only occasionally atrocious, such as the burning priest. As most people already know, the story is about a simpleton who is turned into a genius via virtual reality technology. The side effect of this method is that it turns the, otherwise good natured man into an insane evil psychotic. The Lawnmower Man is neither a particularly good film, nor an especially bad one. There's certainly nothing special here, and the effects were by far its chief selling point. Without them this would almost certainly be a forgotten B-movie. Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Fahey are reasonable enough in their roles, but they were always going to play second fiddle to the CGI. At the heart of it all it's a simple clich&eacute;d story that doesn't really hold very many surprises to be perfectly honest. But it's still quite good fun in a silly kind of a way.

    Pierce Brosnan plays a scientist whose virtual reality experiments on a chimp have gone wrong. The chimp got smarter, and had to be killed after it snatched a gun from a security guard and went on a rampage (in the hilarious opening sequence). He feels like the chimp, with its natural penchant for animalistic violence, was probably not as good an experimental subject as a person would be. Yeah, sounds like a bad idea, but he goes forward with it with the participation of his retarded lawn mowing guy, Jeff Fahey. So, yeah, Fahey eventually gets smarter and, for no particular reason, starts to use his superior powers (he becomes telepathic and telekinetic), as well as his Tron-like tracksuit, for evil. This could have been corny fun (and, honestly, at its best, it is), but between the horribly dated CGI and the far too slow pace, it's a dud. The only really good thing about it is Fahey's performance. I do love his rampage, though, where he attacks people telekinetically with his lawnmower.

    If one can look past the visual-technology used to imply effects one can be pleasantly surprised as they find themselves questioning her sympathies for other people. This movie is a product of the 90s, and as such, may not be for all people. The idea of a full-grown man befriending a small boy might seem startling to us now, but in the 90s it was rather common (if I'm remembering this correctly). Billy Bob Thornton does a spectacular job playing a "mentally challenged" man in a small town where he is misunderstood...only a child can understand him. When given the chance to help his friend, we find ourselves questioning our sympathies for other people. Even though, due to certain physical conditions I currently find myself in, I usually feel sympathetic to people who face any kind of diversity, I do not know if I can fully agree with the path that Billy's character takes. ***SPOILER ALERT***MURDERING IS WRONG IN MOST INSTANCES BUT IT IS WRONG IN THIS INSTANCE? I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY!***END SPOILER ALERT*** And I don't believe that anyone is at liberty to say. It is not a question that can be so easily answered by our text books or our knowledge; One must contemplate the answer and decide for their own self (that is exactly what one must do, hopefully as soon as possible we should all do that). Somethings are just deeper than what is found in books. The movie feels very realistic. VERY sober. This movie wasn't made in the Hollywood spirit I have come to despise, but in a different spirit full of intellectual rigor. Though there is a child in this movie, I would not recommend this movie for children, at the end **SPOILER ALERT**Billy Bob Thornton's character murders someone**END SPOILER ALERT** And most people don't like their children watching that. The title of the film sounds simple (it's just an object!) and the character seem simple, but it is a very complicated movie. I hesitantly recommend.
