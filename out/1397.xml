    Much has been said regarding Bette Davis's outbreak performance in "Of Human Bondage" and I would certainly never argue it - her acting is magnificent. As is Leslie Howard's ....the two play off of each other perfectly - Howard as the shy, introverted and self-conscious "lonely man" and Davis as the brash, insensitive and malicious waitress. But it's the message of this movie that is so powerful, Davis and Howard are simply the messengers, albeit great ones. "Of Human Bondage" is the story of unrequited love, and hopeless bondage to another. Right from the outset, the relationship Between Philip and Mildred is doomed to failure, as is Howard's to Norah after Mildred leaves him. After all - what can one really offer someone whom they do not love? It really makes no difference whether it's Midred's abusive behavior towards Philip - who is basically obsessed with her, or Philip's cool (yet still very caring) indifference towards Norah, who adores him. The end result is the same. Perhaps this movie can only really speak to those that have been through it - but most of us probably have, as this is one of the great tragic human conditions. Person A loves person B, but they love person C, and so it goes. Forget the somewhat dated dialogue and sound quality, and watch a film that transcends most others with powerful acting and an even stronger message.

    Of Human Bondage is one of these old movies that fell into the public domain by lack of copyright renewal, therefore it is widely available and when I saw that it had both Bette Davis - who I enjoyed in All About Eve (1950) and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane (1962) with her characteristic gaze; and Leslie Howard who was in Gone with the Wind (1939) but also in the lesser known The Petrified Forest (1936), a friend and supporter of Humphrey Bogart he helped him rise to fame. In the film, Philip Carey is a young English man living in Paris hoping to become a painter. One night a man who he asked for advice tells Philip that he is talentless and needs to find another meaning to his life. Philip decides to become a doctor, however, a club foot severely impends on his self-esteem and confidence . When Philip goes to a caf&eacute; and sees the young flirtatious Mildred with another patron, he falls in love immediately. Mildred turns out to be really cold towards Philip and only uses him to go to the theater when it pleases her, while still seeing the man of the restaurant. Nonetheless, Philip decides to ask her to marry him but Mildred prevents it by saying she is already getting married. A few months later, Philip finds himself in a similar situation where a woman, Norah, loves him but he doesn't love her back. When Mildred reappears, broke, pregnant and alone, Philip can't help it and helps her, leaving Norah pondering about what happened to him. Philip and Mildred are unable to live together yet their paths will cross many times and again. The best thing in the movie has to be Bette Davis' performance of the cold and cynical Mildred. She is despicably perfect in her vanity. The main issue I had with the film is probably a very personal one, but it's the fact that a man falls desperately in love with a woman. I don't believe in such a thing. Now, I do believe a woman can take advantage of a man in this very same way, but Philip felt too at loss with his own feelings that I found it hard to believe--especially because of the fact that while Mildred is absent from Philip's life, he gladly partake in another woman's life, with or without shared feelings that remains to be seen. The dialogues are very clever, particularly the discourse which inspired the movie title about human bondage. I wish there were more to be analyzed from the line of work of Philip who goes from painting nude women to medical student to business man without particular choices, as if on railtracks. What pleased me the most was the character of Mildred, it was powerful and weak at the same time. A thin line that makes characters real. I liked: Strong female lead. Cyclic. Pride and vanity - a downfall. I disliked: Filming letters is annoying for the plot, I sometimes couldn't decipher them. The role of the child. Last scene with blocked out sound. 73/100 Not your typical romance, fortunately carried out by two grand actors of the 30's. Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com

    I'm well aware this was the role that made Bette Davis a star, and was the cause of the Academy allowing write-in nominations. As it is, Davis is fantastic, playing the awful Mildred with such intensity and effective ferociousness that it was no doubt something shocking to see a woman playing back in the day. She's truly incredible here and I think people will only know of the film because of her. But Leslie Howard provides the heart, and you definitely feel for him while still being frustrated with how much he pursues Mildred. This is definitely recommended in more ways than one, and it's a pity that it doesn't seem to be available that much to be able to see.

    A must watch film, I genuinely loved it. Easy to watch and get drawn into, not that dated at all, and a good story we can all relate to. Lots of reviews here waxing lyrical about Bette Davis' bawdy performance, and in general I go along with them, bar her pitiful attempt at a cockney accent. Its worse than Dick van Dykes (Mary Poppins) and I never thought I'd say that about anyone. Dick had a naiive comedic consistency in his americanised version. Bette is all over the place, mainly sounding like a posh girl pretending badly to be cockney and throwing in intonations I've never heard anyone speak. Very false and messed up, and irritating - but that is what she's portraying too, so it kinda works. She was either sheltered and made no attempt to get out and hear how people speak or she wouldn't have dared do what she did, or else she has no accent skills. Beyond the accent, yes, Bette makes the film funky and fun. The other actresses I think perform better, are more convincing character wise. Kay Johnson (Norah) is stiff upper lip British and understated, a mirror to Leslie Howards character, though lighter. Frances Dee (Sally) plays a young girl who accepts her place with a charm and a wisdom beyond her years - and is the heavenly beauty of the film. Watch, enjoy, and indulge in reminiscences of the unrequited loves in your life.

    Oh dear, how this film is showing its age: the endless fades, the wooden acting, the actors twenty years too old for their roles. Perhaps also it is that the very ideas and themes are showing their age. In a modern era, Leslie Howerd's character just seems wet rather than sensitive - you wish the guy would just grow a pair; the attitude to his club foot seems horribly unenlightened in an era where we say 'disabled', not 'cripple'; and Mildred's 'shocking' behaviour and ultimate fate seem laughable and judgemental. Bette Davis's Cockney accent is dreadful, poor lass, but having said that, her acting is the only good thing in this film: Leslie Howerd is dire and the only bit-parter worth his salt is Alan Hale: the characters of Harry, Sally, Sally's father and Norah are all poorly drawn and the film attempts to cover far too long a time span. Although I am a huge fan of vintage movies, including silents, I was able to watch this particular film only as a curiosity piece. Worth watching perhaps once for the costumes, furniture and Bette Davis's eyes.

    Even if I was not expecting a full take on the long and complex novel, as I knew it focused on the gloomy romance between Philip and Mildred, I was nevertheless disappointed by this movie. Having read the book, I had my ideas about Philip, the character played by Leslie Howard. After all, he is a rather complex character a shy, reserved boy, with an adventurous and daring side. Unfortunately, the script makes a complete wimp out of Philip and Leslie Howard certainly did not help with his very passive interpretation. Perhaps my total lack of appreciation for Howard contributed to the general feeling of disappointment about the movie. As mentioned by other reviewers, the movie comes alive only because of Bette Davis. She plays perfectly Mildred, the truly despicable maid. A cold, unfeeling, selfish, ignorant creature, so stupid to destroy the only man who loves her and herself along the way. Mildred is one of the most senselessly self-destructive characters ever. From the moment she enters the movie the audience  and Philip  are aware of what sort of creature she is. Her attitude is rude, she is vulgar and dismissive. It is almost impossible to understand what pushes Philip to pursue her, considering how she thrashes him. Also, given the cold approach of Howard, it is almost impossible to believe his character is so madly in love with her. The total lack of chemistry between Howard and Davis ruins the movie. Some of their scenes are cringe-inducing and involuntarily comic. The worst one involves Philip inviting one of his classmates to spend an evening with Mildred and him, and acting like a voyeur to their shameless flirting behavior. It is just impossible to watch without wondering what sort of man would stand that sort of humiliation. On a side note, it is interesting to note that Davis did not look particularly good at the beginning of the movie, with her classic 30's make-up (pencil thin, wide apart eyebrows which did nothing to make her bulging eyes look less protruding). However, her look improves during her descent to hell. Her hair is cut into a platinum bob; the smudged, smoky make-up around her eyes makes her face strangely modern; her whole features becomes less doll-like stylized. As I watched the DVD, I almost fell asleep towards the end, wondering how Scarlett O'Hara ever managed to be so passionately in love with Ashley, played by the very same Howard. . My apologies to Howard's fans, but I totally lack any appreciation for his skills. Bravo to Davis, as usual, but even she is not enough to make this movie a classic.

    Leslie Howard is only remembered today for marrying Scarlett in Gone With The Wind. Considering Howard would die in 1943 at age 50, that is not a surprise. He died as a casualty of the war. When you look at the work of his career, the legacy he left behind is impressive. He starred in 34 films, produced & directed several films and even found time to do some soundtracks to a couple of films, and wrote some films too. A busy 50 years. Here he is the main man with a problem that he had on Gone With The Wind too. He is in love with a waitress (Bette Davis) who does not love him. She runs off twice having a child with one of them, but when she comes back he welcomes her despite her indiscretions. Meanwhile, he gets attention from at least another beautiful woman but chooses to keep the living together relationship with the woman who spurned him. At one point in this film he utters to her, "I know that you will never love me," which is not unlike a line he makes to Scarlett 5 years later. Howard is excellent here and Davis playing the bad girl is great. She throws what you can only call a "hissy fit" at one point in the movie that is great acting. Even though she is back after 2 lovers, she destroys everything that Howard holds of value. In the long run, this comes back to bite her as she winds up on the streets with him. Based upon W. Somerset Maugham's novel, this film is a solid drama that holds up well considering when the film was made. Frances Dee & Kay Johnson are featured in the cast.

    This film is based on the story by British author, Somerset Maugham. The story begins with a struggling artist, Philip Carey (played wonderfully by the late Leslie Howard). He is advised that he's a mediocre artist. With that, he returns home to London and goes to medical school. There he becomes infatuated and in an unhealthy relationship with Mildred Rogers (played wonderfully by the late great Bette Davis). I'm not going into the controversy of why Bette Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for this performance. I know that she has done brilliantly in other film roles and would be awarded two Oscars in her lifetime. Anyway, the film really concentrates Philip Carey's character who was born with a club foot which makes him walk funny. His handicap is barely noticeable to the audience but the character feels it so self-consciously. His relationship with Mildred's character is complicated. The film is not about bondage at all which was not even discussed in that time. In fact, the film is about unrequited love, obsession, infatuation, and unhealthy relationships. It's still relevant to today's world.

    Such a disappointment after many readings of the W. Somerset Maugham's novel. The charm of the book's is main character, Philip, his struggles with poverty, a lonely childhood, fascination with Mildred, and other issues that are resolved beautifully by the author are totally missing from this movie. The movie begins with Philip as a full grown man. What motives are there for the viewer to understand his behavior? Nothing. The low-life played by Betty Davis is a huge turn-off. Gack! Who but a masochist could be attracted to her? The Sally of the movie is nothing like the Sally of the book. The books development of Philip and Sally's relationship has no development that is tender or shows Sally's character as in the book. Philip's internal dialog in the book as he ponders not living with Sally, is barely given account. So much of the book is missing this movie is a skeletal parody at best.

    Leslie Howard is only remembered today for marrying Scarlett in Gone With The Wind. Considering Howard would die in 1943 at age 50, that is not a surprise. He died as a casualty of the war. When you look at the work of his career, the legacy he left behind is impressive. He starred in 34 films, produced & directed several films and even found time to do some soundtracks to a couple of films, and wrote some films too. A busy 50 years. Here he is the main man with a problem that he had on Gone With The Wind too. He is in love with a waitress (Bette Davis) who does not love him. She runs off twice having a child with one of them, but when she comes back he welcomes her despite her indiscretions. Meanwhile, he gets attention from at least another beautiful woman but chooses to keep the living together relationship with the woman who spurned him. At one point in this film he utters to her, "I know that you will never love me," which is not unlike a line he makes to Scarlett 5 years later. Howard is excellent here and Davis playing the bad girl is great. She throws what you can only call a "hissy fit" at one point in the movie that is great acting. Even though she is back after 2 lovers, she destroys everything that Howard holds of value. In the long run, this comes back to bite her as she winds up on the streets with him. Based upon W. Somerset Maugham's novel, this film is a solid drama that holds up well considering when the film was made. Frances Dee & Kay Johnson are featured in the cast.

    This film is based on the story by British author, Somerset Maugham. The story begins with a struggling artist, Philip Carey (played wonderfully by the late Leslie Howard). He is advised that he's a mediocre artist. With that, he returns home to London and goes to medical school. There he becomes infatuated and in an unhealthy relationship with Mildred Rogers (played wonderfully by the late great Bette Davis). I'm not going into the controversy of why Bette Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for this performance. I know that she has done brilliantly in other film roles and would be awarded two Oscars in her lifetime. Anyway, the film really concentrates Philip Carey's character who was born with a club foot which makes him walk funny. His handicap is barely noticeable to the audience but the character feels it so self-consciously. His relationship with Mildred's character is complicated. The film is not about bondage at all which was not even discussed in that time. In fact, the film is about unrequited love, obsession, infatuation, and unhealthy relationships. It's still relevant to today's world.

    Such a disappointment after many readings of the W. Somerset Maugham's novel. The charm of the book's is main character, Philip, his struggles with poverty, a lonely childhood, fascination with Mildred, and other issues that are resolved beautifully by the author are totally missing from this movie. The movie begins with Philip as a full grown man. What motives are there for the viewer to understand his behavior? Nothing. The low-life played by Betty Davis is a huge turn-off. Gack! Who but a masochist could be attracted to her? The Sally of the movie is nothing like the Sally of the book. The books development of Philip and Sally's relationship has no development that is tender or shows Sally's character as in the book. Philip's internal dialog in the book as he ponders not living with Sally, is barely given account. So much of the book is missing this movie is a skeletal parody at best.

    Much has been said regarding Bette Davis's outbreak performance in "Of Human Bondage" and I would certainly never argue it - her acting is magnificent. As is Leslie Howard's ....the two play off of each other perfectly - Howard as the shy, introverted and self-conscious "lonely man" and Davis as the brash, insensitive and malicious waitress. But it's the message of this movie that is so powerful, Davis and Howard are simply the messengers, albeit great ones. "Of Human Bondage" is the story of unrequited love, and hopeless bondage to another. Right from the outset, the relationship Between Philip and Mildred is doomed to failure, as is Howard's to Norah after Mildred leaves him. After all - what can one really offer someone whom they do not love? It really makes no difference whether it's Midred's abusive behavior towards Philip - who is basically obsessed with her, or Philip's cool (yet still very caring) indifference towards Norah, who adores him. The end result is the same. Perhaps this movie can only really speak to those that have been through it - but most of us probably have, as this is one of the great tragic human conditions. Person A loves person B, but they love person C, and so it goes. Forget the somewhat dated dialogue and sound quality, and watch a film that transcends most others with powerful acting and an even stronger message.

    Of Human Bondage is one of these old movies that fell into the public domain by lack of copyright renewal, therefore it is widely available and when I saw that it had both Bette Davis - who I enjoyed in All About Eve (1950) and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane (1962) with her characteristic gaze; and Leslie Howard who was in Gone with the Wind (1939) but also in the lesser known The Petrified Forest (1936), a friend and supporter of Humphrey Bogart he helped him rise to fame. In the film, Philip Carey is a young English man living in Paris hoping to become a painter. One night a man who he asked for advice tells Philip that he is talentless and needs to find another meaning to his life. Philip decides to become a doctor, however, a club foot severely impends on his self-esteem and confidence . When Philip goes to a caf&eacute; and sees the young flirtatious Mildred with another patron, he falls in love immediately. Mildred turns out to be really cold towards Philip and only uses him to go to the theater when it pleases her, while still seeing the man of the restaurant. Nonetheless, Philip decides to ask her to marry him but Mildred prevents it by saying she is already getting married. A few months later, Philip finds himself in a similar situation where a woman, Norah, loves him but he doesn't love her back. When Mildred reappears, broke, pregnant and alone, Philip can't help it and helps her, leaving Norah pondering about what happened to him. Philip and Mildred are unable to live together yet their paths will cross many times and again. The best thing in the movie has to be Bette Davis' performance of the cold and cynical Mildred. She is despicably perfect in her vanity. The main issue I had with the film is probably a very personal one, but it's the fact that a man falls desperately in love with a woman. I don't believe in such a thing. Now, I do believe a woman can take advantage of a man in this very same way, but Philip felt too at loss with his own feelings that I found it hard to believe--especially because of the fact that while Mildred is absent from Philip's life, he gladly partake in another woman's life, with or without shared feelings that remains to be seen. The dialogues are very clever, particularly the discourse which inspired the movie title about human bondage. I wish there were more to be analyzed from the line of work of Philip who goes from painting nude women to medical student to business man without particular choices, as if on railtracks. What pleased me the most was the character of Mildred, it was powerful and weak at the same time. A thin line that makes characters real. I liked: Strong female lead. Cyclic. Pride and vanity - a downfall. I disliked: Filming letters is annoying for the plot, I sometimes couldn't decipher them. The role of the child. Last scene with blocked out sound. 73/100 Not your typical romance, fortunately carried out by two grand actors of the 30's. Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com

    I'm well aware this was the role that made Bette Davis a star, and was the cause of the Academy allowing write-in nominations. As it is, Davis is fantastic, playing the awful Mildred with such intensity and effective ferociousness that it was no doubt something shocking to see a woman playing back in the day. She's truly incredible here and I think people will only know of the film because of her. But Leslie Howard provides the heart, and you definitely feel for him while still being frustrated with how much he pursues Mildred. This is definitely recommended in more ways than one, and it's a pity that it doesn't seem to be available that much to be able to see.

    A must watch film, I genuinely loved it. Easy to watch and get drawn into, not that dated at all, and a good story we can all relate to. Lots of reviews here waxing lyrical about Bette Davis' bawdy performance, and in general I go along with them, bar her pitiful attempt at a cockney accent. Its worse than Dick van Dykes (Mary Poppins) and I never thought I'd say that about anyone. Dick had a naiive comedic consistency in his americanised version. Bette is all over the place, mainly sounding like a posh girl pretending badly to be cockney and throwing in intonations I've never heard anyone speak. Very false and messed up, and irritating - but that is what she's portraying too, so it kinda works. She was either sheltered and made no attempt to get out and hear how people speak or she wouldn't have dared do what she did, or else she has no accent skills. Beyond the accent, yes, Bette makes the film funky and fun. The other actresses I think perform better, are more convincing character wise. Kay Johnson (Norah) is stiff upper lip British and understated, a mirror to Leslie Howards character, though lighter. Frances Dee (Sally) plays a young girl who accepts her place with a charm and a wisdom beyond her years - and is the heavenly beauty of the film. Watch, enjoy, and indulge in reminiscences of the unrequited loves in your life.

    Oh dear, how this film is showing its age: the endless fades, the wooden acting, the actors twenty years too old for their roles. Perhaps also it is that the very ideas and themes are showing their age. In a modern era, Leslie Howerd's character just seems wet rather than sensitive - you wish the guy would just grow a pair; the attitude to his club foot seems horribly unenlightened in an era where we say 'disabled', not 'cripple'; and Mildred's 'shocking' behaviour and ultimate fate seem laughable and judgemental. Bette Davis's Cockney accent is dreadful, poor lass, but having said that, her acting is the only good thing in this film: Leslie Howerd is dire and the only bit-parter worth his salt is Alan Hale: the characters of Harry, Sally, Sally's father and Norah are all poorly drawn and the film attempts to cover far too long a time span. Although I am a huge fan of vintage movies, including silents, I was able to watch this particular film only as a curiosity piece. Worth watching perhaps once for the costumes, furniture and Bette Davis's eyes.

    After failing as an artist, a club-footed man becomes a doctor and becomes romantically obsessed with a waitress. This adaptation of the Maugham story is little more than a dreary soap opera. The filmmakers have done nothing to raise it to anything more than a static, dull drama. Although the doctor is supposed to be a depressed character, Howard is still lackluster in the role. Davis fares better in the star-making role of the conniving waitress, a part she had to fight for after a series of forgettable films. Sporting an English accent, she does chew the scenery but also provides about the only reason for watching this lackluster film.

    Even if I was not expecting a full take on the long and complex novel, as I knew it focused on the gloomy romance between Philip and Mildred, I was nevertheless disappointed by this movie. Having read the book, I had my ideas about Philip, the character played by Leslie Howard. After all, he is a rather complex character a shy, reserved boy, with an adventurous and daring side. Unfortunately, the script makes a complete wimp out of Philip and Leslie Howard certainly did not help with his very passive interpretation. Perhaps my total lack of appreciation for Howard contributed to the general feeling of disappointment about the movie. As mentioned by other reviewers, the movie comes alive only because of Bette Davis. She plays perfectly Mildred, the truly despicable maid. A cold, unfeeling, selfish, ignorant creature, so stupid to destroy the only man who loves her and herself along the way. Mildred is one of the most senselessly self-destructive characters ever. From the moment she enters the movie the audience  and Philip  are aware of what sort of creature she is. Her attitude is rude, she is vulgar and dismissive. It is almost impossible to understand what pushes Philip to pursue her, considering how she thrashes him. Also, given the cold approach of Howard, it is almost impossible to believe his character is so madly in love with her. The total lack of chemistry between Howard and Davis ruins the movie. Some of their scenes are cringe-inducing and involuntarily comic. The worst one involves Philip inviting one of his classmates to spend an evening with Mildred and him, and acting like a voyeur to their shameless flirting behavior. It is just impossible to watch without wondering what sort of man would stand that sort of humiliation. On a side note, it is interesting to note that Davis did not look particularly good at the beginning of the movie, with her classic 30's make-up (pencil thin, wide apart eyebrows which did nothing to make her bulging eyes look less protruding). However, her look improves during her descent to hell. Her hair is cut into a platinum bob; the smudged, smoky make-up around her eyes makes her face strangely modern; her whole features becomes less doll-like stylized. As I watched the DVD, I almost fell asleep towards the end, wondering how Scarlett O'Hara ever managed to be so passionately in love with Ashley, played by the very same Howard. . My apologies to Howard's fans, but I totally lack any appreciation for his skills. Bravo to Davis, as usual, but even she is not enough to make this movie a classic.

A cold, unfeeling, selfish, ignorant creature, so stupid to destroy the only man who loves her and herself along the way. Mildred is one of the most senselessly self-destructive characters ever. From the moment she enters the movie the audience  and Philip  are aware of what sort of creature she is. Her attitude is rude, she is vulgar and dismissive. It is almost impossible to understand what pushes Philip to pursue her, considering how she thrashes him. Also, given the cold approach of Howard, it is almost impossible to believe his character is so madly in love with her. The total lack of chemistry between Howard and Davis ruins the movie. Some of their scenes are cringe-inducing and involuntarily comic. The worst one involves Philip inviting one of his classmates to spend an evening with Mildred and him, and acting like a voyeur to their shameless flirting behavior. It is just impossible to watch without wondering what sort of man would stand that sort of humiliation. On a side note, it is interesting to note that Davis did not look particularly good at the beginning of the movie, with her classic 30's make-up (pencil thin, wide apart eyebrows which did nothing to make her bulging eyes look less protruding). However, her look improves during her descent to hell. Her hair is cut into a platinum bob; the smudged, smoky make-up around her eyes makes her face strangely modern; her whole features becomes less doll-like stylized. As I watched the DVD, I almost fell asleep towards the end, wondering how Scarlett O'Hara ever managed to be so passionately in love with Ashley, played by the very same Howard. . My apologies to Howard's fans, but I totally lack any appreciation for his skills. Bravo to Davis, as usual, but even she is not enough to make this movie a classic.

    Leslie Howard is only remembered today for marrying Scarlett in Gone With The Wind. Considering Howard would die in 1943 at age 50, that is not a surprise. He died as a casualty of the war. When you look at the work of his career, the legacy he left behind is impressive. He starred in 34 films, produced & directed several films and even found time to do some soundtracks to a couple of films, and wrote some films too. A busy 50 years. Here he is the main man with a problem that he had on Gone With The Wind too. He is in love with a waitress (Bette Davis) who does not love him. She runs off twice having a child with one of them, but when she comes back he welcomes her despite her indiscretions. Meanwhile, he gets attention from at least another beautiful woman but chooses to keep the living together relationship with the woman who spurned him. At one point in this film he utters to her, "I know that you will never love me," which is not unlike a line he makes to Scarlett 5 years later. Howard is excellent here and Davis playing the bad girl is great. She throws what you can only call a "hissy fit" at one point in the movie that is great acting. Even though she is back after 2 lovers, she destroys everything that Howard holds of value. In the long run, this comes back to bite her as she winds up on the streets with him. Based upon W. Somerset Maugham's novel, this film is a solid drama that holds up well considering when the film was made. Frances Dee & Kay Johnson are featured in the cast.

    This film is based on the story by British author, Somerset Maugham. The story begins with a struggling artist, Philip Carey (played wonderfully by the late Leslie Howard). He is advised that he's a mediocre artist. With that, he returns home to London and goes to medical school. There he becomes infatuated and in an unhealthy relationship with Mildred Rogers (played wonderfully by the late great Bette Davis). I'm not going into the controversy of why Bette Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for this performance. I know that she has done brilliantly in other film roles and would be awarded two Oscars in her lifetime. Anyway, the film really concentrates Philip Carey's character who was born with a club foot which makes him walk funny. His handicap is barely noticeable to the audience but the character feels it so self-consciously. His relationship with Mildred's character is complicated. The film is not about bondage at all which was not even discussed in that time. In fact, the film is about unrequited love, obsession, infatuation, and unhealthy relationships. It's still relevant to today's world.

    Such a disappointment after many readings of the W. Somerset Maugham's novel. The charm of the book's is main character, Philip, his struggles with poverty, a lonely childhood, fascination with Mildred, and other issues that are resolved beautifully by the author are totally missing from this movie. The movie begins with Philip as a full grown man. What motives are there for the viewer to understand his behavior? Nothing. The low-life played by Betty Davis is a huge turn-off. Gack! Who but a masochist could be attracted to her? The Sally of the movie is nothing like the Sally of the book. The books development of Philip and Sally's relationship has no development that is tender or shows Sally's character as in the book. Philip's internal dialog in the book as he ponders not living with Sally, is barely given account. So much of the book is missing this movie is a skeletal parody at best.

    Much has been said regarding Bette Davis's outbreak performance in "Of Human Bondage" and I would certainly never argue it - her acting is magnificent. As is Leslie Howard's ....the two play off of each other perfectly - Howard as the shy, introverted and self-conscious "lonely man" and Davis as the brash, insensitive and malicious waitress. But it's the message of this movie that is so powerful, Davis and Howard are simply the messengers, albeit great ones. "Of Human Bondage" is the story of unrequited love, and hopeless bondage to another. Right from the outset, the relationship Between Philip and Mildred is doomed to failure, as is Howard's to Norah after Mildred leaves him. After all - what can one really offer someone whom they do not love? It really makes no difference whether it's Midred's abusive behavior towards Philip - who is basically obsessed with her, or Philip's cool (yet still very caring) indifference towards Norah, who adores him. The end result is the same. Perhaps this movie can only really speak to those that have been through it - but most of us probably have, as this is one of the great tragic human conditions. Person A loves person B, but they love person C, and so it goes. Forget the somewhat dated dialogue and sound quality, and watch a film that transcends most others with powerful acting and an even stronger message.

    Of Human Bondage is one of these old movies that fell into the public domain by lack of copyright renewal, therefore it is widely available and when I saw that it had both Bette Davis - who I enjoyed in All About Eve (1950) and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane (1962) with her characteristic gaze; and Leslie Howard who was in Gone with the Wind (1939) but also in the lesser known The Petrified Forest (1936), a friend and supporter of Humphrey Bogart he helped him rise to fame. In the film, Philip Carey is a young English man living in Paris hoping to become a painter. One night a man who he asked for advice tells Philip that he is talentless and needs to find another meaning to his life. Philip decides to become a doctor, however, a club foot severely impends on his self-esteem and confidence . When Philip goes to a caf&eacute; and sees the young flirtatious Mildred with another patron, he falls in love immediately. Mildred turns out to be really cold towards Philip and only uses him to go to the theater when it pleases her, while still seeing the man of the restaurant. Nonetheless, Philip decides to ask her to marry him but Mildred prevents it by saying she is already getting married. A few months later, Philip finds himself in a similar situation where a woman, Norah, loves him but he doesn't love her back. When Mildred reappears, broke, pregnant and alone, Philip can't help it and helps her, leaving Norah pondering about what happened to him. Philip and Mildred are unable to live together yet their paths will cross many times and again. The best thing in the movie has to be Bette Davis' performance of the cold and cynical Mildred. She is despicably perfect in her vanity. The main issue I had with the film is probably a very personal one, but it's the fact that a man falls desperately in love with a woman. I don't believe in such a thing. Now, I do believe a woman can take advantage of a man in this very same way, but Philip felt too at loss with his own feelings that I found it hard to believe--especially because of the fact that while Mildred is absent from Philip's life, he gladly partake in another woman's life, with or without shared feelings that remains to be seen. The dialogues are very clever, particularly the discourse which inspired the movie title about human bondage. I wish there were more to be analyzed from the line of work of Philip who goes from painting nude women to medical student to business man without particular choices, as if on railtracks. What pleased me the most was the character of Mildred, it was powerful and weak at the same time. A thin line that makes characters real. I liked: Strong female lead. Cyclic. Pride and vanity - a downfall. I disliked: Filming letters is annoying for the plot, I sometimes couldn't decipher them. The role of the child. Last scene with blocked out sound. 73/100 Not your typical romance, fortunately carried out by two grand actors of the 30's. Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com

    I'm well aware this was the role that made Bette Davis a star, and was the cause of the Academy allowing write-in nominations. As it is, Davis is fantastic, playing the awful Mildred with such intensity and effective ferociousness that it was no doubt something shocking to see a woman playing back in the day. She's truly incredible here and I think people will only know of the film because of her. But Leslie Howard provides the heart, and you definitely feel for him while still being frustrated with how much he pursues Mildred. This is definitely recommended in more ways than one, and it's a pity that it doesn't seem to be available that much to be able to see.

    A must watch film, I genuinely loved it. Easy to watch and get drawn into, not that dated at all, and a good story we can all relate to. Lots of reviews here waxing lyrical about Bette Davis' bawdy performance, and in general I go along with them, bar her pitiful attempt at a cockney accent. Its worse than Dick van Dykes (Mary Poppins) and I never thought I'd say that about anyone. Dick had a naiive comedic consistency in his americanised version. Bette is all over the place, mainly sounding like a posh girl pretending badly to be cockney and throwing in intonations I've never heard anyone speak. Very false and messed up, and irritating - but that is what she's portraying too, so it kinda works. She was either sheltered and made no attempt to get out and hear how people speak or she wouldn't have dared do what she did, or else she has no accent skills. Beyond the accent, yes, Bette makes the film funky and fun. The other actresses I think perform better, are more convincing character wise. Kay Johnson (Norah) is stiff upper lip British and understated, a mirror to Leslie Howards character, though lighter. Frances Dee (Sally) plays a young girl who accepts her place with a charm and a wisdom beyond her years - and is the heavenly beauty of the film. Watch, enjoy, and indulge in reminiscences of the unrequited loves in your life.

    Oh dear, how this film is showing its age: the endless fades, the wooden acting, the actors twenty years too old for their roles. Perhaps also it is that the very ideas and themes are showing their age. In a modern era, Leslie Howerd's character just seems wet rather than sensitive - you wish the guy would just grow a pair; the attitude to his club foot seems horribly unenlightened in an era where we say 'disabled', not 'cripple'; and Mildred's 'shocking' behaviour and ultimate fate seem laughable and judgemental. Bette Davis's Cockney accent is dreadful, poor lass, but having said that, her acting is the only good thing in this film: Leslie Howerd is dire and the only bit-parter worth his salt is Alan Hale: the characters of Harry, Sally, Sally's father and Norah are all poorly drawn and the film attempts to cover far too long a time span. Although I am a huge fan of vintage movies, including silents, I was able to watch this particular film only as a curiosity piece. Worth watching perhaps once for the costumes, furniture and Bette Davis's eyes.

    After failing as an artist, a club-footed man becomes a doctor and becomes romantically obsessed with a waitress. This adaptation of the Maugham story is little more than a dreary soap opera. The filmmakers have done nothing to raise it to anything more than a static, dull drama. Although the doctor is supposed to be a depressed character, Howard is still lackluster in the role. Davis fares better in the star-making role of the conniving waitress, a part she had to fight for after a series of forgettable films. Sporting an English accent, she does chew the scenery but also provides about the only reason for watching this lackluster film.

    Even if I was not expecting a full take on the long and complex novel, as I knew it focused on the gloomy romance between Philip and Mildred, I was nevertheless disappointed by this movie. Having read the book, I had my ideas about Philip, the character played by Leslie Howard. After all, he is a rather complex character a shy, reserved boy, with an adventurous and daring side. Unfortunately, the script makes a complete wimp out of Philip and Leslie Howard certainly did not help with his very passive interpretation. Perhaps my total lack of appreciation for Howard contributed to the general feeling of disappointment about the movie. As mentioned by other reviewers, the movie comes alive only because of Bette Davis. She plays perfectly Mildred, the truly despicable maid. A cold, unfeeling, selfish, ignorant creature, so stupid to destroy the only man who loves her and herself along the way. Mildred is one of the most senselessly self-destructive characters ever. From the moment she enters the movie the audience  and Philip  are aware of what sort of creature she is. Her attitude is rude, she is vulgar and dismissive. It is almost impossible to understand what pushes Philip to pursue her, considering how she thrashes him. Also, given the cold approach of Howard, it is almost impossible to believe his character is so madly in love with her. The total lack of chemistry between Howard and Davis ruins the movie. Some of their scenes are cringe-inducing and involuntarily comic. The worst one involves Philip inviting one of his classmates to spend an evening with Mildred and him, and acting like a voyeur to their shameless flirting behavior. It is just impossible to watch without wondering what sort of man would stand that sort of humiliation. On a side note, it is interesting to note that Davis did not look particularly good at the beginning of the movie, with her classic 30's make-up (pencil thin, wide apart eyebrows which did nothing to make her bulging eyes look less protruding). However, her look improves during her descent to hell. Her hair is cut into a platinum bob; the smudged, smoky make-up around her eyes makes her face strangely modern; her whole features becomes less doll-like stylized. As I watched the DVD, I almost fell asleep towards the end, wondering how Scarlett O'Hara ever managed to be so passionately in love with Ashley, played by the very same Howard. . My apologies to Howard's fans, but I totally lack any appreciation for his skills. Bravo to Davis, as usual, but even she is not enough to make this movie a classic.

    Oh dear, how this film is showing its age: the endless fades, the wooden acting, the actors twenty years too old for their roles. Perhaps also it is that the very ideas and themes are showing their age. In a modern era, Leslie Howerd's character just seems wet rather than sensitive - you wish the guy would just grow a pair; the attitude to his club foot seems horribly unenlightened in an era where we say 'disabled', not 'cripple'; and Mildred's 'shocking' behaviour and ultimate fate seem laughable and judgemental. Bette Davis's Cockney accent is dreadful, poor lass, but having said that, her acting is the only good thing in this film: Leslie Howerd is dire and the only bit-parter worth his salt is Alan Hale: the characters of Harry, Sally, Sally's father and Norah are all poorly drawn and the film attempts to cover far too long a time span. Although I am a huge fan of vintage movies, including silents, I was able to watch this particular film only as a curiosity piece. Worth watching perhaps once for the costumes, furniture and Bette Davis's eyes.

    After failing as an artist, a club-footed man becomes a doctor and becomes romantically obsessed with a waitress. This adaptation of the Maugham story is little more than a dreary soap opera. The filmmakers have done nothing to raise it to anything more than a static, dull drama. Although the doctor is supposed to be a depressed character, Howard is still lackluster in the role. Davis fares better in the star-making role of the conniving waitress, a part she had to fight for after a series of forgettable films. Sporting an English accent, she does chew the scenery but also provides about the only reason for watching this lackluster film.

    Even if I was not expecting a full take on the long and complex novel, as I knew it focused on the gloomy romance between Philip and Mildred, I was nevertheless disappointed by this movie. Having read the book, I had my ideas about Philip, the character played by Leslie Howard. After all, he is a rather complex character a shy, reserved boy, with an adventurous and daring side. Unfortunately, the script makes a complete wimp out of Philip and Leslie Howard certainly did not help with his very passive interpretation. Perhaps my total lack of appreciation for Howard contributed to the general feeling of disappointment about the movie. As mentioned by other reviewers, the movie comes alive only because of Bette Davis. She plays perfectly Mildred, the truly despicable maid. A cold, unfeeling, selfish, ignorant creature, so stupid to destroy the only man who loves her and herself along the way. Mildred is one of the most senselessly self-destructive characters ever. From the moment she enters the movie the audience  and Philip  are aware of what sort of creature she is. Her attitude is rude, she is vulgar and dismissive. It is almost impossible to understand what pushes Philip to pursue her, considering how she thrashes him. Also, given the cold approach of Howard, it is almost impossible to believe his character is so madly in love with her. The total lack of chemistry between Howard and Davis ruins the movie. Some of their scenes are cringe-inducing and involuntarily comic. The worst one involves Philip inviting one of his classmates to spend an evening with Mildred and him, and acting like a voyeur to their shameless flirting behavior. It is just impossible to watch without wondering what sort of man would stand that sort of humiliation. On a side note, it is interesting to note that Davis did not look particularly good at the beginning of the movie, with her classic 30's make-up (pencil thin, wide apart eyebrows which did nothing to make her bulging eyes look less protruding). However, her look improves during her descent to hell. Her hair is cut into a platinum bob; the smudged, smoky make-up around her eyes makes her face strangely modern; her whole features becomes less doll-like stylized. As I watched the DVD, I almost fell asleep towards the end, wondering how Scarlett O'Hara ever managed to be so passionately in love with Ashley, played by the very same Howard. . My apologies to Howard's fans, but I totally lack any appreciation for his skills. Bravo to Davis, as usual, but even she is not enough to make this movie a classic.

    Leslie Howard is only remembered today for marrying Scarlett in Gone With The Wind. Considering Howard would die in 1943 at age 50, that is not a surprise. He died as a casualty of the war. When you look at the work of his career, the legacy he left behind is impressive. He starred in 34 films, produced & directed several films and even found time to do some soundtracks to a couple of films, and wrote some films too. A busy 50 years. Here he is the main man with a problem that he had on Gone With The Wind too. He is in love with a waitress (Bette Davis) who does not love him. She runs off twice having a child with one of them, but when she comes back he welcomes her despite her indiscretions. Meanwhile, he gets attention from at least another beautiful woman but chooses to keep the living together relationship with the woman who spurned him. At one point in this film he utters to her, "I know that you will never love me," which is not unlike a line he makes to Scarlett 5 years later. Howard is excellent here and Davis playing the bad girl is great. She throws what you can only call a "hissy fit" at one point in the movie that is great acting. Even though she is back after 2 lovers, she destroys everything that Howard holds of value. In the long run, this comes back to bite her as she winds up on the streets with him. Based upon W. Somerset Maugham's novel, this film is a solid drama that holds up well considering when the film was made. Frances Dee & Kay Johnson are featured in the cast.

    This film is based on the story by British author, Somerset Maugham. The story begins with a struggling artist, Philip Carey (played wonderfully by the late Leslie Howard). He is advised that he's a mediocre artist. With that, he returns home to London and goes to medical school. There he becomes infatuated and in an unhealthy relationship with Mildred Rogers (played wonderfully by the late great Bette Davis). I'm not going into the controversy of why Bette Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for this performance. I know that she has done brilliantly in other film roles and would be awarded two Oscars in her lifetime. Anyway, the film really concentrates Philip Carey's character who was born with a club foot which makes him walk funny. His handicap is barely noticeable to the audience but the character feels it so self-consciously. His relationship with Mildred's character is complicated. The film is not about bondage at all which was not even discussed in that time. In fact, the film is about unrequited love, obsession, infatuation, and unhealthy relationships. It's still relevant to today's world.

    Such a disappointment after many readings of the W. Somerset Maugham's novel. The charm of the book's is main character, Philip, his struggles with poverty, a lonely childhood, fascination with Mildred, and other issues that are resolved beautifully by the author are totally missing from this movie. The movie begins with Philip as a full grown man. What motives are there for the viewer to understand his behavior? Nothing. The low-life played by Betty Davis is a huge turn-off. Gack! Who but a masochist could be attracted to her? The Sally of the movie is nothing like the Sally of the book. The books development of Philip and Sally's relationship has no development that is tender or shows Sally's character as in the book. Philip's internal dialog in the book as he ponders not living with Sally, is barely given account. So much of the book is missing this movie is a skeletal parody at best.

    Much has been said regarding Bette Davis's outbreak performance in "Of Human Bondage" and I would certainly never argue it - her acting is magnificent. As is Leslie Howard's ....the two play off of each other perfectly - Howard as the shy, introverted and self-conscious "lonely man" and Davis as the brash, insensitive and malicious waitress. But it's the message of this movie that is so powerful, Davis and Howard are simply the messengers, albeit great ones. "Of Human Bondage" is the story of unrequited love, and hopeless bondage to another. Right from the outset, the relationship Between Philip and Mildred is doomed to failure, as is Howard's to Norah after Mildred leaves him. After all - what can one really offer someone whom they do not love? It really makes no difference whether it's Midred's abusive behavior towards Philip - who is basically obsessed with her, or Philip's cool (yet still very caring) indifference towards Norah, who adores him. The end result is the same. Perhaps this movie can only really speak to those that have been through it - but most of us probably have, as this is one of the great tragic human conditions. Person A loves person B, but they love person C, and so it goes. Forget the somewhat dated dialogue and sound quality, and watch a film that transcends most others with powerful acting and an even stronger message.

    Of Human Bondage is one of these old movies that fell into the public domain by lack of copyright renewal, therefore it is widely available and when I saw that it had both Bette Davis - who I enjoyed in All About Eve (1950) and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane (1962) with her characteristic gaze; and Leslie Howard who was in Gone with the Wind (1939) but also in the lesser known The Petrified Forest (1936), a friend and supporter of Humphrey Bogart he helped him rise to fame. In the film, Philip Carey is a young English man living in Paris hoping to become a painter. One night a man who he asked for advice tells Philip that he is talentless and needs to find another meaning to his life. Philip decides to become a doctor, however, a club foot severely impends on his self-esteem and confidence . When Philip goes to a caf&eacute; and sees the young flirtatious Mildred with another patron, he falls in love immediately. Mildred turns out to be really cold towards Philip and only uses him to go to the theater when it pleases her, while still seeing the man of the restaurant. Nonetheless, Philip decides to ask her to marry him but Mildred prevents it by saying she is already getting married. A few months later, Philip finds himself in a similar situation where a woman, Norah, loves him but he doesn't love her back. When Mildred reappears, broke, pregnant and alone, Philip can't help it and helps her, leaving Norah pondering about what happened to him. Philip and Mildred are unable to live together yet their paths will cross many times and again. The best thing in the movie has to be Bette Davis' performance of the cold and cynical Mildred. She is despicably perfect in her vanity. The main issue I had with the film is probably a very personal one, but it's the fact that a man falls desperately in love with a woman. I don't believe in such a thing. Now, I do believe a woman can take advantage of a man in this very same way, but Philip felt too at loss with his own feelings that I found it hard to believe--especially because of the fact that while Mildred is absent from Philip's life, he gladly partake in another woman's life, with or without shared feelings that remains to be seen. The dialogues are very clever, particularly the discourse which inspired the movie title about human bondage. I wish there were more to be analyzed from the line of work of Philip who goes from painting nude women to medical student to business man without particular choices, as if on railtracks. What pleased me the most was the character of Mildred, it was powerful and weak at the same time. A thin line that makes characters real. I liked: Strong female lead. Cyclic. Pride and vanity - a downfall. I disliked: Filming letters is annoying for the plot, I sometimes couldn't decipher them. The role of the child. Last scene with blocked out sound. 73/100 Not your typical romance, fortunately carried out by two grand actors of the 30's. Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com

    I'm well aware this was the role that made Bette Davis a star, and was the cause of the Academy allowing write-in nominations. As it is, Davis is fantastic, playing the awful Mildred with such intensity and effective ferociousness that it was no doubt something shocking to see a woman playing back in the day. She's truly incredible here and I think people will only know of the film because of her. But Leslie Howard provides the heart, and you definitely feel for him while still being frustrated with how much he pursues Mildred. This is definitely recommended in more ways than one, and it's a pity that it doesn't seem to be available that much to be able to see.

    A must watch film, I genuinely loved it. Easy to watch and get drawn into, not that dated at all, and a good story we can all relate to. Lots of reviews here waxing lyrical about Bette Davis' bawdy performance, and in general I go along with them, bar her pitiful attempt at a cockney accent. Its worse than Dick van Dykes (Mary Poppins) and I never thought I'd say that about anyone. Dick had a naiive comedic consistency in his americanised version. Bette is all over the place, mainly sounding like a posh girl pretending badly to be cockney and throwing in intonations I've never heard anyone speak. Very false and messed up, and irritating - but that is what she's portraying too, so it kinda works. She was either sheltered and made no attempt to get out and hear how people speak or she wouldn't have dared do what she did, or else she has no accent skills. Beyond the accent, yes, Bette makes the film funky and fun. The other actresses I think perform better, are more convincing character wise. Kay Johnson (Norah) is stiff upper lip British and understated, a mirror to Leslie Howards character, though lighter. Frances Dee (Sally) plays a young girl who accepts her place with a charm and a wisdom beyond her years - and is the heavenly beauty of the film. Watch, enjoy, and indulge in reminiscences of the unrequited loves in your life.

    Oh dear, how this film is showing its age: the endless fades, the wooden acting, the actors twenty years too old for their roles. Perhaps also it is that the very ideas and themes are showing their age. In a modern era, Leslie Howerd's character just seems wet rather than sensitive - you wish the guy would just grow a pair; the attitude to his club foot seems horribly unenlightened in an era where we say 'disabled', not 'cripple'; and Mildred's 'shocking' behaviour and ultimate fate seem laughable and judgemental. Bette Davis's Cockney accent is dreadful, poor lass, but having said that, her acting is the only good thing in this film: Leslie Howerd is dire and the only bit-parter worth his salt is Alan Hale: the characters of Harry, Sally, Sally's father and Norah are all poorly drawn and the film attempts to cover far too long a time span. Although I am a huge fan of vintage movies, including silents, I was able to watch this particular film only as a curiosity piece. Worth watching perhaps once for the costumes, furniture and Bette Davis's eyes.

The filmmakers have done nothing to raise it to anything more than a static, dull drama. Although the doctor is supposed to be a depressed character, Howard is still lackluster in the role. Davis fares better in the star-making role of the conniving waitress, a part she had to fight for after a series of forgettable films. Sporting an English accent, she does chew the scenery but also provides about the only reason for watching this lackluster film.

Her hair is cut into a platinum bob; the smudged, smoky make-up around her eyes makes her face strangely modern; her whole features becomes less doll-like stylized.

Its worse than Dick van Dykes (Mary Poppins) and I never thought I'd say that about anyone. Dick had a naiive comedic consistency in his americanised version. Bette is all over the place, mainly sounding like a posh girl pretending badly to be cockney and throwing in intonations I've never heard anyone speak. Very false and messed up, and irritating - but that is what she's portraying too, so it kinda works. She was either sheltered and made no attempt to get out and hear how people speak or she wouldn't have dared do what she did, or else she has no accent skills. Beyond the accent, yes, Bette makes the film funky and fun. The other actresses I think perform better, are more convincing character wise. Kay Johnson (Norah) is stiff upper lip British and understated, a mirror to Leslie Howards character, though lighter. Frances Dee (Sally) plays a young girl who accepts her place with a charm and a wisdom beyond her years - and is the heavenly beauty of the film. Watch, enjoy, and indulge in reminiscences of the unrequited loves in your life.

    Oh dear, how this film is showing its age: the endless fades, the wooden acting, the actors twenty years too old for their roles. Perhaps also it is that the very ideas and themes are showing their age. In a modern era, Leslie Howerd's character just seems wet rather than sensitive - you wish the guy would just grow a pair; the attitude to his club foot seems horribly unenlightened in an era where we say 'disabled', not 'cripple'; and Mildred's 'shocking' behaviour and ultimate fate seem laughable and judgemental. Bette Davis's Cockney accent is dreadful, poor lass, but having said that, her acting is the only good thing in this film: Leslie Howerd is dire and the only bit-parter worth his salt is Alan Hale: the characters of Harry, Sally, Sally's father and Norah are all poorly drawn and the film attempts to cover far too long a time span. Although I am a huge fan of vintage movies, including silents, I was able to watch this particular film only as a curiosity piece. Worth watching perhaps once for the costumes, furniture and Bette Davis's eyes.

    After failing as an artist, a club-footed man becomes a doctor and becomes romantically obsessed with a waitress. This adaptation of the Maugham story is little more than a dreary soap opera. The filmmakers have done nothing to raise it to anything more than a static, dull drama. Although the doctor is supposed to be a depressed character, Howard is still lackluster in the role. Davis fares better in the star-making role of the conniving waitress, a part she had to fight for after a series of forgettable films. Sporting an English accent, she does chew the scenery but also provides about the only reason for watching this lackluster film.

    Even if I was not expecting a full take on the long and complex novel, as I knew it focused on the gloomy romance between Philip and Mildred, I was nevertheless disappointed by this movie. Having read the book, I had my ideas about Philip, the character played by Leslie Howard. After all, he is a rather complex character a shy, reserved boy, with an adventurous and daring side. Unfortunately, the script makes a complete wimp out of Philip and Leslie Howard certainly did not help with his very passive interpretation. Perhaps my total lack of appreciation for Howard contributed to the general feeling of disappointment about the movie. As mentioned by other reviewers, the movie comes alive only because of Bette Davis. She plays perfectly Mildred, the truly despicable maid. A cold, unfeeling, selfish, ignorant creature, so stupid to destroy the only man who loves her and herself along the way. Mildred is one of the most senselessly self-destructive characters ever. From the moment she enters the movie the audience  and Philip  are aware of what sort of creature she is. Her attitude is rude, she is vulgar and dismissive. It is almost impossible to understand what pushes Philip to pursue her, considering how she thrashes him. Also, given the cold approach of Howard, it is almost impossible to believe his character is so madly in love with her. The total lack of chemistry between Howard and Davis ruins the movie. Some of their scenes are cringe-inducing and involuntarily comic. The worst one involves Philip inviting one of his classmates to spend an evening with Mildred and him, and acting like a voyeur to their shameless flirting behavior. It is just impossible to watch without wondering what sort of man would stand that sort of humiliation. On a side note, it is interesting to note that Davis did not look particularly good at the beginning of the movie, with her classic 30's make-up (pencil thin, wide apart eyebrows which did nothing to make her bulging eyes look less protruding). However, her look improves during her descent to hell. Her hair is cut into a platinum bob; the smudged, smoky make-up around her eyes makes her face strangely modern; her whole features becomes less doll-like stylized. As I watched the DVD, I almost fell asleep towards the end, wondering how Scarlett O'Hara ever managed to be so passionately in love with Ashley, played by the very same Howard. . My apologies to Howard's fans, but I totally lack any appreciation for his skills. Bravo to Davis, as usual, but even she is not enough to make this movie a classic.

    Leslie Howard is only remembered today for marrying Scarlett in Gone With The Wind. Considering Howard would die in 1943 at age 50, that is not a surprise. He died as a casualty of the war. When you look at the work of his career, the legacy he left behind is impressive. He starred in 34 films, produced & directed several films and even found time to do some soundtracks to a couple of films, and wrote some films too. A busy 50 years. Here he is the main man with a problem that he had on Gone With The Wind too. He is in love with a waitress (Bette Davis) who does not love him. She runs off twice having a child with one of them, but when she comes back he welcomes her despite her indiscretions. Meanwhile, he gets attention from at least another beautiful woman but chooses to keep the living together relationship with the woman who spurned him. At one point in this film he utters to her, "I know that you will never love me," which is not unlike a line he makes to Scarlett 5 years later. Howard is excellent here and Davis playing the bad girl is great. She throws what you can only call a "hissy fit" at one point in the movie that is great acting. Even though she is back after 2 lovers, she destroys everything that Howard holds of value. In the long run, this comes back to bite her as she winds up on the streets with him. Based upon W. Somerset Maugham's novel, this film is a solid drama that holds up well considering when the film was made. Frances Dee & Kay Johnson are featured in the cast.

    This film is based on the story by British author, Somerset Maugham. The story begins with a struggling artist, Philip Carey (played wonderfully by the late Leslie Howard). He is advised that he's a mediocre artist. With that, he returns home to London and goes to medical school. There he becomes infatuated and in an unhealthy relationship with Mildred Rogers (played wonderfully by the late great Bette Davis). I'm not going into the controversy of why Bette Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for this performance. I know that she has done brilliantly in other film roles and would be awarded two Oscars in her lifetime. Anyway, the film really concentrates Philip Carey's character who was born with a club foot which makes him walk funny. His handicap is barely noticeable to the audience but the character feels it so self-consciously. His relationship with Mildred's character is complicated. The film is not about bondage at all which was not even discussed in that time. In fact, the film is about unrequited love, obsession, infatuation, and unhealthy relationships. It's still relevant to today's world.

    Such a disappointment after many readings of the W. Somerset Maugham's novel. The charm of the book's is main character, Philip, his struggles with poverty, a lonely childhood, fascination with Mildred, and other issues that are resolved beautifully by the author are totally missing from this movie. The movie begins with Philip as a full grown man. What motives are there for the viewer to understand his behavior? Nothing. The low-life played by Betty Davis is a huge turn-off. Gack! Who but a masochist could be attracted to her? The Sally of the movie is nothing like the Sally of the book. The books development of Philip and Sally's relationship has no development that is tender or shows Sally's character as in the book. Philip's internal dialog in the book as he ponders not living with Sally, is barely given account. So much of the book is missing this movie is a skeletal parody at best.
