  Spending the summer in a holiday camp with her family, Frances "Baby" Houseman falls in love with the camp's dance instructor Johnny Castle.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In 1963, Frances "Baby" Houseman, a sweet daddy's girl, goes with her family to a resort in upstate New York's Catskill Mountains. Baby has grown up in privileged surroundings and all expect her to go on to college, join the Peace Corps and save the world before marrying a doctor, just like her father. Unexpectedly, Baby becomes infatuated with the camp's dance instructor, Johnny Castle, a man whose background is vastly different from her own. Baby lies to her father to get money to pay for an illegal abortion for Johnny's dance partner. She then fills in as Johnny's dance partner and it is as he is teaching her the dance routine that they fall in love. It all comes apart when Johnny's friend falls seriously ill after her abortion and Baby gets her father, who saves the girl's life. He then learns what Baby has been up to, who with and worse - that he funded the illegal abortion. He bans his daughter from any further association with "those people". In the first deliberately willful ...

    To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, "Dirty Dancing" plays like the third opus of an unofficial "Summer 62-63" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon. The first two films were "American Graffiti" and "Animal House", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. "Animal House" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And "Dirty Dancing" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three. But is that a criticism? In fact, "Dirty Dancing" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of "9&frac12; Weeks". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal "I've Had the Time of My Life" finale, these considerations hardly matter. Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how "Dirty Dancing" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point. For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, &agrave; la "West Side Story". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of "Dirty Dancing" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't "Grease", or "Saturday Night Fever" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual? Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, "I've had the time of life" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression "guilty pleasure" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see "Dirty Dancing". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters. And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.

    The beauty of this movie can not be described in words no matter how long a paragraph it is, so I will just say this" -pure -moving -beautiful love story -genuine -flawless acting if you haven't seen this movie... your life is incomplete.. and you may think I'm exaggerating but when you watch it you will agree. what shocks me most is that this was independently made but it has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen, and highly doubt that an industry involved movie could have produced. it really is one of the most touching films I have ever seen as a film major, and I have seen many spanning over the decades of cinema. They don't call this a classic without reason.. watch it and it will become apparent to you in seconds.

    This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis "Baby" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love. Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film. If you don't enjoy it, you're dead inside.

    I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole. Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like "Lolita" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a "masterpiece".

    27-Year Old Jennifer Grey the daughter of Joel Grey, plays Francis "Baby" Houseman about to go into the Peace Corps. Along with her parents and sister, they head to the Caskills resort as this will change her life forever. There she gets involved with the activities and going on there. And handsome streetwise instructor Johnny Castle, played to brilliance by the late Patrick Swayze. After the regular dancer Penny, played by Cynthia Rhodes goes down with an unexpectant pregnancy. Without dance experience herself, Baby volunteers to replace Penny. As she also pays for Penny to have an abortion by asking her father money but without going into details. Because her father trusts her and she is a daddy's girl! Johnny and Baby fight but then a friendship than romance begins to blossom. Between the two but they will have to keep that a secret as well. After Penny has the abortion and the father, played by the late great, Jerry Orbach can't trust Baby and orders her not to see Johnny who he blames for the abortion, and his friends ever again. But it is standing up regardless of the consequences as Johnny really is sees in Baby as despite being streetwise, he felt bullied upon. As he sees Baby is not afraid to do that. Great dancing and at times, the script can be a bit corny. But the acting helps out a lot. As with two leads that are both dancers and actors really help out! Chemistry between Swayze and Grey is awesome!

    The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of m&eacute;salliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart. "Dirty Dancing" delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history. Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although "Ghost" probably would give it some competition), "Dirty Dancing" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.

    It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqu&eacute; than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages. The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like "Did people really dance like that?" and "Could I learn how?" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of "boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance. As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other. I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think. Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, clich&eacute; classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.

    I grew up in the late 90's but I grew up watching Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey on "Dirty Dancing". Partick and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and you could tell they were more than just being Baby and Johnny, they were being themselves. From "Love Man" to "Cry To Me" to "The Time of My Life", you see how Baby and Johnny's relationship develops from just dance partners to lovers. Baby matures beautifully and blooms into a confident young woman while Johnny learns that someone actually cares for him and that their are good people in the world. Both Sawyze and Grey dance with great passion in the finale dance, which will leave you in a lovely mood. Rest in peace Patrick. You are greatly and forever missed.

    I must say I didn't watch Dirty Dancing until a few years ago. Everyone always raved on about it, but for some reason I just never watched it. When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times! I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together. I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie! I instantly went out and bought the soundtrack and had it on repeat in my car for about 2 years. Loved it! 10/10

    "No one puts Baby in a corner" is the tell all line in the classic coming to age movie Dirty Dancing. Now in a special 25 year blue ray release. Skinny Cow Ice cream held a celebration for fans or new fans to delve to an age of innocents in the summer of 1963, before JFK was shot, before the cynicism that has permeated our world. In this tale, Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes on holiday with her family to the conclave of a resort. She is set to tackle the world and make her mark. In the mean time she falls for her dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) as she works with him to master her mambo steps. In the end you leave yearning for a much simpler time and that one period that the world was filled with possibility.

It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film. If you don't enjoy it, you're dead inside.

    I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole. Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like "Lolita" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a "masterpiece".

Because her father trusts her and she is a daddy's girl! Johnny and Baby fight but then a friendship than romance begins to blossom. Between the two but they will have to keep that a secret as well. After Penny has the abortion and the father, played by the late great, Jerry Orbach can't trust Baby and orders her not to see Johnny who he blames for the abortion, and his friends ever again.

    The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of m&eacute;salliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart. "Dirty Dancing" delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history. Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although "Ghost" probably would give it some competition), "Dirty Dancing" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.

    It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqu&eacute; than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages. The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like "Did people really dance like that?" and "Could I learn how?" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of "boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance. As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other. I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think. Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, clich&eacute; classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.

    I grew up in the late 90's but I grew up watching Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey on "Dirty Dancing". Partick and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and you could tell they were more than just being Baby and Johnny, they were being themselves. From "Love Man" to "Cry To Me" to "The Time of My Life", you see how Baby and Johnny's relationship develops from just dance partners to lovers. Baby matures beautifully and blooms into a confident young woman while Johnny learns that someone actually cares for him and that their are good people in the world. Both Sawyze and Grey dance with great passion in the finale dance, which will leave you in a lovely mood. Rest in peace Patrick. You are greatly and forever missed.

    I must say I didn't watch Dirty Dancing until a few years ago. Everyone always raved on about it, but for some reason I just never watched it. When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times! I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together. I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie! I instantly went out and bought the soundtrack and had it on repeat in my car for about 2 years. Loved it! 10/10

    "No one puts Baby in a corner" is the tell all line in the classic coming to age movie Dirty Dancing. Now in a special 25 year blue ray release. Skinny Cow Ice cream held a celebration for fans or new fans to delve to an age of innocents in the summer of 1963, before JFK was shot, before the cynicism that has permeated our world. In this tale, Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes on holiday with her family to the conclave of a resort. She is set to tackle the world and make her mark. In the mean time she falls for her dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) as she works with him to master her mambo steps. In the end you leave yearning for a much simpler time and that one period that the world was filled with possibility.

    To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, "Dirty Dancing" plays like the third opus of an unofficial "Summer 62-63" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon. The first two films were "American Graffiti" and "Animal House", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. "Animal House" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And "Dirty Dancing" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three. But is that a criticism? In fact, "Dirty Dancing" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of "9&frac12; Weeks". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal "I've Had the Time of My Life" finale, these considerations hardly matter. Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how "Dirty Dancing" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point. For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, &agrave; la "West Side Story". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of "Dirty Dancing" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't "Grease", or "Saturday Night Fever" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual? Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, "I've had the time of life" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression "guilty pleasure" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see "Dirty Dancing". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters. And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.

    The beauty of this movie can not be described in words no matter how long a paragraph it is, so I will just say this" -pure -moving -beautiful love story -genuine -flawless acting if you haven't seen this movie... your life is incomplete.. and you may think I'm exaggerating but when you watch it you will agree. what shocks me most is that this was independently made but it has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen, and highly doubt that an industry involved movie could have produced. it really is one of the most touching films I have ever seen as a film major, and I have seen many spanning over the decades of cinema. They don't call this a classic without reason.. watch it and it will become apparent to you in seconds.

    This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis "Baby" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love. Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film. If you don't enjoy it, you're dead inside.

When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times! I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together. I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie! I instantly went out and bought the soundtrack and had it on repeat in my car for about 2 years. Loved it! 10/10

    "No one puts Baby in a corner" is the tell all line in the classic coming to age movie Dirty Dancing. Now in a special 25 year blue ray release. Skinny Cow Ice cream held a celebration for fans or new fans to delve to an age of innocents in the summer of 1963, before JFK was shot, before the cynicism that has permeated our world. In this tale, Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes on holiday with her family to the conclave of a resort. She is set to tackle the world and make her mark. In the mean time she falls for her dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) as she works with him to master her mambo steps. In the end you leave yearning for a much simpler time and that one period that the world was filled with possibility.

    To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, "Dirty Dancing" plays like the third opus of an unofficial "Summer 62-63" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon. The first two films were "American Graffiti" and "Animal House", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. "Animal House" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And "Dirty Dancing" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three. But is that a criticism? In fact, "Dirty Dancing" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of "9&frac12; Weeks". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal "I've Had the Time of My Life" finale, these considerations hardly matter. Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how "Dirty Dancing" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point. For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, &agrave; la "West Side Story". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of "Dirty Dancing" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't "Grease", or "Saturday Night Fever" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual? Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, "I've had the time of life" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression "guilty pleasure" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see "Dirty Dancing". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters. And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.

They don't call this a classic without reason.. watch it and it will become apparent to you in seconds.

    This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis "Baby" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love. Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film. If you don't enjoy it, you're dead inside.

    I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole. Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like "Lolita" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a "masterpiece".

    27-Year Old Jennifer Grey the daughter of Joel Grey, plays Francis "Baby" Houseman about to go into the Peace Corps. Along with her parents and sister, they head to the Caskills resort as this will change her life forever. There she gets involved with the activities and going on there. And handsome streetwise instructor Johnny Castle, played to brilliance by the late Patrick Swayze. After the regular dancer Penny, played by Cynthia Rhodes goes down with an unexpectant pregnancy. Without dance experience herself, Baby volunteers to replace Penny. As she also pays for Penny to have an abortion by asking her father money but without going into details. Because her father trusts her and she is a daddy's girl! Johnny and Baby fight but then a friendship than romance begins to blossom. Between the two but they will have to keep that a secret as well. After Penny has the abortion and the father, played by the late great, Jerry Orbach can't trust Baby and orders her not to see Johnny who he blames for the abortion, and his friends ever again. But it is standing up regardless of the consequences as Johnny really is sees in Baby as despite being streetwise, he felt bullied upon. As he sees Baby is not afraid to do that. Great dancing and at times, the script can be a bit corny. But the acting helps out a lot. As with two leads that are both dancers and actors really help out! Chemistry between Swayze and Grey is awesome!

    The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of m&eacute;salliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart. "Dirty Dancing" delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history. Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although "Ghost" probably would give it some competition), "Dirty Dancing" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.

    It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqu&eacute; than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages. The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like "Did people really dance like that?" and "Could I learn how?" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of "boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance. As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other. I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think. Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, clich&eacute; classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.

    I grew up in the late 90's but I grew up watching Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey on "Dirty Dancing". Partick and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and you could tell they were more than just being Baby and Johnny, they were being themselves. From "Love Man" to "Cry To Me" to "The Time of My Life", you see how Baby and Johnny's relationship develops from just dance partners to lovers. Baby matures beautifully and blooms into a confident young woman while Johnny learns that someone actually cares for him and that their are good people in the world. Both Sawyze and Grey dance with great passion in the finale dance, which will leave you in a lovely mood. Rest in peace Patrick. You are greatly and forever missed.

    I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole. Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like "Lolita" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a "masterpiece".

Because her father trusts her and she is a daddy's girl! Johnny and Baby fight but then a friendship than romance begins to blossom. Between the two but they will have to keep that a secret as well. After Penny has the abortion and the father, played by the late great, Jerry Orbach can't trust Baby and orders her not to see Johnny who he blames for the abortion, and his friends ever again.

    The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of m&eacute;salliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart. "Dirty Dancing" delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history. Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although "Ghost" probably would give it some competition), "Dirty Dancing" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.

    It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqu&eacute; than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages. The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like "Did people really dance like that?" and "Could I learn how?" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of "boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance. As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other. I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think. Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, clich&eacute; classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.

    I grew up in the late 90's but I grew up watching Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey on "Dirty Dancing". Partick and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and you could tell they were more than just being Baby and Johnny, they were being themselves. From "Love Man" to "Cry To Me" to "The Time of My Life", you see how Baby and Johnny's relationship develops from just dance partners to lovers. Baby matures beautifully and blooms into a confident young woman while Johnny learns that someone actually cares for him and that their are good people in the world. Both Sawyze and Grey dance with great passion in the finale dance, which will leave you in a lovely mood. Rest in peace Patrick. You are greatly and forever missed.

    I must say I didn't watch Dirty Dancing until a few years ago. Everyone always raved on about it, but for some reason I just never watched it. When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times! I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together. I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie! I instantly went out and bought the soundtrack and had it on repeat in my car for about 2 years. Loved it! 10/10

    "No one puts Baby in a corner" is the tell all line in the classic coming to age movie Dirty Dancing. Now in a special 25 year blue ray release. Skinny Cow Ice cream held a celebration for fans or new fans to delve to an age of innocents in the summer of 1963, before JFK was shot, before the cynicism that has permeated our world. In this tale, Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes on holiday with her family to the conclave of a resort. She is set to tackle the world and make her mark. In the mean time she falls for her dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) as she works with him to master her mambo steps. In the end you leave yearning for a much simpler time and that one period that the world was filled with possibility.

    To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, "Dirty Dancing" plays like the third opus of an unofficial "Summer 62-63" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon. The first two films were "American Graffiti" and "Animal House", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. "Animal House" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And "Dirty Dancing" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three. But is that a criticism? In fact, "Dirty Dancing" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of "9&frac12; Weeks". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal "I've Had the Time of My Life" finale, these considerations hardly matter. Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how "Dirty Dancing" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point. For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, &agrave; la "West Side Story". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of "Dirty Dancing" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't "Grease", or "Saturday Night Fever" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual? Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, "I've had the time of life" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression "guilty pleasure" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see "Dirty Dancing". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters. And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.

    The beauty of this movie can not be described in words no matter how long a paragraph it is, so I will just say this" -pure -moving -beautiful love story -genuine -flawless acting if you haven't seen this movie... your life is incomplete.. and you may think I'm exaggerating but when you watch it you will agree. what shocks me most is that this was independently made but it has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen, and highly doubt that an industry involved movie could have produced. it really is one of the most touching films I have ever seen as a film major, and I have seen many spanning over the decades of cinema. They don't call this a classic without reason.. watch it and it will become apparent to you in seconds.

    This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis "Baby" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love. Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film. If you don't enjoy it, you're dead inside.

    "No one puts Baby in a corner" is the tell all line in the classic coming to age movie Dirty Dancing. Now in a special 25 year blue ray release. Skinny Cow Ice cream held a celebration for fans or new fans to delve to an age of innocents in the summer of 1963, before JFK was shot, before the cynicism that has permeated our world. In this tale, Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes on holiday with her family to the conclave of a resort. She is set to tackle the world and make her mark. In the mean time she falls for her dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) as she works with him to master her mambo steps. In the end you leave yearning for a much simpler time and that one period that the world was filled with possibility.

    To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, "Dirty Dancing" plays like the third opus of an unofficial "Summer 62-63" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon. The first two films were "American Graffiti" and "Animal House", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. "Animal House" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And "Dirty Dancing" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three. But is that a criticism? In fact, "Dirty Dancing" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of "9&frac12; Weeks". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal "I've Had the Time of My Life" finale, these considerations hardly matter. Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how "Dirty Dancing" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point. For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, &agrave; la "West Side Story". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of "Dirty Dancing" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't "Grease", or "Saturday Night Fever" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual? Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, "I've had the time of life" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression "guilty pleasure" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see "Dirty Dancing". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters. And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.

    The beauty of this movie can not be described in words no matter how long a paragraph it is, so I will just say this" -pure -moving -beautiful love story -genuine -flawless acting if you haven't seen this movie... your life is incomplete.. and you may think I'm exaggerating but when you watch it you will agree. what shocks me most is that this was independently made but it has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen, and highly doubt that an industry involved movie could have produced. it really is one of the most touching films I have ever seen as a film major, and I have seen many spanning over the decades of cinema. They don't call this a classic without reason.. watch it and it will become apparent to you in seconds.

    This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis "Baby" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love. Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film. If you don't enjoy it, you're dead inside.

    I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole. Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like "Lolita" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a "masterpiece".

    27-Year Old Jennifer Grey the daughter of Joel Grey, plays Francis "Baby" Houseman about to go into the Peace Corps. Along with her parents and sister, they head to the Caskills resort as this will change her life forever. There she gets involved with the activities and going on there. And handsome streetwise instructor Johnny Castle, played to brilliance by the late Patrick Swayze. After the regular dancer Penny, played by Cynthia Rhodes goes down with an unexpectant pregnancy. Without dance experience herself, Baby volunteers to replace Penny. As she also pays for Penny to have an abortion by asking her father money but without going into details. Because her father trusts her and she is a daddy's girl! Johnny and Baby fight but then a friendship than romance begins to blossom. Between the two but they will have to keep that a secret as well. After Penny has the abortion and the father, played by the late great, Jerry Orbach can't trust Baby and orders her not to see Johnny who he blames for the abortion, and his friends ever again. But it is standing up regardless of the consequences as Johnny really is sees in Baby as despite being streetwise, he felt bullied upon. As he sees Baby is not afraid to do that. Great dancing and at times, the script can be a bit corny. But the acting helps out a lot. As with two leads that are both dancers and actors really help out! Chemistry between Swayze and Grey is awesome!

    The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of m&eacute;salliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart. "Dirty Dancing" delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history. Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although "Ghost" probably would give it some competition), "Dirty Dancing" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.

    It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqu&eacute; than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages. The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like "Did people really dance like that?" and "Could I learn how?" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of "boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance. As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other. I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think. Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, clich&eacute; classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.

    I grew up in the late 90's but I grew up watching Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey on "Dirty Dancing". Partick and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and you could tell they were more than just being Baby and Johnny, they were being themselves. From "Love Man" to "Cry To Me" to "The Time of My Life", you see how Baby and Johnny's relationship develops from just dance partners to lovers. Baby matures beautifully and blooms into a confident young woman while Johnny learns that someone actually cares for him and that their are good people in the world. Both Sawyze and Grey dance with great passion in the finale dance, which will leave you in a lovely mood. Rest in peace Patrick. You are greatly and forever missed.

    I must say I didn't watch Dirty Dancing until a few years ago. Everyone always raved on about it, but for some reason I just never watched it. When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times! I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together. I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie! I instantly went out and bought the soundtrack and had it on repeat in my car for about 2 years. Loved it! 10/10

Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like "Lolita" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a "masterpiece".

    The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of m&eacute;salliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart. "Dirty Dancing" delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history. Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although "Ghost" probably would give it some competition), "Dirty Dancing" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.

    It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqu&eacute; than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages. The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like "Did people really dance like that?" and "Could I learn how?" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of "boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance. As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other. I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think. Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, clich&eacute; classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.

    I grew up in the late 90's but I grew up watching Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey on "Dirty Dancing". Partick and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and you could tell they were more than just being Baby and Johnny, they were being themselves. From "Love Man" to "Cry To Me" to "The Time of My Life", you see how Baby and Johnny's relationship develops from just dance partners to lovers. Baby matures beautifully and blooms into a confident young woman while Johnny learns that someone actually cares for him and that their are good people in the world. Both Sawyze and Grey dance with great passion in the finale dance, which will leave you in a lovely mood. Rest in peace Patrick. You are greatly and forever missed.

    I must say I didn't watch Dirty Dancing until a few years ago. Everyone always raved on about it, but for some reason I just never watched it. When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times! I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together. I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie! I instantly went out and bought the soundtrack and had it on repeat in my car for about 2 years. Loved it! 10/10

    "No one puts Baby in a corner" is the tell all line in the classic coming to age movie Dirty Dancing. Now in a special 25 year blue ray release. Skinny Cow Ice cream held a celebration for fans or new fans to delve to an age of innocents in the summer of 1963, before JFK was shot, before the cynicism that has permeated our world. In this tale, Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) goes on holiday with her family to the conclave of a resort. She is set to tackle the world and make her mark. In the mean time she falls for her dance instructor Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) as she works with him to master her mambo steps. In the end you leave yearning for a much simpler time and that one period that the world was filled with possibility.

    To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, "Dirty Dancing" plays like the third opus of an unofficial "Summer 62-63" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon. The first two films were "American Graffiti" and "Animal House", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. "Animal House" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And "Dirty Dancing" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three. But is that a criticism? In fact, "Dirty Dancing" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of "9&frac12; Weeks". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal "I've Had the Time of My Life" finale, these considerations hardly matter. Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how "Dirty Dancing" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point. For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, &agrave; la "West Side Story". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of "Dirty Dancing" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't "Grease", or "Saturday Night Fever" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual? Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, "I've had the time of life" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression "guilty pleasure" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see "Dirty Dancing". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters. And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.

    The beauty of this movie can not be described in words no matter how long a paragraph it is, so I will just say this" -pure -moving -beautiful love story -genuine -flawless acting if you haven't seen this movie... your life is incomplete.. and you may think I'm exaggerating but when you watch it you will agree. what shocks me most is that this was independently made but it has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen, and highly doubt that an industry involved movie could have produced. it really is one of the most touching films I have ever seen as a film major, and I have seen many spanning over the decades of cinema. They don't call this a classic without reason.. watch it and it will become apparent to you in seconds.

    This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis "Baby" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love. Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film. If you don't enjoy it, you're dead inside.

    I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole. Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers?

    Not flawless, but when judged in the light of what is done today, "Dirty Dancing" is a definite classic ...

    To some extents, and regarding its respectable classic status, "Dirty Dancing" plays like the third opus of an unofficial "Summer 62-63" trilogy, a trilogy rhyming with eulogy to the magical American parenthesis preceding a tumultuous decade that started with Kennedy's assassination, followed by the Vietnam War, the flower power and concluding with the disillusioning departure of Richard Nixon. The first two films were "American Graffiti" and "Animal House", and it's interesting how each one embraced the feel of its time. George Lucas' sleeper hit was a nostalgic ode to the 60's and its two youth-defining elements: rock'n'roll and cars. "Animal House" was zany and anarchic, fitting the rebellious spirit from which 70's artists fueled their inspiration. And "Dirty Dancing" (two-word titled too) tries to reconcile between both approaches through an improbable love story between a timid teenager with a bourgeois background and a free- spirited punk who works in the same summer resort she spends her vacation with her rich family. The guy is an expert dancer, especially dances that consists on explicitly erotic moves but no matter how 'dirty' they feel, the film handles its material with less subversion you might expect, ending up being the most (unintentionally?) innocent of the three. But is that a criticism? In fact, "Dirty Dancing" is tailor-made for the 80's and the so-called dirty dancing needed to be sugar-coated for ratings reason, as it didn't try to be a musical version of "9&frac12; Weeks". So logically, such a nostalgic immersion into a two-decade old era at a time where high-budgeted action-driven blockbusters were the norm could only increase the chances to catch the viewers' eyes (and ears). And for all the pretension it ever had, the film's magic worked, since it ended up being one of the highest-grossing of the year, much more, it reached an iconic status forever immortalized by the timid Frances 'Baby' Levy finally jumping in Johnny Castle's arms. She's your typical not-so ugly duckling, he's the perfect mix of James Dean and John Travolta and it's the typical underdog / impossible romance / coming- to-age story, but when enjoying the immortal "I've Had the Time of My Life" finale, these considerations hardly matter. Still, I'm not denying there's no room for criticism: reading Roger Ebert's analysis, there's not one statement that doesn't ring true, and it's quite a delight to read how "Dirty Dancing" inspired a sort of delightfully sarcastic anger toward an overly formulaic plot. Do I need to list these overused devices? Yes, we know, the shy little girl will grow up and become a great dancer. We know that her father won't approve the romance. We know that some unfortunate misunderstanding will make him believe that Johnny is a bad guy, even if one bit of explanation would have cleared everything. And we know that they will finally dance together, the signal induced by the famous, or infamous line "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", uttered by Patrick Swayze, who by the way, hated that line. Indeed, some pieces of dialog were lacking and some others were too many. But no matter how irritating or predictable every single plot line was, in the context of the film, it didn't betray lousiness in the script but more of a naive straightforward way to get to its point. For instance, having struggled to learn the basic steps of rock and salsa before giving up, I couldn't believe Baby would learn that fast. But I assumed that the purpose of the dirty dancing is to let yourself (as a girl) be guided by your partner's luscious moves and maybe she just 'had it' inside her and had to have that little catalysis from falling in love with her partner. Sure the dirty dancers are obviously professionals, and the racial diversity in the dancing hall is not the most realistic touch of the film. Sure, the whole 'abortion' misunderstanding needed a more serious focus, that and the fact that Baby came from a Jewish background to insist on the family pressure element, &agrave; la "West Side Story". Sure, the dances were not quite exactly dirty (Ebert admitted himself he was misled) but I guess it referred less to the moves than their earlier perceptions from Levy's perspective. But can we blame the film for having a good and catchy title? I guess it handled with confidence a basic material, the flaws are those of average movies, but for some exceptional reasons, they didn't ruin the enjoyment of "Dirty Dancing" because the focus was on the two lead performances, which were good. The role of Johnny was perfect for Patrick Swayze, and Jennifer Grey is absolutely convincing and endearing as the indeed baby-faced Baby. Sometimes, that's all you need to make a good film if it has enough confidence and sincerity about its material. Sure, this isn't "Grease", or "Saturday Night Fever" but the chemistry works between Grey and Swayze, and we like them. Why being so intellectual? Paraphrasing the Oscar-winning song, "I've had the time of life" to watch movies and if I didn't see the ending coming, I wouldn't call myself a movie lover. But I guess that's what the expression "guilty pleasure" was made for. But I respect the achievement of a film that stood the test of time and became such a phenomenon, still considered one of the defining films of the 80's. I also respect it because it's the film that made Patrick Swayze a movie star. And it also gave a one-hit success for Jennifer Grey, the actress who infamously made that rhino-plastic surgery to sink irremediably in anonymity, while it's precisely her 'girl next door' features that touched the public's heart when they came to see "Dirty Dancing". Sometimes, an actor should learn lessons from his own characters. And if only for having inspired one of Rogert Ebert's most irresistible reviews, I'm glad the film was done.

    The beauty of this movie can not be described in words no matter how long a paragraph it is, so I will just say this" -pure -moving -beautiful love story -genuine -flawless acting if you haven't seen this movie... your life is incomplete.. and you may think I'm exaggerating but when you watch it you will agree. what shocks me most is that this was independently made but it has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen, and highly doubt that an industry involved movie could have produced. it really is one of the most touching films I have ever seen as a film major, and I have seen many spanning over the decades of cinema. They don't call this a classic without reason.. watch it and it will become apparent to you in seconds.

    This is the film that catapulted Patrick Swayze to be an international super-star and household name, and rightly so. He was awesome as Johnny Castle, dance teacher and entertainer in an American Holiday camp frequented by a doctor and his family; wife and two girls. One of the girls, Francis "Baby" Houseman, gets caught up with some of the entertainers at the camp and ends up learning to dance at the hands of Swayze. Of course he becomes her first love. Many of the scenes in the film are so iconic now, as is the music. The film produced two great soundtrack albums, and has been greatly imitated. Baby Houseman, played by Jennifer Grey, found it hard to learn the dance moves, to comic effect. The film is laugh out loud in places by mainly gentle humour, heart, warmth and is about love, loyalty and friendship and with comment on society's differences in class and how you can't judge books by their cover. It's a lovely film, but despite the wonderful dance scenes and great performances by Swayze, Grey and Cynthia Rhodes - a fantastic dancer - but there is also some rather cheesy acting and it's not a perfect film, and hasn't aged that well (also considering that it's set in the early 60s) from the 80s. Despite the flaws, it's a fantastic, entertaining and uplifting film. If you don't enjoy it, you're dead inside.

    I saw this movie for the first time when I was still a pre-teen, because one of the girls I knew from school (an older teenager) was obsessed with it. I didn't get it back then. I saw this movie again in my late teens, and didn't get it then, either. Watched it again the other day, and I STILL don't get it! I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's unremarkable, boring, predictable, monotonous, and thoroughly mediocre. As if that wasn't enough, it also manages to be offensive to boot. The plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring; the dialogue - horrendous. There was ZERO chemistry between the lead actors. In fact, it was quite apparent that they can't stand each other. Speaking of characters, - they were all HIGHLY unlikeable. Johnny = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional a***hole. Baby = obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, one-dimensional slag. And it's actually quite disgusting that Patrick Swayze, who seems to be in his mid-30s, is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior. Granted, she was a slapper, but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers? Don't get me wrong, I did like "Lolita" (where the same was happening, but it's expected, and actually quite tastefully done), but this... was just creepy and disturbing. It's just my opinion, but I think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a "masterpiece".

    27-Year Old Jennifer Grey the daughter of Joel Grey, plays Francis "Baby" Houseman about to go into the Peace Corps. Along with her parents and sister, they head to the Caskills resort as this will change her life forever. There she gets involved with the activities and going on there. And handsome streetwise instructor Johnny Castle, played to brilliance by the late Patrick Swayze. After the regular dancer Penny, played by Cynthia Rhodes goes down with an unexpectant pregnancy. Without dance experience herself, Baby volunteers to replace Penny. As she also pays for Penny to have an abortion by asking her father money but without going into details. Because her father trusts her and she is a daddy's girl! Johnny and Baby fight but then a friendship than romance begins to blossom. Between the two but they will have to keep that a secret as well. After Penny has the abortion and the father, played by the late great, Jerry Orbach can't trust Baby and orders her not to see Johnny who he blames for the abortion, and his friends ever again. But it is standing up regardless of the consequences as Johnny really is sees in Baby as despite being streetwise, he felt bullied upon. As he sees Baby is not afraid to do that. Great dancing and at times, the script can be a bit corny. But the acting helps out a lot. As with two leads that are both dancers and actors really help out! Chemistry between Swayze and Grey is awesome!

    The ultimate dance flick is still a timeless gem from the 1980s. It may lack polish or even sensibility, but the charm is unrelenting. Fronted by the heavenly pairing of Jennifer Grey as the timid town girl Frances 'Baby' Houseman with a need to exhale and the unforgettable Patrick Swayze as booty shaking dance instructor Johnny Castle. Sets in 1953, it centres around a simple case of m&eacute;salliance, when up-town teenager on holiday in Catskills resort falls for the crass, but empathic dancer. Aptly named Baby she is the apple of her father's eye, perfect and untainted. But growing up brings about urges and changes - idyllic family relationships are bound to either adapt or fall apart. "Dirty Dancing" delivers a deeply felt promise of naive youthful romance with unbelievable chemistry between the two main protagonists. The story may be simple (albeit brings in a pretty touchy issue of abortion), but filled with magic which inexplicably refuses to die away with age or repeated watching. Even now, as an adult I seem still somewhat embarrassingly enticed by the simplistic allure, albeit notice the inherent flaws, stereotypical characters or shortcomings of the entire story. What is probably still the most successful in this movie is its terrific score with what could possibly be the best pop musical score in movie history. Probably the highlight of Patrick Swayze's career (although "Ghost" probably would give it some competition), "Dirty Dancing" turned out to be just 15 minutes of fame for Jennifer Grey, who self-mutilated her career by plastic surgery, which dispossessed her of a peculiarly enticing Roman nose, replacing it with something more generic and changing her beyond recognition.

    It could be the summer atmosphere, or the time frame of simpler days, or maybe it's the forbidden love between the ultimate bad boy and daddy's little girl, and the music that perfectly sets the mood for each scene; but what I think what makes the movie, Dirty Dancing, so intriguing is simply the dancing itself. We've all seen those movies where we leave the theater thinking we can sing any song, or move to any beat that comes our way, and this is one of those movies. The dancing is different from any other movie, because although it takes place in the sixties, the dancing is so much more risqu&eacute; than anything movie watchers were accustomed to seeing at that point in time. While using older songs combined with young, sensual dancing the movie is able to reach out to an audience with a variety of ages. The movie introduces its unique dancing early on, automatically intriguing the viewers to question things like "Did people really dance like that?" and "Could I learn how?" The movie is able to reach out to these common people by having the main character, Baby Houseman, witness the dancing for the very first time and shows her utter shock, but also her desire to know more. As the plot continues and the characters become more developed the dancing becomes not only a sight to see, but also it leaves a window for inferences to be made. As Baby is trained to dance by bad-boy Johnny the viewers begin to wonder if their sensual dancing will ever lead to something more? This movie is able to take the typical idea of "boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love" and completely make it new, unique, and fascinating all through the use of dance. As Baby and Johnny get to know each other better throughout their training process, the movement of their dancing goes from simply following the motions, and transitions to actually feeling the music and even expressing their inner feelings for one another. As their love affair grows so does the viewers love and desire to see more and more dancing. The movie does a great job creating the idea that the characters are their truest selves in dancing scenes more than any other. I think so many people enjoy the movie because it doesn't just tell a love story, but shows one. It is able to show a love story not by the characters words but by their choreography. Before Baby or Johnny even declares their feelings for one another it is seen in the way their dancing morphs over time, from impersonal to all consuming. To the characters in the movie, their raunchy dancing is a way to rebel against the expectations of the generations above them, and through this the movie gives the audience a sense of defiance and the idea that they should be proud to do what they love, no matter what society may think. Over all it is so difficult to pin-point what makes Dirty Dancing the wonderful, clich&eacute; classic that it is, but the dancing aspect I feel is what ties the intriguing plot, the charismatic characters, the music, and the beautiful setting all together to create something more than a romantic drama. Dirty Dancing is one of those movies I could watch time after time and only grow more in love with it. It has the perfect amount of drama, romance, conflict, and cheesy monologues to satisfy all my desires when watching a movie. Because of this movie the song Time of My Life will always strike a chord in my heart and dancing will never be quite as great unless it's Dirty Dancing.

    I grew up in the late 90's but I grew up watching Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey on "Dirty Dancing". Partick and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and you could tell they were more than just being Baby and Johnny, they were being themselves. From "Love Man" to "Cry To Me" to "The Time of My Life", you see how Baby and Johnny's relationship develops from just dance partners to lovers. Baby matures beautifully and blooms into a confident young woman while Johnny learns that someone actually cares for him and that their are good people in the world. Both Sawyze and Grey dance with great passion in the finale dance, which will leave you in a lovely mood. Rest in peace Patrick. You are greatly and forever missed.

    I must say I didn't watch Dirty Dancing until a few years ago. Everyone always raved on about it, but for some reason I just never watched it. When I finally did, i couldn't believe I had waited so long, and have since seen it about a dozen times! I had loved Patrick Swayze since I first saw Ghost, so knew he would be fantastic, but I had never seen Jennifer Grey in anything, and I admit when I first saw her I couldn't believe this plain Jane was going to steal Johnny's heart. But as the movie went on she grew on me, and by the end I was imagining the cute little babies they would make together. I read somewhere that the two leads hated each other all the way through filming, but I never would have guessed, their chemistry was great. Good girl falls for bad boy, always a story I can't tear myself away from. And the music, oh the music was what made the movie! I instantly went out and bought the soundtrack and had it on repeat in my car for about 2 years. Loved it! 10/10
