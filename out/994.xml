    To clear up any misconceptions, it's based on the Cherry Mary letter to Kerouac(not Ginsberg) and the Reeves character isn't supposed to be Kerouac, he's supposed to be one of Cassady's old Denver pool hall buddies. If you recall the beginning of the movie, Cassady is writing this story to Kerouac(it's the letter, get it?) why would he be telling Kerouac a story that Kerouac was such a big part of? Plus, Kerouac, though he liked to drink, wasn't like that at all. Although I do believe that Benjamin is based on Ginsberg. Even though the nameless guy from the letter that he represents wasn't Ginsberg, I think Kay took the opportunity of a blank-slate character to make a Ginsberg character(I base this on the attitude of the character, the obvious crush he has on Cassady, and the race car story that Cassady tells him which is a story Cassady told Ginsberg orally in reality that Ginsberg jotted down and that you can find in Cassady's book, The First Third), which is a great idea. Except that Adrian Brody stands firmly as my least favorite Allen Ginsberg portrayal of all time. He did not capture Ginsberg's brand of warmth and sweetness even slightly. The writing cannot be blamed for how annoying Brody played him. See the Ginsberg portrayals in Naked Lunch and I'm Not There for very good Ginsbergs by Michael Zelniker and David Cross. What makes up for Adrian Brody's Ginsberg is Tom Jane's Cassady which is spot on. The way he spoke and moved was perfect. Just short of watching Cassady himself. It was strange to see such good acting and such bad acting right next to each other. Unlike Naked Lunch(Which I think anybody who likes a good movie can easily enjoy) I understand how anyone who doesn't know and like the Beats wouldn't really dig this movie. However it was a lot of fun for me to watch and it will be the next time I watch it too. I don't know if anyone noticed, but in addition to all the lines taken from the letter it's based on, there was lines taken from other stuff Cassady wrote too! Like I said, the race car story he tells Benjamin is a story he told Allen and there is the best line from one of my favorite Cassady/Ginsberg letters: "I see no greatness in myself--I even have no conception of what is greatness. I am a simple-minded, child-like, insipid sort of moronic kind of awkward-feeling adolescent." which is not quoted directly in the movie, as it is in this here review, but it's in there! And I believe the Adventures in Auto Eroticism story is in there too? Probably other stuff I'm forgetting. Anyway, Stephen Kay clearly knows his stuff when it comes to these guys and I don't think the script lacked wit at all, I thought it was natural, especially considering how many of the lines were quotes, I think he mixed them pretty well into his own writing(Although I wouldn't say quite as well a Cronenberg did in Naked Lunch). Also check out Tom Jane in Arrested Development!

    To appreciate this film the viewer needs either to be in a jazzy, rebellious sort of mood, or have some interest in Neal Cassady, an American who figured heavily in the development of the "beat generation" of the 1950s. Set in the 1940s during one notable period of Cassady's life, the film is mostly a character study of Cassady (Thomas Jane), and his relationship with other people in his life, including his friend Harry (Keanu Reeves) and various romantic interests, the central one being Joan (Claire Forlani). But Cassady was a quirky kind of guy, a rebel, a nonconformist, fun loving, with a restless energy, a person constantly on the move, both physically and philosophically. As presented in the film, he is a cross between James Dean and Jim Morrison. Cassady's offbeat personality is mirrored in the film's offbeat style. It's shot partly in color and partly in B&W. Plot structure seems deliberately chaotic, frenetic, loose. Jump cuts can be jarring for viewers expecting a smoothly flowing, linear plot. And the tone alternates between silly and philosophical. Background music is mostly jazz with some blues thrown in. Accordingly, a lot of viewers will find the film's unorthodox style off-putting. But I liked it, for the most part. The plot would have been stronger if it had focused on Cassady's 1950s relationship with other historical figures, like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, instead of his romances with random women. Otherwise, the cinematography, the music, and the performance of Thomas Jane are terrific.

    One of the most surprising things in "The Last Time I Committed Suicide" is the whole part about Neal Cassady's thoughts about living the "ideal" American life (a nuclear family and a house surrounded by a white picket fence). Cassady was one of the major people in the Beat generation, which rejected the "Leave It to Beaver" image of life. If in fact Cassady thought about having this kind of life, then it goes to show his own conflicts, even beyond the main plot in this movie. But I digress. I think that the movie did a good job looking at Neal Cassady (Thomas Jane). He and Jack Kerouac remain two of the most important figures of the 20th century. Also starring Keanu Reeves, Marg Helgenberger and Gretchen Mol...and just take a look at that one scene of her! (you know which one I mean)

    The best thing about this movie is the opening scene, where Neal Cassady is doing more daydreaming and dancing then he is working on his writing. The beginning of the movie screams to Cassady's life, and shows the audience a Marlon Brando type character that had strong ties with folks like, Allen Ginsberg and Jake Kerouac. Cassady, a forgotten literary figure with more passion for creativity then progress in writing, would later become the character to drive the bus in Ken Kesey's, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. It is important to note, that while Cassady had only one decent literary publication, his zealous outlook on life was borrowed by some of the "great literary beat writers" in America. The Actor Keanu Reeves, who I have never been a huge fan of, does an excellent job of shedding light on Cassady's constant dissonance about leaving the life of a beat writer, for the life of a 9-5 working man with a stable house, beautiful wife, and loving family. The movie overall, is about this dissonance, is about the passion that Cassady had for both the creative life and the more stable environment of the family life. Sadly, Cassady was unable to find balance between the two. Do not expect, watching this movie that it will touch your life with a "wow-effect" forever. It is not some type of magical-beat-generation-movie that you can philosophize about for hours, it is just a pretty good movie. What you can keep with you forever, however, is the soundtrack to this movie, The Last Time I Committed Suicide. With scores of music from folks like, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Tyler Bates, Ella Fitzgerald and Charles Mingus, this soundtrack is sure visit any jazz lovers CD player often.

    The most disappointing thing about this movie is that it has no literary value. There is no story to speak of, Neal Cassady's life is pathetically boring, and the dialog is without any wit at all. We follow Neal Cassady -- who is supposed to be 20 but looks 30 -- swap girlfriends and hangs out with some losers, including some totally unrecognizable Beat poets. The actors are doing their best but the script they are grappling with is empty. It's pretty girls and pretty boys, and pretty boring. No wit, and, worst of all, no beat! Neal Cassady : a would-be James Dean without a cause and indeed without a rebellion!

    How can a film with a dream cast that includes Keanu Reeves, Adrien Brody, Marg Helgenberger, Gretchen Mol and Amy Smart go wrong? Try bad script and even worse direction. You might begin to consider suicide yourself about half an hour in. Thomas Jane headlines the cast as Neal Cassady in this headache inducing film biog. He's probably the weakest of the performers involved. But he certainly gets no help from director Stephen Kay who seems more interested in showing off his camera tricks and technique than actually directing actors and making scenes work. When this film isn't painful, its a bore. There is a reason you've never heard of "The Last Time I Committed Suicide". Be grateful and avoid if at all possible.

    The Last Time is a factual look into the life of the Beat Generation's Neal Cassady. It's based upon a letter (the Joan Anderson letter) from Neal Cassady to Jack Kerouac. The scenes are fragmentary, jittery, jazz-punctuated, syncopated, improvised, and skittery; this is the same style in which the Beat writers penned their poems, prose, and personal letters, and it makes the viewer feel as if he/she is reading Beat poetry while watching the film. When the film opens, Cassady is struggling with the aftermath of his girlfriend's attempted suicide. He begins to examine the battle between his own desire to roam free and write, and her desire to live the American dream (marriage, house). Overwhelmed, he plunges headfirst into his own desires... Along the way, Neal realizes that life choices are permanent, for better or for worse. Keanu Reeves appears briefly as Beat writer Jack Kerouac, silky and smooth, who helps Neal smooth out his rough edges. The soundtrack is excellent, and a must have for anyone who likes Jazz. The brilliant, landmark Jazz featured is the soundtrack of the Beats themselves, lively, progressive, explosive, the compositions infinite in possibilities.

    Anyone who has actually read any of the beat narratives, in particular Kerouac and Cassady prose, would agree that the film comes as close to encapsulating the language and overall style onto film as possible. I agree the film does adhere to a certain MTV aesthetic, but whose to say that the aesthetic didn't already exist before it was given that name? One could argue that Neal Cassady himself was one of the more well known ADD characters of late fifties literature, if not all literature, with his penchant for the next free drink of booze, the next broad, jumping from stolen car to stolen car, even ditching his friends (in Mexico in On the Road) if the need arose. While you may have problems with the narrative structure, those of us who are great beat literature enthusiasts recognize that the jump cut style of the narrative already existed and was brought to life in this film in a fantastic manner.

    You know, normally when you have a good script and excellent actors on your project, you can turn out something decent, good or great...even when you, as the director, believe you're talented and think you know what you're doing. But so far as "The Last Time I Committed Suicide" is concerned, Stephen T. Kay flat out ruined this movie, and it is damn near unforgivable. Here we have a screenplay filled with some of the most wonderful dialog you can imagine being delivered by a troupe of wonderful actors. Thomas Jane gives a star making turn as Neal Cassady, and he is backed up with a startlingly naturalistic and cozy turn by Keanu Reeves as his drunk buddy, Harry. But could you enjoy the beautiful rhythm of their work? Noooooooooo. By God, Mr. Kay was going to remind you every step of the way that he is DIRECTING this film and you are going to pay attention to that fact, come hell or high water. I mean, here we have a quiet intense drama about a charismatic man who inspired people like Jack Kerouac and Alan Ginsberg, and the director uses every trick in "The MTV Bible of Pseudo Filmography" to hide that fact and (supposedly) make it palatable for the ADD generation. You got your jump cuts and edits every .9 seconds and odd angles and pretty inserts and on and on and on until I finally wanted to scream at the screen, "Take a F*****G valium!" Drama has to unfold; it cannot be force fed down your gullet because the man making the movie thinks you're too easily distracted to give a damn about the characters. I've only seen one other movie where the director completely destroyed a wonderful script -- "A Chorus of Disapproval" (although if "While You Were Sleeping" had had any other actress in the lead besides Sandra Bullock, it would also fit in this cursed category). So...if you like your drama spit out in food fight fashion, then this is the movie for you. But if you want anything approaching reality, check out something like "La Dolce Vita" by Federico Fellini, who has more style in his right pinkie than in all of Stephen T. Kay's body.

    I am writing this because I am in stark disagreement with a certain editor. This little film shows excellent directing, cinematography and acting. It stands as testimony against, and is infinitely better then, most of the talentless "indie" wastes of time that you'll see in the country's smaller theaters today. Thomas Jane BECOMES a young Neal Cassady, and displays one of the finer performances you'll ever see on film. In fact, the acting is excellent overall (To which the director should be praised). Admittedly, if you are interested in the legend of Neal Cassady this movie is going to be much more interesting to you. Still, even if you are not, it is a fine story of unrequited love, with humor and the spirit of the enjoyment of life. It is a touching period piece, excellently delivered and exceptionally written. The other Cassady-driven movie (unrelated to this cast and crew) - "Heart Beat" (1980) - hits you like a stale yellow lamp on a boring Sunday afternoon by comparison. This film is vivid and beautiful. It is a shame that a film of this caliber is being ignorantly shuffled under the carpet, becoming prematurely harder to fine with each passing day, while the constant deluge of mindlessness produced by the big studios becomes marketed ad nauseam over the course of decades. Stephen T. Kay made the kind of film that inspires filmmakers. The soundtrack - also becoming harder and harder to find - cannot be beat (It remained untouched from my CD player for months). Personally, I had never been a fan of jazz music before owning it.

While you may have problems with the narrative structure, those of us who are great beat literature enthusiasts recognize that the jump cut style of the narrative already existed and was brought to life in this film in a fantastic manner.

    You know, normally when you have a good script and excellent actors on your project, you can turn out something decent, good or great...even when you, as the director, believe you're talented and think you know what you're doing. But so far as "The Last Time I Committed Suicide" is concerned, Stephen T. Kay flat out ruined this movie, and it is damn near unforgivable. Here we have a screenplay filled with some of the most wonderful dialog you can imagine being delivered by a troupe of wonderful actors. Thomas Jane gives a star making turn as Neal Cassady, and he is backed up with a startlingly naturalistic and cozy turn by Keanu Reeves as his drunk buddy, Harry. But could you enjoy the beautiful rhythm of their work? Noooooooooo. By God, Mr. Kay was going to remind you every step of the way that he is DIRECTING this film and you are going to pay attention to that fact, come hell or high water. I mean, here we have a quiet intense drama about a charismatic man who inspired people like Jack Kerouac and Alan Ginsberg, and the director uses every trick in "The MTV Bible of Pseudo Filmography" to hide that fact and (supposedly) make it palatable for the ADD generation. You got your jump cuts and edits every .9 seconds and odd angles and pretty inserts and on and on and on until I finally wanted to scream at the screen, "Take a F*****G valium!" Drama has to unfold; it cannot be force fed down your gullet because the man making the movie thinks you're too easily distracted to give a damn about the characters. I've only seen one other movie where the director completely destroyed a wonderful script -- "A Chorus of Disapproval" (although if "While You Were Sleeping" had had any other actress in the lead besides Sandra Bullock, it would also fit in this cursed category). So...if you like your drama spit out in food fight fashion, then this is the movie for you. But if you want anything approaching reality, check out something like "La Dolce Vita" by Federico Fellini, who has more style in his right pinkie than in all of Stephen T. Kay's body.

    I am writing this because I am in stark disagreement with a certain editor. This little film shows excellent directing, cinematography and acting. It stands as testimony against, and is infinitely better then, most of the talentless "indie" wastes of time that you'll see in the country's smaller theaters today. Thomas Jane BECOMES a young Neal Cassady, and displays one of the finer performances you'll ever see on film. In fact, the acting is excellent overall (To which the director should be praised). Admittedly, if you are interested in the legend of Neal Cassady this movie is going to be much more interesting to you. Still, even if you are not, it is a fine story of unrequited love, with humor and the spirit of the enjoyment of life. It is a touching period piece, excellently delivered and exceptionally written. The other Cassady-driven movie (unrelated to this cast and crew) - "Heart Beat" (1980) - hits you like a stale yellow lamp on a boring Sunday afternoon by comparison. This film is vivid and beautiful. It is a shame that a film of this caliber is being ignorantly shuffled under the carpet, becoming prematurely harder to fine with each passing day, while the constant deluge of mindlessness produced by the big studios becomes marketed ad nauseam over the course of decades. Stephen T. Kay made the kind of film that inspires filmmakers. The soundtrack - also becoming harder and harder to find - cannot be beat (It remained untouched from my CD player for months). Personally, I had never been a fan of jazz music before owning it.

    To clear up any misconceptions, it's based on the Cherry Mary letter to Kerouac(not Ginsberg) and the Reeves character isn't supposed to be Kerouac, he's supposed to be one of Cassady's old Denver pool hall buddies. If you recall the beginning of the movie, Cassady is writing this story to Kerouac(it's the letter, get it?) why would he be telling Kerouac a story that Kerouac was such a big part of? Plus, Kerouac, though he liked to drink, wasn't like that at all. Although I do believe that Benjamin is based on Ginsberg. Even though the nameless guy from the letter that he represents wasn't Ginsberg, I think Kay took the opportunity of a blank-slate character to make a Ginsberg character(I base this on the attitude of the character, the obvious crush he has on Cassady, and the race car story that Cassady tells him which is a story Cassady told Ginsberg orally in reality that Ginsberg jotted down and that you can find in Cassady's book, The First Third), which is a great idea. Except that Adrian Brody stands firmly as my least favorite Allen Ginsberg portrayal of all time. He did not capture Ginsberg's brand of warmth and sweetness even slightly. The writing cannot be blamed for how annoying Brody played him. See the Ginsberg portrayals in Naked Lunch and I'm Not There for very good Ginsbergs by Michael Zelniker and David Cross. What makes up for Adrian Brody's Ginsberg is Tom Jane's Cassady which is spot on. The way he spoke and moved was perfect. Just short of watching Cassady himself. It was strange to see such good acting and such bad acting right next to each other. Unlike Naked Lunch(Which I think anybody who likes a good movie can easily enjoy) I understand how anyone who doesn't know and like the Beats wouldn't really dig this movie. However it was a lot of fun for me to watch and it will be the next time I watch it too. I don't know if anyone noticed, but in addition to all the lines taken from the letter it's based on, there was lines taken from other stuff Cassady wrote too! Like I said, the race car story he tells Benjamin is a story he told Allen and there is the best line from one of my favorite Cassady/Ginsberg letters: "I see no greatness in myself--I even have no conception of what is greatness. I am a simple-minded, child-like, insipid sort of moronic kind of awkward-feeling adolescent." which is not quoted directly in the movie, as it is in this here review, but it's in there! And I believe the Adventures in Auto Eroticism story is in there too? Probably other stuff I'm forgetting. Anyway, Stephen Kay clearly knows his stuff when it comes to these guys and I don't think the script lacked wit at all, I thought it was natural, especially considering how many of the lines were quotes, I think he mixed them pretty well into his own writing(Although I wouldn't say quite as well a Cronenberg did in Naked Lunch). Also check out Tom Jane in Arrested Development!

    To appreciate this film the viewer needs either to be in a jazzy, rebellious sort of mood, or have some interest in Neal Cassady, an American who figured heavily in the development of the "beat generation" of the 1950s. Set in the 1940s during one notable period of Cassady's life, the film is mostly a character study of Cassady (Thomas Jane), and his relationship with other people in his life, including his friend Harry (Keanu Reeves) and various romantic interests, the central one being Joan (Claire Forlani). But Cassady was a quirky kind of guy, a rebel, a nonconformist, fun loving, with a restless energy, a person constantly on the move, both physically and philosophically. As presented in the film, he is a cross between James Dean and Jim Morrison. Cassady's offbeat personality is mirrored in the film's offbeat style. It's shot partly in color and partly in B&W. Plot structure seems deliberately chaotic, frenetic, loose. Jump cuts can be jarring for viewers expecting a smoothly flowing, linear plot. And the tone alternates between silly and philosophical. Background music is mostly jazz with some blues thrown in. Accordingly, a lot of viewers will find the film's unorthodox style off-putting. But I liked it, for the most part. The plot would have been stronger if it had focused on Cassady's 1950s relationship with other historical figures, like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, instead of his romances with random women. Otherwise, the cinematography, the music, and the performance of Thomas Jane are terrific.

    One of the most surprising things in "The Last Time I Committed Suicide" is the whole part about Neal Cassady's thoughts about living the "ideal" American life (a nuclear family and a house surrounded by a white picket fence). Cassady was one of the major people in the Beat generation, which rejected the "Leave It to Beaver" image of life. If in fact Cassady thought about having this kind of life, then it goes to show his own conflicts, even beyond the main plot in this movie. But I digress. I think that the movie did a good job looking at Neal Cassady (Thomas Jane). He and Jack Kerouac remain two of the most important figures of the 20th century. Also starring Keanu Reeves, Marg Helgenberger and Gretchen Mol...and just take a look at that one scene of her! (you know which one I mean)

    The best thing about this movie is the opening scene, where Neal Cassady is doing more daydreaming and dancing then he is working on his writing. The beginning of the movie screams to Cassady's life, and shows the audience a Marlon Brando type character that had strong ties with folks like, Allen Ginsberg and Jake Kerouac. Cassady, a forgotten literary figure with more passion for creativity then progress in writing, would later become the character to drive the bus in Ken Kesey's, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. It is important to note, that while Cassady had only one decent literary publication, his zealous outlook on life was borrowed by some of the "great literary beat writers" in America. The Actor Keanu Reeves, who I have never been a huge fan of, does an excellent job of shedding light on Cassady's constant dissonance about leaving the life of a beat writer, for the life of a 9-5 working man with a stable house, beautiful wife, and loving family. The movie overall, is about this dissonance, is about the passion that Cassady had for both the creative life and the more stable environment of the family life. Sadly, Cassady was unable to find balance between the two. Do not expect, watching this movie that it will touch your life with a "wow-effect" forever. It is not some type of magical-beat-generation-movie that you can philosophize about for hours, it is just a pretty good movie. What you can keep with you forever, however, is the soundtrack to this movie, The Last Time I Committed Suicide. With scores of music from folks like, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Tyler Bates, Ella Fitzgerald and Charles Mingus, this soundtrack is sure visit any jazz lovers CD player often.

    The most disappointing thing about this movie is that it has no literary value. There is no story to speak of, Neal Cassady's life is pathetically boring, and the dialog is without any wit at all. We follow Neal Cassady -- who is supposed to be 20 but looks 30 -- swap girlfriends and hangs out with some losers, including some totally unrecognizable Beat poets. The actors are doing their best but the script they are grappling with is empty. It's pretty girls and pretty boys, and pretty boring. No wit, and, worst of all, no beat! Neal Cassady : a would-be James Dean without a cause and indeed without a rebellion!

    How can a film with a dream cast that includes Keanu Reeves, Adrien Brody, Marg Helgenberger, Gretchen Mol and Amy Smart go wrong? Try bad script and even worse direction. You might begin to consider suicide yourself about half an hour in. Thomas Jane headlines the cast as Neal Cassady in this headache inducing film biog. He's probably the weakest of the performers involved. But he certainly gets no help from director Stephen Kay who seems more interested in showing off his camera tricks and technique than actually directing actors and making scenes work. When this film isn't painful, its a bore. There is a reason you've never heard of "The Last Time I Committed Suicide". Be grateful and avoid if at all possible.

    The Last Time is a factual look into the life of the Beat Generation's Neal Cassady. It's based upon a letter (the Joan Anderson letter) from Neal Cassady to Jack Kerouac. The scenes are fragmentary, jittery, jazz-punctuated, syncopated, improvised, and skittery; this is the same style in which the Beat writers penned their poems, prose, and personal letters, and it makes the viewer feel as if he/she is reading Beat poetry while watching the film. When the film opens, Cassady is struggling with the aftermath of his girlfriend's attempted suicide. He begins to examine the battle between his own desire to roam free and write, and her desire to live the American dream (marriage, house). Overwhelmed, he plunges headfirst into his own desires... Along the way, Neal realizes that life choices are permanent, for better or for worse. Keanu Reeves appears briefly as Beat writer Jack Kerouac, silky and smooth, who helps Neal smooth out his rough edges. The soundtrack is excellent, and a must have for anyone who likes Jazz. The brilliant, landmark Jazz featured is the soundtrack of the Beats themselves, lively, progressive, explosive, the compositions infinite in possibilities.

    Anyone who has actually read any of the beat narratives, in particular Kerouac and Cassady prose, would agree that the film comes as close to encapsulating the language and overall style onto film as possible. I agree the film does adhere to a certain MTV aesthetic, but whose to say that the aesthetic didn't already exist before it was given that name? One could argue that Neal Cassady himself was one of the more well known ADD characters of late fifties literature, if not all literature, with his penchant for the next free drink of booze, the next broad, jumping from stolen car to stolen car, even ditching his friends (in Mexico in On the Road) if the need arose. While you may have problems with the narrative structure, those of us who are great beat literature enthusiasts recognize that the jump cut style of the narrative already existed and was brought to life in this film in a fantastic manner.
