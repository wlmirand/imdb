 <sinopse>
  When letters written to God start getting results, and replies, people everywhere are amazed. The Post Office however is annoyed.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Tom Turner is a con man, defrauding people from their money with a variety of two-bit hustles. One night he makes the mistake of attempting to hustle some undercover cops, and finds himself in court faced with the dilemma of either going to jail or getting a real job. Choosing to stay out of jail, he gets a job at the post office working in their Dead Letter Office helping to sort Dead Letters (i.e. mail which, for whatever reason, can't be delivered). Some of the mail he recieves can't be delivered because it's addressed to God, and he accidentally answers (sending them money in the process). This starts the ball rolling as more of his co-workers get in on the idea of helping people by answering "God" mail.

    Greg Kinnear plays a compulsive gambler who is in debt to a loan shark. He must get a job after appearing in court and getting offered a choice between going to jail and getting that job. He winds up at the Post Office for the Christmas period and when he inadvertently opens up a letter to God. For some reason he decides to answer it with some jewelry he steals from the Post Office dead letter files. When he sends his cashed paycheck along it is an accident and he chases it but can't get it. The rest of the dead letter staff gets the spirit and things keep giving. There are several well known actors in this movie and they do an excellent job. Tim Conway, Laurie Metcalf, Hector Elizondo (although it is a reach to see a Hispanic having to portray what I guess is suppose to be a Russian accent), and Roscoe Lee Brown. When Brown gets pinched for giving a horn to a bum musician he gets grabbed by the Feds. Greg comes forward and says he did it all. At trial the whole gang comes forth and states they are the leader. Of course all ends well for the good guys.

    Greg Kinnear is Tom Turner, small time con artist who apparently never works, gambles, loses, and is forever in debt. He gets a few bucks here, a few bucks there, working any number of scams. Until police on a sting catch him trying to sell worthless airline tickets to what he thinks are a foreign couple. He is arrested, and in court is given a choice -- get and hold a job for at least a year, or go to prison. |He had to think about it, but took the job option. The judge figured he needed to experience how it was to work for money, since he was accustomed to taking what others had worked for. He manages to get a job with the post office, in the DLO -- the dead letter office. That's where letters to such personalities as Elvis, Santa, and GOD went. Still having 'scam' firmly in his mind, part of his scheme was to eventually get money from the letters. But first he had to do something fantastic. A Garry Marshall film. Tim Conway is his usual funny self, as Herman Dooly, a mail man who was assigned inside duty after he bit a dog. Hector Elizondo is good as the supervisor, Vladek Vidov. SPOILERS. Under Tom's influence, they begin to select letters to GOD, open them, and find people to help. As a result lots of money often came in. |Gradually Tom had a change of heart, began to reject his dishonest life and see the benefit of doing good. However he went to trial again, for violating postal regulations, in opening mail. Everyone rallied to his support, he got off, and got the girl too.

    I wish there was a rating between "Liked it" and "Didn't Like It". Because although I didn't DISlike this movie, I can't actually say I LIKED it either. Very lame and weak in a lot of places - Tim Conway gives a GREAT performance as the burned out postal worker. The other performances are just adequate, and that's being kind. I am big fan of Laurie Metcalfe, but this is not a shining moment for her. Ellen Cleghorn's attempt at an accent fails miserably, and Greg Kinnear is not believable as a bad guy. The premise of the story is cute.....but the story sputters to it's predictable ending...and takes too long to get there.

    sorry this may not be for cynics at heart, but if in for a LightHearted less seriousness laugh of it all...non conforming but simulative... it was quite funny with a long-term feel ideal in a markable way...just stumbling onto this film from a Canadian inside-workers perspective and insiders-production's views, offers insiders laugh and a half, outdated in areas of course, but... it has splitting laughter parts that can be watched over and over and or feeling down-times brings a simple uplift if one does not come into it with an already harsh-eye...yes, sentimentally-sappish in a sheepish way, hints of gmashall-comedy to the fans and similar details of kinnear humorous-ways of the past. It is what it is and they are who they are...just on screen, for it's environment. It's a search to stumble upon, as myself, to make this lost past treasure into simplicity, hints and twists on Santa wishes/wishes as Be-wishes in an angelical light-miracle adult-sense of pay it forward ways with fittingly music to round it off...postmarked and mailed...make that emailed :) to scape into chuckles when you need an uplift in a different light, rather non-dark to note. Thumbs up in letters!

    A throw-a-away script & actors sleep walking through it, too. Silly, silly, silly for children, maybe?! Human being with minds, please stay away. Stupid, stupid & more stupid. Insipid, insipid, insipid. No tension, no surprises, no logic, no wonder you haven't heard of it! No ideas. No humor, "no nothing." No good. Not funny, not fun, not cool. I was forced to watch this by my "friend" at work; gee, thanks! Got it in the bargain basement bin; gee, I wonder why? "Great flick," hun?? Why not use your time wisely, like read, walk or walk into walks instead? I'd rather walk off into the ocean, than watch this again. Sorry; just trying to meet the length guidelines!

    Tom (Greg Kinnear) is a petty conman who poses as a burn victim (among other things) to elicit money from innocent bystanders. He has quite a reputation around town so law enforcement goes to some length to catch him in the act. Brought in front of a judge, she decrees that he will get a real job or end up in the pokey. So, a job it is for him. Tom has his eye on a pretty lady named Gloria, anyway, so it might help his image with her, too. Strings are pulled to get him into the postal service's dead letter office. Once there, surrounded by kind and interesting people, he begins to turn his life around. He even reads some of the letters addressed to God and performs random acts of kindness. What could be wrong with that? This movie leaves the viewer with feelings of great joy. Kinnear is a charmer, in every way, and with cast members such as Maria Pitillo, Tim Conway, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Hector Elizondo, he is in great company. The script has a buoyant message to give about helping others, only to receive kindness back in return. How nice the settings and costumes are, too. A love story develops quietly for any viewer who longs for comedies with romance. This film is recommended for individuals or families who need their faith restored in humanity, but who also enjoy laughter and nonsense along the way.

    A film like this is only on at one time of the year. Although it's about letters to God rather than Santa Claus, its theme of dreams coming true and its vague sentimentality are just right for the holiday season. The film is about a bunch of misfits and loners discovering a social conscience when they work in a department of the postal service that handles letters addressed to God and other people who don't have regular mailing addresses. This is certainly no ask-god version of Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts (filmed as Advice to the Lovelorn and Miss Lonelyhearts), where a character faced with innumerable demands from desperate members of the public is slowly driven mad. It seems there are few problems in this film that cannot be solved with a misappropriated saxophone (indeed, with all the gifts being doled out, the film's idea of God is little different to Father Christmas). Wider issues of poverty, illness, death and other injustices are ignored. As an atheist, I was a little disappointed to see people talking about God inspiring the characters, as though nobody could do a good deed without being an agent of the Lord. It seems odd that a film with a potentially blasphemous premise (people impersonating God) could end up as such an affirmation of religion, but in the cinema people who impersonate priests and nuns tend to end up as heroes (We're No Angels, etc) while actual priests turn out to be villains. This film certainly panders to the audience's need for a feel-good spirituality that is simple and undemanding, without any of the complexities of organised religion. To be fair, the crew and cast are competent and while it's not Garry Marshall's best film, it's not his most shamelessly manipulative either (Pretty Woman is far stupider). The characters are an appealingly motley bunch that could work well in a sitcom, some of the dialogue is funny, and Dear God is in many ways a decent piece of schmaltz. If you forget about it as soon as it's finished, it's probably fine.

    "Dear God" is a movie the whole family can enjoy. Despite a predictable plot and an ending anyone can spot a mile away, the overall ensemble acting and dialogue are surprisingly fresh and sometimes poignant. The conversion of Tom from a conniving con who thought of every angle to profit himself to a do-gooder is gradual and quite convincing, avoiding a common pitfall of many feel-good movies. Jaded cynics may sneer at the religious tone, but it is actually not about any religion but about the uplifting experience one can gain by helping each other. The cast of Kinnear, Metcalf, Pitillo mixed with old pros like Conway, Elizondo and Browne really deliver. Conway is especially enjoyable, a scene stealer up to his old tricks, and Metcalf is deliriously wacky. A special mention goes to the director, Gary Marshall, using subtle yet funny touch to parody the American media and court system. Overall, this movie is very delightful for everyone who is not a total cynic. Rating: 8/10.

    "Dear God" is so painstakingly boring, manipulative and predictable it's hard to watch despite some decent yet watered down performances by those onboard the project. Greg Kinnear plays a young slacker who is innocently arrested and sentenced to finding a job--yes, finding a job--by the bad guy from "Total Recall," who doesn't look like he's having a very good time making this movie. Kinnear takes a job at a local post office and gets a spot in the Dead Letter Department, where all the letters to Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, and God are sorted and thrown out. But as Kinnear avoids his odd co-workers, he finds himself wanting to respond to the "Dear God" letters, hence the title of the film--big surprise--"Dear God." Kinnear's character is extremely obnoxious and annoying. At times the filmmakers want us to feel sorry for the Innocent Young Man Going Through Turbulent Times, but then the character does things that are inexcusibly ignorant and unbiased. For example, take a scene where Kinnear is on trial. We're supposed to feel sorry for him. But the next moment he's up in the judge's face making wise cracks and disobeying all courtroom procedures. This is supposed to amuse the audience. Yeah, right. The film's jokes are about as tired as every other average comedy out there. Too many scenes do not expand to their full potential, and instead we get scenes like the "Stand behind the yellow line" gag that not only goes on WAYYY too long, but has been done a million times before in a million different films. The characters are not only weak, but one-dimensional and totally distant: We can't feel for any of them one way or another. The characters' dialogue is about as stiff and stereotypical as it can get: You feel like the writers were trying to think of corny dialogue. And boy, if that's what they were looking for, they got it right. "Dear God" had a good premise with promising potential, but due to a half-baked, sentimentally-controlling script, unlikable characters and an awful sense of humor, this film fails miserably at what it promises us. 1.5/5 stars - John Ulmer

This is supposed to amuse the audience. Yeah, right. The film's jokes are about as tired as every other average comedy out there. Too many scenes do not expand to their full potential, and instead we get scenes like the "Stand behind the yellow line" gag that not only goes on WAYYY too long, but has been done a million times before in a million different films. The characters are not only weak, but one-dimensional and totally distant: We can't feel for any of them one way or another. The characters' dialogue is about as stiff and stereotypical as it can get: You feel like the writers were trying to think of corny dialogue. And boy, if that's what they were looking for, they got it right. "Dear God" had a good premise with promising potential, but due to a half-baked, sentimentally-controlling script, unlikable characters and an awful sense of humor, this film fails miserably at what it promises us. 1.5/5 stars - John Ulmer

    Greg Kinnear plays a compulsive gambler who is in debt to a loan shark. He must get a job after appearing in court and getting offered a choice between going to jail and getting that job. He winds up at the Post Office for the Christmas period and when he inadvertently opens up a letter to God. For some reason he decides to answer it with some jewelry he steals from the Post Office dead letter files. When he sends his cashed paycheck along it is an accident and he chases it but can't get it. The rest of the dead letter staff gets the spirit and things keep giving. There are several well known actors in this movie and they do an excellent job. Tim Conway, Laurie Metcalf, Hector Elizondo (although it is a reach to see a Hispanic having to portray what I guess is suppose to be a Russian accent), and Roscoe Lee Brown. When Brown gets pinched for giving a horn to a bum musician he gets grabbed by the Feds. Greg comes forward and says he did it all. At trial the whole gang comes forth and states they are the leader. Of course all ends well for the good guys.

    Greg Kinnear is Tom Turner, small time con artist who apparently never works, gambles, loses, and is forever in debt. He gets a few bucks here, a few bucks there, working any number of scams. Until police on a sting catch him trying to sell worthless airline tickets to what he thinks are a foreign couple. He is arrested, and in court is given a choice -- get and hold a job for at least a year, or go to prison. |He had to think about it, but took the job option. The judge figured he needed to experience how it was to work for money, since he was accustomed to taking what others had worked for. He manages to get a job with the post office, in the DLO -- the dead letter office. That's where letters to such personalities as Elvis, Santa, and GOD went. Still having 'scam' firmly in his mind, part of his scheme was to eventually get money from the letters. But first he had to do something fantastic. A Garry Marshall film. Tim Conway is his usual funny self, as Herman Dooly, a mail man who was assigned inside duty after he bit a dog. Hector Elizondo is good as the supervisor, Vladek Vidov. SPOILERS. Under Tom's influence, they begin to select letters to GOD, open them, and find people to help. As a result lots of money often came in. |Gradually Tom had a change of heart, began to reject his dishonest life and see the benefit of doing good. However he went to trial again, for violating postal regulations, in opening mail. Everyone rallied to his support, he got off, and got the girl too.

    I wish there was a rating between "Liked it" and "Didn't Like It". Because although I didn't DISlike this movie, I can't actually say I LIKED it either. Very lame and weak in a lot of places - Tim Conway gives a GREAT performance as the burned out postal worker. The other performances are just adequate, and that's being kind. I am big fan of Laurie Metcalfe, but this is not a shining moment for her. Ellen Cleghorn's attempt at an accent fails miserably, and Greg Kinnear is not believable as a bad guy. The premise of the story is cute.....but the story sputters to it's predictable ending...and takes too long to get there.

    sorry this may not be for cynics at heart, but if in for a LightHearted less seriousness laugh of it all...non conforming but simulative... it was quite funny with a long-term feel ideal in a markable way...just stumbling onto this film from a Canadian inside-workers perspective and insiders-production's views, offers insiders laugh and a half, outdated in areas of course, but... it has splitting laughter parts that can be watched over and over and or feeling down-times brings a simple uplift if one does not come into it with an already harsh-eye...yes, sentimentally-sappish in a sheepish way, hints of gmashall-comedy to the fans and similar details of kinnear humorous-ways of the past. It is what it is and they are who they are...just on screen, for it's environment. It's a search to stumble upon, as myself, to make this lost past treasure into simplicity, hints and twists on Santa wishes/wishes as Be-wishes in an angelical light-miracle adult-sense of pay it forward ways with fittingly music to round it off...postmarked and mailed...make that emailed :) to scape into chuckles when you need an uplift in a different light, rather non-dark to note. Thumbs up in letters!

    A throw-a-away script & actors sleep walking through it, too. Silly, silly, silly for children, maybe?! Human being with minds, please stay away. Stupid, stupid & more stupid. Insipid, insipid, insipid. No tension, no surprises, no logic, no wonder you haven't heard of it! No ideas. No humor, "no nothing." No good. Not funny, not fun, not cool. I was forced to watch this by my "friend" at work; gee, thanks! Got it in the bargain basement bin; gee, I wonder why? "Great flick," hun?? Why not use your time wisely, like read, walk or walk into walks instead? I'd rather walk off into the ocean, than watch this again. Sorry; just trying to meet the length guidelines!

    Tom (Greg Kinnear) is a petty conman who poses as a burn victim (among other things) to elicit money from innocent bystanders. He has quite a reputation around town so law enforcement goes to some length to catch him in the act. Brought in front of a judge, she decrees that he will get a real job or end up in the pokey. So, a job it is for him. Tom has his eye on a pretty lady named Gloria, anyway, so it might help his image with her, too. Strings are pulled to get him into the postal service's dead letter office. Once there, surrounded by kind and interesting people, he begins to turn his life around. He even reads some of the letters addressed to God and performs random acts of kindness. What could be wrong with that? This movie leaves the viewer with feelings of great joy. Kinnear is a charmer, in every way, and with cast members such as Maria Pitillo, Tim Conway, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Hector Elizondo, he is in great company. The script has a buoyant message to give about helping others, only to receive kindness back in return. How nice the settings and costumes are, too. A love story develops quietly for any viewer who longs for comedies with romance. This film is recommended for individuals or families who need their faith restored in humanity, but who also enjoy laughter and nonsense along the way.

    A film like this is only on at one time of the year. Although it's about letters to God rather than Santa Claus, its theme of dreams coming true and its vague sentimentality are just right for the holiday season. The film is about a bunch of misfits and loners discovering a social conscience when they work in a department of the postal service that handles letters addressed to God and other people who don't have regular mailing addresses. This is certainly no ask-god version of Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts (filmed as Advice to the Lovelorn and Miss Lonelyhearts), where a character faced with innumerable demands from desperate members of the public is slowly driven mad. It seems there are few problems in this film that cannot be solved with a misappropriated saxophone (indeed, with all the gifts being doled out, the film's idea of God is little different to Father Christmas). Wider issues of poverty, illness, death and other injustices are ignored. As an atheist, I was a little disappointed to see people talking about God inspiring the characters, as though nobody could do a good deed without being an agent of the Lord. It seems odd that a film with a potentially blasphemous premise (people impersonating God) could end up as such an affirmation of religion, but in the cinema people who impersonate priests and nuns tend to end up as heroes (We're No Angels, etc) while actual priests turn out to be villains. This film certainly panders to the audience's need for a feel-good spirituality that is simple and undemanding, without any of the complexities of organised religion. To be fair, the crew and cast are competent and while it's not Garry Marshall's best film, it's not his most shamelessly manipulative either (Pretty Woman is far stupider). The characters are an appealingly motley bunch that could work well in a sitcom, some of the dialogue is funny, and Dear God is in many ways a decent piece of schmaltz. If you forget about it as soon as it's finished, it's probably fine.

    "Dear God" is a movie the whole family can enjoy. Despite a predictable plot and an ending anyone can spot a mile away, the overall ensemble acting and dialogue are surprisingly fresh and sometimes poignant. The conversion of Tom from a conniving con who thought of every angle to profit himself to a do-gooder is gradual and quite convincing, avoiding a common pitfall of many feel-good movies. Jaded cynics may sneer at the religious tone, but it is actually not about any religion but about the uplifting experience one can gain by helping each other. The cast of Kinnear, Metcalf, Pitillo mixed with old pros like Conway, Elizondo and Browne really deliver. Conway is especially enjoyable, a scene stealer up to his old tricks, and Metcalf is deliriously wacky. A special mention goes to the director, Gary Marshall, using subtle yet funny touch to parody the American media and court system. Overall, this movie is very delightful for everyone who is not a total cynic. Rating: 8/10.

    "Dear God" is so painstakingly boring, manipulative and predictable it's hard to watch despite some decent yet watered down performances by those onboard the project. Greg Kinnear plays a young slacker who is innocently arrested and sentenced to finding a job--yes, finding a job--by the bad guy from "Total Recall," who doesn't look like he's having a very good time making this movie. Kinnear takes a job at a local post office and gets a spot in the Dead Letter Department, where all the letters to Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, and God are sorted and thrown out. But as Kinnear avoids his odd co-workers, he finds himself wanting to respond to the "Dear God" letters, hence the title of the film--big surprise--"Dear God." Kinnear's character is extremely obnoxious and annoying. At times the filmmakers want us to feel sorry for the Innocent Young Man Going Through Turbulent Times, but then the character does things that are inexcusibly ignorant and unbiased. For example, take a scene where Kinnear is on trial. We're supposed to feel sorry for him. But the next moment he's up in the judge's face making wise cracks and disobeying all courtroom procedures. This is supposed to amuse the audience. Yeah, right. The film's jokes are about as tired as every other average comedy out there.
