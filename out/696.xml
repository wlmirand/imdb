    This is one of the best acted political films you will see. At the beginning you get a good idea of some of the wheeling and dealing the local politicians do just to get votes and keep various factions satisfied. There are four writers credited with the screenplay and three of those are recognised top drawer writers. It is obvious that the film has gone through various manifestations, gestations, rewrites and conceptual readjustments before a final, locked script emerged. The film dealing with a shooting that leaves a cop dead as well as an innocent child sets off a chain of events that leads to political skulduggery. While others might find the film hard going, even dense, there is no denying the quality of the acting.

    On the DVD cover of this movie, the Norwegian distributor had tagged as a "political thriller". It's about the intrigues and murders around the mayor of New York (played by Al Pacino), but is it a thriller? For me the first commandment for a thriller is excitement and good pace, and this movie lacks that. It is also a bit predictable. but I will describe it more like a political drama more than a thriller. I'm surely not an American, so I will not fully understand the political system in the US. What I pick up from newspapers and TV is almost all about corruption and fraud. Yes, this is a movie and not reality - but there's a touch of real life in every movie, there is a rotten apple in every basket, even in little Norway. my favorite actor Al Pacino gave a very good performance, although it's too quiet behind him. An extra point to John Cusack and Danny Aiello as well. On the other hand I got the feeling that I've seen the story before, the lone ranger and his girl fighting to expose the big political conspiracy, so I would like to see more originality in the plot. The advantage for betting on a well known horse such as Pacino is that they can't get too wrong - Pacino saved the movie, I'll blame the writers for the rest. There is a lot of skilled actors involved here, it's too bad they weren't able to show what they really can do; they to little to work with. But all in all this is not a bad movie, but I did feel a little disappointment - maybe I expected too much. But Al was good as always.

    I think this movie is among the best political ones to depict what I lived in France since 10 years and especially the last five ones: what's a corrupt democracy ? In those situations, the elected ones have indeed a fabulous live: for the public, they are real demagogues, making beautiful and moving speeches while in reality, they use their authority and public goods to serve their own private interest. The difference between this movie and my reality is that those American shameful politicians when caught red handed are quick to resign or worst while in my country, they are totally immune. So, beware, this isn't a simple movie: if you miss the beginning, it's hard to understand as the facts are speedy and come from everywhere. Thus, the audience runs in all the NYC boroughs and the movie is really alive and interesting. At last, the casting is wonderful: I never appreciated Aiello and I was happy to see him playing a bastard. Cusac is perfect as a idealistic young man, Bridget was a courageous and sympathetic lawyer and Al gives us something else than to be a cop and i'm sure Vito would be pleased!

    This film did not do well at the box office, probably because the drama is mostly in the dialog. There are a few tense moments, but most of the suspense and tension in the film come from Pacino's dynamic personality and Cusack's charm. Which is not to say the film is without merit. As a political thriller, it is probably more accurate in the way events are handled than most. You see the people in the mix, you see the steps that have to be taken, and you see the politics involved. Pacino's soliloquy at the funeral of the murdered child is nothing short of incredible, but soliloquy is what Al does best. Splendid performances by Aiello, Landau, Paymer, and Schiff fill out the plot with color and flair, and almost make up for the lackluster Fonda and the much too stereotypical Franciosa. Not at the top of my list, but definitely not at the bottom. Collectible if you are a lover of Pacino or Cusack, rated R for language and violence.

    Well, I will say this is the worst movie of Al Pacino, and this is not his mistake. I don't really know what the director was thinking while making the movie. If you have to make it a political drama, make one. But if you have to make it a murder mystery, than have it like that. I don't really know why people liked this movie so much (giving it 6 and 7 Rating, as it does not deserve it). This is simply a waste of time. People who want to watch the Political Dramas, they are well aware of the fact that the Politicians are far more intelligent than the ones shown in the story. And if they do bad things, they don't simply give up so easily. Everyone seemed to know what was happening, and no one seemed to react it. How come some one be so neglecting to incoming danger? It is natural for people having power to find the negative ways, and solve the issues, especially when they have already done something negative. It looks like they were all waiting for the climax to just pop up, and then say... 'Ah! What the..." For some reasons, the climax seemed to be obvious since the middle of the movie. 3/10 only for Al Pacino. I really liked the way he delivered his Passionate speeches. I won't say it was a completely boring movie, but many people won't enjoy it. I only did because of being Al-Pacino Frenzy.

    "Think of it as colours. There's black, and there's white, and in between is mostly grey. That's us. Now grey is a tough colour, because it's not as simple as black and white - and for the media, certainly not as interesting. But... it's what we are."  Mayor Pappas (Al Pacino) Al Pacino plays New York City mayor John Pappas, who at the height of his re-election campaign finds his office embroiled in a scandal resulting from the death of an African-American boy killed in a shoot-out between an undercover police officer and a Mafia kingpin's nephew. Pacino injects Shakespearean grandeur into his character. He is the Greek scion of the megalopolis, treating Pappas' life as a theatre show, feigning compassion and humanity when in reality he is a master of urban realpolitik. Part of the fun of the movie is observing the way Pappas operates, stroking egos, placating enemies, winking at his own manipulations. Always juggling balls (contracts, business deals etc) in the air, he's more concerned with "menschkeite" - a Yiddish phrase meaning the bonds of honour between men of power  than his City and its occupants. Of course, with the death of this six year old African-American boy, racial tensions begin to flair. Pretty soon an endless storm of finger-pointing begins to threaten to capsize the mayor's position, resulting in Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (played by John Cusack) going on a quest to find out what the slain cop was doing meeting the mobster whose bullet was responsible for the child's death. The film then develops into a fairly routine murder mystery in which the idealistic Kevin Calhoun gradually discovers the true nature of both his boss and the political world. This arc of the plot is wholly uninteresting, other than a beautiful scene in which Calhoun and Pappas square off in a tiny room and have a quiet discussion. On the surface, their conversation is about Pappas' journey from idealism to corruption, but look closer and you can see Pappas subtly manipulating Calhon, trying to influence the young Deputy Mayor into pardoning him whilst also hinting that Calhoun will one day suffer his own personal fall from grace. What's most unique about the film, though, is the way the unravelling of its central crime (the death of the six year old boy) is used to take us on an inside-the-network tour of New York City's political machinery. In other words, this is a less sophisticated, heavily truncated version of "The Wire". The difference is, where "The Wire" kept expanding and expanding until it seemed to encompass an entire neo-liberal city, "City Hall" remains focused only on the various arms of bureaucracy directly linked to mayoral politics. And like "The Wire", it attempts to look at how the political machine maintains power, how this power relates to different ethnic groups, and how the city turns otherwise well meaning human beings into budget-brained pragmatists with so many conflicting loyalties, constituencies, and priorities that the essence of compromise starts flowing naturally through their veins. In terms of style, the film was directed by Harold Becker, a journeyman director who has made several pretty good films ("Sea of Love", "Taps", "The Black Marble", "The Onion Fields", "Vision Quest"). His style is largely anonymous, which helps with this kind of material. The film has unnecessary (and jarring) narration during its opening and closing sequences, but for the most part it maintains a nice, restrained tone. 7.9/10 - "City Hall" was written by several heavyweight writers (Paul Schrader, Nicholas Pileggi, Bo Goldman and Ken Lipper, who was deputy mayor of New York under Ed Koch), all of whom help elevate this film. Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion piece to "The Contender", "Prince of the City" and "The Wire".

    Idealistic Louisiana-born John Cusack (as Kevin Calhoun) moves to New York City, where he impresses up-and-coming politician Al Pacino (as John Pappas) enough to become the Mayor's right hand man. The story begins with a shoot-out in Brooklyn, involving a gangster drug dealer and "off-duty" policeman. Unfortunately, an innocent six-year-old boy is shot dead in their crossfire. Naturally, this arouses a heightened interest in justice from the press, police, and public. Mayor Pacino tries to manage the unfolding drama with an eye on keeping his and Gotham City's reputation intact; he is considering a run for the White House, and is bidding on the upcoming Democratic Convention. Deputy Mayor Cusack joins the investigation, on his mentor's behalf. Pretty Bridget Fonda (as Marybeth Cogan) is added to up the feminine quotient, obviously; following one of the story's funerals, she and Cusack have a great car scene. Singing Rogers and Hammerstein songs, Danny Aiello (as Frank Anselmo) leads a terrific supporting cast. "City Hall" is so predictable, reviewers and studio publicity (like the DVD sleeve description) routinely hint at the film's big revelation; it was suppose to unravel slowly, but is painfully obvious too early on - in fact, the film's events, except for the opening boy's death, feel like a well-worn old pair of shoes. But, they are comfortable and fit nice. ******* City Hall (2/16/96) Harold Becker ~ John Cusack, Al Pacino, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello

    A Pileggi-Schrader Script In Which Silence Has Much More Inherent Meaning Than Speech.

    Working from a script written in part by Nicholas Pileggi, best known for writing the book Wiseguy, which he adapted into the movie Goodfellas, and for writing the book and screenplay Casino, director Harold Becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs, even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like Pappas, who is regarded as a presidential prospect. As Cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report, his skepticism is agitated. How did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence? We meet the other players in the plot, not the least of which is Danny Aiello, the political boss of Brooklyn, and Tony Franciosa, the Mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead. How and why these people are affiliated I leave to the movie to divulge, though there are never any misgivings that they are. The narrative is told generally through the eyes of the Cusack character, a visionary from Louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him. Much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations. Some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite, but considering I just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge, one can't say it doesn't work. The shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor's desk: a charge by Aiello for a subway stop and an off-ramp in Brooklyn to aid a new banking center, and the city's bid for the next Democratic convention. Individual idiosyncrasies are also explored, including Aiello's emotional bond with the music of Rogers and Hammerstein. Much also is made of menschkeit, a Yiddish expression, which, Pappas explains to his deputy, is about the bond of honor between two men, about what happens between the two hands in a handshake. This connection doesn't mean much to Bridget Fonda, the lawyer for the policeman's association who defends the dead cop's honor and fights for his widow's pension even as incriminating evidence appears. Little by little, the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law. There are various scenes of hard impact, including one where the Brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day, his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked, and then the Mafia boss drops in by surprise. There is also a compelling, and markedly conjectural, late scene between the mayor and his deputy. One scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child, in a Harlem church. His advisers tell him he won't be wanted there. But he goes anyway, and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole, Pacino and his character both. It gets an impressive reaction from the congregation, but the mayor knows, and his deputy knows, that it was artificial, and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it, in the limousine taking them away, is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo. This is a script that knows it has to supply Pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him, and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech. Pacino and Cusack are convincing together throughout the movie, the older man unbreakable and aware, the younger one anxious to learn, but with ideals that don't sway. Pacino is innate with his down-to-earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination, inspired flair and matter-of-fact realism. Cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness. The Bridget Fonda subplot development is unnecessary, but it is a result of veteran screenwriter Paul Schrader's otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character, and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments. Aiello, for instance, is a highlight because he evokes his character's joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment.

    ***SPOILERS*** When undercover Brooklyn North Det. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano,was to meet his drug supplier Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in a buy and bust operation, with Tito being the one who gets busted, that things went haywire with both Det. Santos and Tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other. During the deadly shootout an innocent bystander six year-old James Bone Jr.,Jaliyl Lynn,was also killed in the cross-fire. With New York City slated to host the 1996 Democratic Presidential Convention that summer that last thing that the city's flamboyant Mayor Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted was a possible riot over young James Bones tragic death by a possible, in was later determined that it was a bullet from Tito's gun that killed young James, member of the New York City Police Department. What was far more shocking then even Bone's death is that his killer Tito Zapatti was given probation by the well respected NY State Judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the backseat of his car! It soon became evident that the person who got Judge Stern his job, for a $50,000.00 payoff, was non other the Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It's Anselmo who's involved with Mayor Pappas in a land deal, involving the New York Subway System, that would bring him and his real estate friends tens of millions of dollars over the next two years! It would also indirectly connect Mayor Pappas in the Bone killing by connecting him to Judge Stern, who made it possible for Tito be be free, who's a mutual friend of both him and his Gomba, or Landsman, Frank Anselmo! To keep all this from blowing up the late Det. Santons is framed, by working undercover without the authority from his superiors, in the Bone shooting. In fact those framing Santos go as far and hiding some $40,000.00 in cash in his upstate summer home making it look like he was being paid off by Tito's uncle Mafia boss Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, for letting his nephew deal drugs with him getting a piece of the action. Which may well explain him, as well as Tito, getting shot by Tito welshing on his paying Santos off! As things turn out it's Mayor Pappas' deputy in City Hall Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, who ends up messing everything up for his boss by being too honest in finding who was responsible in covering up Tito's criminal record that allowed him to be out on the streets. The facts that Kevin uncovered lead straight to Frank Anselmo, a major political supporter of Mayor Pappas, who as it turned out was connected by the hip to Tito's Mafia chieftain Uncle Paul! A bit over-plotted "City Hall" does show how big city corruption can filter up, as well as down, to everyone in city government without them, like Mayor Pappas, even knowing about it. Mayor Pappas biggest sin was that he was friends with Brooklyn Boss Anselmo who was putting people into jobs, like Judge Stern, who were subjected to being blackmailed from Anselmo's real boss Mafioso Paul Zapatti. ***SPOILERS*** It only took a deadly shootout in Williamsburg to set everything into motion not by only Tito, besides Det. Santos and James Bone, being killed but why he was allowed to be out on the street in order to bring the very popular New York City Mayor down. Mayor Pappas was looking forward to much bigger things, like Governor or even President, in his future political pursuits. As it turned out his top deputy Kevin Calhoun in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise. As well as that of the Mayor's good friend Frank Anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench, as a state judge, Judge Stern. Who's decision in letting Tito Zapatti off made this whole disaster, which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide, possible!

    "Think of it as colours. There's black, and there's white, and in between is mostly grey. That's us. Now grey is a tough colour, because it's not as simple as black and white - and for the media, certainly not as interesting. But... it's what we are."  Mayor Pappas (Al Pacino) Al Pacino plays New York City mayor John Pappas, who at the height of his re-election campaign finds his office embroiled in a scandal resulting from the death of an African-American boy killed in a shoot-out between an undercover police officer and a Mafia kingpin's nephew. Pacino injects Shakespearean grandeur into his character. He is the Greek scion of the megalopolis, treating Pappas' life as a theatre show, feigning compassion and humanity when in reality he is a master of urban realpolitik. Part of the fun of the movie is observing the way Pappas operates, stroking egos, placating enemies, winking at his own manipulations. Always juggling balls (contracts, business deals etc) in the air, he's more concerned with "menschkeite" - a Yiddish phrase meaning the bonds of honour between men of power  than his City and its occupants. Of course, with the death of this six year old African-American boy, racial tensions begin to flair. Pretty soon an endless storm of finger-pointing begins to threaten to capsize the mayor's position, resulting in Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (played by John Cusack) going on a quest to find out what the slain cop was doing meeting the mobster whose bullet was responsible for the child's death. The film then develops into a fairly routine murder mystery in which the idealistic Kevin Calhoun gradually discovers the true nature of both his boss and the political world. This arc of the plot is wholly uninteresting, other than a beautiful scene in which Calhoun and Pappas square off in a tiny room and have a quiet discussion. On the surface, their conversation is about Pappas' journey from idealism to corruption, but look closer and you can see Pappas subtly manipulating Calhon, trying to influence the young Deputy Mayor into pardoning him whilst also hinting that Calhoun will one day suffer his own personal fall from grace. What's most unique about the film, though, is the way the unravelling of its central crime (the death of the six year old boy) is used to take us on an inside-the-network tour of New York City's political machinery. In other words, this is a less sophisticated, heavily truncated version of "The Wire". The difference is, where "The Wire" kept expanding and expanding until it seemed to encompass an entire neo-liberal city, "City Hall" remains focused only on the various arms of bureaucracy directly linked to mayoral politics. And like "The Wire", it attempts to look at how the political machine maintains power, how this power relates to different ethnic groups, and how the city turns otherwise well meaning human beings into budget-brained pragmatists with so many conflicting loyalties, constituencies, and priorities that the essence of compromise starts flowing naturally through their veins. In terms of style, the film was directed by Harold Becker, a journeyman director who has made several pretty good films ("Sea of Love", "Taps", "The Black Marble", "The Onion Fields", "Vision Quest"). His style is largely anonymous, which helps with this kind of material. The film has unnecessary (and jarring) narration during its opening and closing sequences, but for the most part it maintains a nice, restrained tone. 7.9/10 - "City Hall" was written by several heavyweight writers (Paul Schrader, Nicholas Pileggi, Bo Goldman and Ken Lipper, who was deputy mayor of New York under Ed Koch), all of whom help elevate this film. Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion piece to "The Contender", "Prince of the City" and "The Wire".

    Idealistic Louisiana-born John Cusack (as Kevin Calhoun) moves to New York City, where he impresses up-and-coming politician Al Pacino (as John Pappas) enough to become the Mayor's right hand man. The story begins with a shoot-out in Brooklyn, involving a gangster drug dealer and "off-duty" policeman. Unfortunately, an innocent six-year-old boy is shot dead in their crossfire. Naturally, this arouses a heightened interest in justice from the press, police, and public. Mayor Pacino tries to manage the unfolding drama with an eye on keeping his and Gotham City's reputation intact; he is considering a run for the White House, and is bidding on the upcoming Democratic Convention. Deputy Mayor Cusack joins the investigation, on his mentor's behalf. Pretty Bridget Fonda (as Marybeth Cogan) is added to up the feminine quotient, obviously; following one of the story's funerals, she and Cusack have a great car scene. Singing Rogers and Hammerstein songs, Danny Aiello (as Frank Anselmo) leads a terrific supporting cast. "City Hall" is so predictable, reviewers and studio publicity (like the DVD sleeve description) routinely hint at the film's big revelation; it was suppose to unravel slowly, but is painfully obvious too early on - in fact, the film's events, except for the opening boy's death, feel like a well-worn old pair of shoes. But, they are comfortable and fit nice. ******* City Hall (2/16/96) Harold Becker ~ John Cusack, Al Pacino, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello

    Working from a script written in part by Nicholas Pileggi, best known for writing the book Wiseguy, which he adapted into the movie Goodfellas, and for writing the book and screenplay Casino, director Harold Becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs, even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like Pappas, who is regarded as a presidential prospect. As Cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report, his skepticism is agitated. How did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence? We meet the other players in the plot, not the least of which is Danny Aiello, the political boss of Brooklyn, and Tony Franciosa, the Mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead. How and why these people are affiliated I leave to the movie to divulge, though there are never any misgivings that they are. The narrative is told generally through the eyes of the Cusack character, a visionary from Louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him. Much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations. Some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite, but considering I just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge, one can't say it doesn't work. The shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor's desk: a charge by Aiello for a subway stop and an off-ramp in Brooklyn to aid a new banking center, and the city's bid for the next Democratic convention. Individual idiosyncrasies are also explored, including Aiello's emotional bond with the music of Rogers and Hammerstein. Much also is made of menschkeit, a Yiddish expression, which, Pappas explains to his deputy, is about the bond of honor between two men, about what happens between the two hands in a handshake. This connection doesn't mean much to Bridget Fonda, the lawyer for the policeman's association who defends the dead cop's honor and fights for his widow's pension even as incriminating evidence appears. Little by little, the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law. There are various scenes of hard impact, including one where the Brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day, his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked, and then the Mafia boss drops in by surprise. There is also a compelling, and markedly conjectural, late scene between the mayor and his deputy. One scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child, in a Harlem church. His advisers tell him he won't be wanted there. But he goes anyway, and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole, Pacino and his character both. It gets an impressive reaction from the congregation, but the mayor knows, and his deputy knows, that it was artificial, and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it, in the limousine taking them away, is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo. This is a script that knows it has to supply Pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him, and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech. Pacino and Cusack are convincing together throughout the movie, the older man unbreakable and aware, the younger one anxious to learn, but with ideals that don't sway. Pacino is innate with his down-to-earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination, inspired flair and matter-of-fact realism. Cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness. The Bridget Fonda subplot development is unnecessary, but it is a result of veteran screenwriter Paul Schrader's otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character, and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments. Aiello, for instance, is a highlight because he evokes his character's joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment.

    ***SPOILERS*** When undercover Brooklyn North Det. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano,was to meet his drug supplier Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in a buy and bust operation, with Tito being the one who gets busted, that things went haywire with both Det. Santos and Tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other. During the deadly shootout an innocent bystander six year-old James Bone Jr.,Jaliyl Lynn,was also killed in the cross-fire. With New York City slated to host the 1996 Democratic Presidential Convention that summer that last thing that the city's flamboyant Mayor Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted was a possible riot over young James Bones tragic death by a possible, in was later determined that it was a bullet from Tito's gun that killed young James, member of the New York City Police Department. What was far more shocking then even Bone's death is that his killer Tito Zapatti was given probation by the well respected NY State Judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the backseat of his car! It soon became evident that the person who got Judge Stern his job, for a $50,000.00 payoff, was non other the Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It's Anselmo who's involved with Mayor Pappas in a land deal, involving the New York Subway System, that would bring him and his real estate friends tens of millions of dollars over the next two years! It would also indirectly connect Mayor Pappas in the Bone killing by connecting him to Judge Stern, who made it possible for Tito be be free, who's a mutual friend of both him and his Gomba, or Landsman, Frank Anselmo! To keep all this from blowing up the late Det. Santons is framed, by working undercover without the authority from his superiors, in the Bone shooting. In fact those framing Santos go as far and hiding some $40,000.00 in cash in his upstate summer home making it look like he was being paid off by Tito's uncle Mafia boss Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, for letting his nephew deal drugs with him getting a piece of the action. Which may well explain him, as well as Tito, getting shot by Tito welshing on his paying Santos off! As things turn out it's Mayor Pappas' deputy in City Hall Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, who ends up messing everything up for his boss by being too honest in finding who was responsible in covering up Tito's criminal record that allowed him to be out on the streets. The facts that Kevin uncovered lead straight to Frank Anselmo, a major political supporter of Mayor Pappas, who as it turned out was connected by the hip to Tito's Mafia chieftain Uncle Paul! A bit over-plotted "City Hall" does show how big city corruption can filter up, as well as down, to everyone in city government without them, like Mayor Pappas, even knowing about it. Mayor Pappas biggest sin was that he was friends with Brooklyn Boss Anselmo who was putting people into jobs, like Judge Stern, who were subjected to being blackmailed from Anselmo's real boss Mafioso Paul Zapatti. ***SPOILERS*** It only took a deadly shootout in Williamsburg to set everything into motion not by only Tito, besides Det. Santos and James Bone, being killed but why he was allowed to be out on the street in order to bring the very popular New York City Mayor down. Mayor Pappas was looking forward to much bigger things, like Governor or even President, in his future political pursuits. As it turned out his top deputy Kevin Calhoun in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise. As well as that of the Mayor's good friend Frank Anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench, as a state judge, Judge Stern. Who's decision in letting Tito Zapatti off made this whole disaster, which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide, possible!

    This is one of the best acted political films you will see. At the beginning you get a good idea of some of the wheeling and dealing the local politicians do just to get votes and keep various factions satisfied. There are four writers credited with the screenplay and three of those are recognised top drawer writers. It is obvious that the film has gone through various manifestations, gestations, rewrites and conceptual readjustments before a final, locked script emerged. The film dealing with a shooting that leaves a cop dead as well as an innocent child sets off a chain of events that leads to political skulduggery. While others might find the film hard going, even dense, there is no denying the quality of the acting.

    living in jersey for over 10 years and visiting n y c , i am very fond of this film,, John Cusack knocks the ball out of the park with this one, possibly his greatest work,, save for the Jack Bull. a little boy get's killed by in a shootout between a dirty cop and a gangster, john plays the deputy mayor,, brigette fonda is excellent in this film as well playing opposite john,, Al Pacino plays the Mayor of the great city of New York City who buy the way is also trying to get the Democratic National Convention to come there instead of Miami, so there is a lot of political wheeling and dealing there,, this film is a fascinating look at political life in the big city, and what happens between gangsters and politicians..

    On the DVD cover of this movie, the Norwegian distributor had tagged as a "political thriller". It's about the intrigues and murders around the mayor of New York (played by Al Pacino), but is it a thriller? For me the first commandment for a thriller is excitement and good pace, and this movie lacks that. It is also a bit predictable. but I will describe it more like a political drama more than a thriller. I'm surely not an American, so I will not fully understand the political system in the US. What I pick up from newspapers and TV is almost all about corruption and fraud. Yes, this is a movie and not reality - but there's a touch of real life in every movie, there is a rotten apple in every basket, even in little Norway. my favorite actor Al Pacino gave a very good performance, although it's too quiet behind him. An extra point to John Cusack and Danny Aiello as well. On the other hand I got the feeling that I've seen the story before, the lone ranger and his girl fighting to expose the big political conspiracy, so I would like to see more originality in the plot. The advantage for betting on a well known horse such as Pacino is that they can't get too wrong - Pacino saved the movie, I'll blame the writers for the rest. There is a lot of skilled actors involved here, it's too bad they weren't able to show what they really can do; they to little to work with. But all in all this is not a bad movie, but I did feel a little disappointment - maybe I expected too much. But Al was good as always.

    I think this movie is among the best political ones to depict what I lived in France since 10 years and especially the last five ones: what's a corrupt democracy ? In those situations, the elected ones have indeed a fabulous live: for the public, they are real demagogues, making beautiful and moving speeches while in reality, they use their authority and public goods to serve their own private interest. The difference between this movie and my reality is that those American shameful politicians when caught red handed are quick to resign or worst while in my country, they are totally immune. So, beware, this isn't a simple movie: if you miss the beginning, it's hard to understand as the facts are speedy and come from everywhere. Thus, the audience runs in all the NYC boroughs and the movie is really alive and interesting. At last, the casting is wonderful: I never appreciated Aiello and I was happy to see him playing a bastard. Cusac is perfect as a idealistic young man, Bridget was a courageous and sympathetic lawyer and Al gives us something else than to be a cop and i'm sure Vito would be pleased!

    This film did not do well at the box office, probably because the drama is mostly in the dialog. There are a few tense moments, but most of the suspense and tension in the film come from Pacino's dynamic personality and Cusack's charm. Which is not to say the film is without merit. As a political thriller, it is probably more accurate in the way events are handled than most. You see the people in the mix, you see the steps that have to be taken, and you see the politics involved. Pacino's soliloquy at the funeral of the murdered child is nothing short of incredible, but soliloquy is what Al does best. Splendid performances by Aiello, Landau, Paymer, and Schiff fill out the plot with color and flair, and almost make up for the lackluster Fonda and the much too stereotypical Franciosa. Not at the top of my list, but definitely not at the bottom. Collectible if you are a lover of Pacino or Cusack, rated R for language and violence.

    Well, I will say this is the worst movie of Al Pacino, and this is not his mistake. I don't really know what the director was thinking while making the movie. If you have to make it a political drama, make one. But if you have to make it a murder mystery, than have it like that. I don't really know why people liked this movie so much (giving it 6 and 7 Rating, as it does not deserve it). This is simply a waste of time. People who want to watch the Political Dramas, they are well aware of the fact that the Politicians are far more intelligent than the ones shown in the story. And if they do bad things, they don't simply give up so easily. Everyone seemed to know what was happening, and no one seemed to react it. How come some one be so neglecting to incoming danger? It is natural for people having power to find the negative ways, and solve the issues, especially when they have already done something negative. It looks like they were all waiting for the climax to just pop up, and then say... 'Ah! What the..." For some reasons, the climax seemed to be obvious since the middle of the movie. 3/10 only for Al Pacino. I really liked the way he delivered his Passionate speeches. I won't say it was a completely boring movie, but many people won't enjoy it. I only did because of being Al-Pacino Frenzy.

Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano,was to meet his drug supplier Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in a buy and bust operation, with Tito being the one who gets busted, that things went haywire with both Det. Santos and Tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other. During the deadly shootout an innocent bystander six year-old James Bone Jr.,Jaliyl Lynn,was also killed in the cross-fire. With New York City slated to host the 1996 Democratic Presidential Convention that summer that last thing that the city's flamboyant Mayor Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted was a possible riot over young James Bones tragic death by a possible, in was later determined that it was a bullet from Tito's gun that killed young James, member of the New York City Police Department. What was far more shocking then even Bone's death is that his killer Tito Zapatti was given probation by the well respected NY State Judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the backseat of his car! It soon became evident that the person who got Judge Stern his job, for a $50,000.00 payoff, was non other the Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It's Anselmo who's involved with Mayor Pappas in a land deal, involving the New York Subway System, that would bring him and his real estate friends tens of millions of dollars over the next two years! It would also indirectly connect Mayor Pappas in the Bone killing by connecting him to Judge Stern, who made it possible for Tito be be free, who's a mutual friend of both him and his Gomba, or Landsman, Frank Anselmo! To keep all this from blowing up the late Det. Santons is framed, by working undercover without the authority from his superiors, in the Bone shooting. In fact those framing Santos go as far and hiding some $40,000.00 in cash in his upstate summer home making it look like he was being paid off by Tito's uncle Mafia boss Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, for letting his nephew deal drugs with him getting a piece of the action. Which may well explain him, as well as Tito, getting shot by Tito welshing on his paying Santos off! As things turn out it's Mayor Pappas' deputy in City Hall Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, who ends up messing everything up for his boss by being too honest in finding who was responsible in covering up Tito's criminal record that allowed him to be out on the streets. The facts that Kevin uncovered lead straight to Frank Anselmo, a major political supporter of Mayor Pappas, who as it turned out was connected by the hip to Tito's Mafia chieftain Uncle Paul! A bit over-plotted "City Hall" does show how big city corruption can filter up, as well as down, to everyone in city government without them, like Mayor Pappas, even knowing about it. Mayor Pappas biggest sin was that he was friends with Brooklyn Boss Anselmo who was putting people into jobs, like Judge Stern, who were subjected to being blackmailed from Anselmo's real boss Mafioso Paul Zapatti. ***SPOILERS*** It only took a deadly shootout in Williamsburg to set everything into motion not by only Tito, besides Det. Santos and James Bone, being killed but why he was allowed to be out on the street in order to bring the very popular New York City Mayor down. Mayor Pappas was looking forward to much bigger things, like Governor or even President, in his future political pursuits. As it turned out his top deputy Kevin Calhoun in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise. As well as that of the Mayor's good friend Frank Anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench, as a state judge, Judge Stern. Who's decision in letting Tito Zapatti off made this whole disaster, which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide, possible!

    This is one of the best acted political films you will see. At the beginning you get a good idea of some of the wheeling and dealing the local politicians do just to get votes and keep various factions satisfied. There are four writers credited with the screenplay and three of those are recognised top drawer writers. It is obvious that the film has gone through various manifestations, gestations, rewrites and conceptual readjustments before a final, locked script emerged. The film dealing with a shooting that leaves a cop dead as well as an innocent child sets off a chain of events that leads to political skulduggery. While others might find the film hard going, even dense, there is no denying the quality of the acting.

    On the DVD cover of this movie, the Norwegian distributor had tagged as a "political thriller". It's about the intrigues and murders around the mayor of New York (played by Al Pacino), but is it a thriller? For me the first commandment for a thriller is excitement and good pace, and this movie lacks that. It is also a bit predictable. but I will describe it more like a political drama more than a thriller. I'm surely not an American, so I will not fully understand the political system in the US. What I pick up from newspapers and TV is almost all about corruption and fraud. Yes, this is a movie and not reality - but there's a touch of real life in every movie, there is a rotten apple in every basket, even in little Norway. my favorite actor Al Pacino gave a very good performance, although it's too quiet behind him. An extra point to John Cusack and Danny Aiello as well. On the other hand I got the feeling that I've seen the story before, the lone ranger and his girl fighting to expose the big political conspiracy, so I would like to see more originality in the plot. The advantage for betting on a well known horse such as Pacino is that they can't get too wrong - Pacino saved the movie, I'll blame the writers for the rest. There is a lot of skilled actors involved here, it's too bad they weren't able to show what they really can do; they to little to work with. But all in all this is not a bad movie, but I did feel a little disappointment - maybe I expected too much. But Al was good as always.

    I think this movie is among the best political ones to depict what I lived in France since 10 years and especially the last five ones: what's a corrupt democracy ? In those situations, the elected ones have indeed a fabulous live: for the public, they are real demagogues, making beautiful and moving speeches while in reality, they use their authority and public goods to serve their own private interest. The difference between this movie and my reality is that those American shameful politicians when caught red handed are quick to resign or worst while in my country, they are totally immune. So, beware, this isn't a simple movie: if you miss the beginning, it's hard to understand as the facts are speedy and come from everywhere. Thus, the audience runs in all the NYC boroughs and the movie is really alive and interesting. At last, the casting is wonderful: I never appreciated Aiello and I was happy to see him playing a bastard. Cusac is perfect as a idealistic young man, Bridget was a courageous and sympathetic lawyer and Al gives us something else than to be a cop and i'm sure Vito would be pleased!

    This film did not do well at the box office, probably because the drama is mostly in the dialog. There are a few tense moments, but most of the suspense and tension in the film come from Pacino's dynamic personality and Cusack's charm. Which is not to say the film is without merit. As a political thriller, it is probably more accurate in the way events are handled than most. You see the people in the mix, you see the steps that have to be taken, and you see the politics involved. Pacino's soliloquy at the funeral of the murdered child is nothing short of incredible, but soliloquy is what Al does best. Splendid performances by Aiello, Landau, Paymer, and Schiff fill out the plot with color and flair, and almost make up for the lackluster Fonda and the much too stereotypical Franciosa. Not at the top of my list, but definitely not at the bottom. Collectible if you are a lover of Pacino or Cusack, rated R for language and violence.

    Well, I will say this is the worst movie of Al Pacino, and this is not his mistake. I don't really know what the director was thinking while making the movie. If you have to make it a political drama, make one. But if you have to make it a murder mystery, than have it like that. I don't really know why people liked this movie so much (giving it 6 and 7 Rating, as it does not deserve it). This is simply a waste of time. People who want to watch the Political Dramas, they are well aware of the fact that the Politicians are far more intelligent than the ones shown in the story. And if they do bad things, they don't simply give up so easily. Everyone seemed to know what was happening, and no one seemed to react it. How come some one be so neglecting to incoming danger? It is natural for people having power to find the negative ways, and solve the issues, especially when they have already done something negative. It looks like they were all waiting for the climax to just pop up, and then say... 'Ah! What the..." For some reasons, the climax seemed to be obvious since the middle of the movie. 3/10 only for Al Pacino. I really liked the way he delivered his Passionate speeches. I won't say it was a completely boring movie, but many people won't enjoy it. I only did because of being Al-Pacino Frenzy.

    "Think of it as colours. There's black, and there's white, and in between is mostly grey. That's us. Now grey is a tough colour, because it's not as simple as black and white - and for the media, certainly not as interesting. But... it's what we are."  Mayor Pappas (Al Pacino) Al Pacino plays New York City mayor John Pappas, who at the height of his re-election campaign finds his office embroiled in a scandal resulting from the death of an African-American boy killed in a shoot-out between an undercover police officer and a Mafia kingpin's nephew. Pacino injects Shakespearean grandeur into his character. He is the Greek scion of the megalopolis, treating Pappas' life as a theatre show, feigning compassion and humanity when in reality he is a master of urban realpolitik. Part of the fun of the movie is observing the way Pappas operates, stroking egos, placating enemies, winking at his own manipulations. Always juggling balls (contracts, business deals etc) in the air, he's more concerned with "menschkeite" - a Yiddish phrase meaning the bonds of honour between men of power  than his City and its occupants. Of course, with the death of this six year old African-American boy, racial tensions begin to flair. Pretty soon an endless storm of finger-pointing begins to threaten to capsize the mayor's position, resulting in Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (played by John Cusack) going on a quest to find out what the slain cop was doing meeting the mobster whose bullet was responsible for the child's death. The film then develops into a fairly routine murder mystery in which the idealistic Kevin Calhoun gradually discovers the true nature of both his boss and the political world. This arc of the plot is wholly uninteresting, other than a beautiful scene in which Calhoun and Pappas square off in a tiny room and have a quiet discussion. On the surface, their conversation is about Pappas' journey from idealism to corruption, but look closer and you can see Pappas subtly manipulating Calhon, trying to influence the young Deputy Mayor into pardoning him whilst also hinting that Calhoun will one day suffer his own personal fall from grace. What's most unique about the film, though, is the way the unravelling of its central crime (the death of the six year old boy) is used to take us on an inside-the-network tour of New York City's political machinery. In other words, this is a less sophisticated, heavily truncated version of "The Wire". The difference is, where "The Wire" kept expanding and expanding until it seemed to encompass an entire neo-liberal city, "City Hall" remains focused only on the various arms of bureaucracy directly linked to mayoral politics. And like "The Wire", it attempts to look at how the political machine maintains power, how this power relates to different ethnic groups, and how the city turns otherwise well meaning human beings into budget-brained pragmatists with so many conflicting loyalties, constituencies, and priorities that the essence of compromise starts flowing naturally through their veins. In terms of style, the film was directed by Harold Becker, a journeyman director who has made several pretty good films ("Sea of Love", "Taps", "The Black Marble", "The Onion Fields", "Vision Quest"). His style is largely anonymous, which helps with this kind of material. The film has unnecessary (and jarring) narration during its opening and closing sequences, but for the most part it maintains a nice, restrained tone. 7.9/10 - "City Hall" was written by several heavyweight writers (Paul Schrader, Nicholas Pileggi, Bo Goldman and Ken Lipper, who was deputy mayor of New York under Ed Koch), all of whom help elevate this film. Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion piece to "The Contender", "Prince of the City" and "The Wire".

    Idealistic Louisiana-born John Cusack (as Kevin Calhoun) moves to New York City, where he impresses up-and-coming politician Al Pacino (as John Pappas) enough to become the Mayor's right hand man. The story begins with a shoot-out in Brooklyn, involving a gangster drug dealer and "off-duty" policeman. Unfortunately, an innocent six-year-old boy is shot dead in their crossfire. Naturally, this arouses a heightened interest in justice from the press, police, and public. Mayor Pacino tries to manage the unfolding drama with an eye on keeping his and Gotham City's reputation intact; he is considering a run for the White House, and is bidding on the upcoming Democratic Convention. Deputy Mayor Cusack joins the investigation, on his mentor's behalf. Pretty Bridget Fonda (as Marybeth Cogan) is added to up the feminine quotient, obviously; following one of the story's funerals, she and Cusack have a great car scene. Singing Rogers and Hammerstein songs, Danny Aiello (as Frank Anselmo) leads a terrific supporting cast. "City Hall" is so predictable, reviewers and studio publicity (like the DVD sleeve description) routinely hint at the film's big revelation; it was suppose to unravel slowly, but is painfully obvious too early on - in fact, the film's events, except for the opening boy's death, feel like a well-worn old pair of shoes. But, they are comfortable and fit nice. ******* City Hall (2/16/96) Harold Becker ~ John Cusack, Al Pacino, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello

    Working from a script written in part by Nicholas Pileggi, best known for writing the book Wiseguy, which he adapted into the movie Goodfellas, and for writing the book and screenplay Casino, director Harold Becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs, even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like Pappas, who is regarded as a presidential prospect. As Cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report, his skepticism is agitated. How did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence? We meet the other players in the plot, not the least of which is Danny Aiello, the political boss of Brooklyn, and Tony Franciosa, the Mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead. How and why these people are affiliated I leave to the movie to divulge, though there are never any misgivings that they are. The narrative is told generally through the eyes of the Cusack character, a visionary from Louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him. Much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations. Some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite, but considering I just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge, one can't say it doesn't work. The shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor's desk: a charge by Aiello for a subway stop and an off-ramp in Brooklyn to aid a new banking center, and the city's bid for the next Democratic convention. Individual idiosyncrasies are also explored, including Aiello's emotional bond with the music of Rogers and Hammerstein. Much also is made of menschkeit, a Yiddish expression, which, Pappas explains to his deputy, is about the bond of honor between two men, about what happens between the two hands in a handshake. This connection doesn't mean much to Bridget Fonda, the lawyer for the policeman's association who defends the dead cop's honor and fights for his widow's pension even as incriminating evidence appears. Little by little, the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law. There are various scenes of hard impact, including one where the Brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day, his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked, and then the Mafia boss drops in by surprise. There is also a compelling, and markedly conjectural, late scene between the mayor and his deputy. One scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child, in a Harlem church. His advisers tell him he won't be wanted there. But he goes anyway, and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole, Pacino and his character both. It gets an impressive reaction from the congregation, but the mayor knows, and his deputy knows, that it was artificial, and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it, in the limousine taking them away, is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo. This is a script that knows it has to supply Pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him, and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech. Pacino and Cusack are convincing together throughout the movie, the older man unbreakable and aware, the younger one anxious to learn, but with ideals that don't sway. Pacino is innate with his down-to-earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination, inspired flair and matter-of-fact realism. Cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness. The Bridget Fonda subplot development is unnecessary, but it is a result of veteran screenwriter Paul Schrader's otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character, and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments. Aiello, for instance, is a highlight because he evokes his character's joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment.

    Well, I will say this is the worst movie of Al Pacino, and this is not his mistake. I don't really know what the director was thinking while making the movie. If you have to make it a political drama, make one. But if you have to make it a murder mystery, than have it like that. I don't really know why people liked this movie so much (giving it 6 and 7 Rating, as it does not deserve it). This is simply a waste of time. People who want to watch the Political Dramas, they are well aware of the fact that the Politicians are far more intelligent than the ones shown in the story. And if they do bad things, they don't simply give up so easily. Everyone seemed to know what was happening, and no one seemed to react it. How come some one be so neglecting to incoming danger? It is natural for people having power to find the negative ways, and solve the issues, especially when they have already done something negative. It looks like they were all waiting for the climax to just pop up, and then say... 'Ah! What the..." For some reasons, the climax seemed to be obvious since the middle of the movie. 3/10 only for Al Pacino. I really liked the way he delivered his Passionate speeches. I won't say it was a completely boring movie, but many people won't enjoy it. I only did because of being Al-Pacino Frenzy.

    "Think of it as colours. There's black, and there's white, and in between is mostly grey. That's us. Now grey is a tough colour, because it's not as simple as black and white - and for the media, certainly not as interesting. But... it's what we are."  Mayor Pappas (Al Pacino) Al Pacino plays New York City mayor John Pappas, who at the height of his re-election campaign finds his office embroiled in a scandal resulting from the death of an African-American boy killed in a shoot-out between an undercover police officer and a Mafia kingpin's nephew. Pacino injects Shakespearean grandeur into his character. He is the Greek scion of the megalopolis, treating Pappas' life as a theatre show, feigning compassion and humanity when in reality he is a master of urban realpolitik. Part of the fun of the movie is observing the way Pappas operates, stroking egos, placating enemies, winking at his own manipulations. Always juggling balls (contracts, business deals etc) in the air, he's more concerned with "menschkeite" - a Yiddish phrase meaning the bonds of honour between men of power  than his City and its occupants. Of course, with the death of this six year old African-American boy, racial tensions begin to flair. Pretty soon an endless storm of finger-pointing begins to threaten to capsize the mayor's position, resulting in Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (played by John Cusack) going on a quest to find out what the slain cop was doing meeting the mobster whose bullet was responsible for the child's death. The film then develops into a fairly routine murder mystery in which the idealistic Kevin Calhoun gradually discovers the true nature of both his boss and the political world. This arc of the plot is wholly uninteresting, other than a beautiful scene in which Calhoun and Pappas square off in a tiny room and have a quiet discussion. On the surface, their conversation is about Pappas' journey from idealism to corruption, but look closer and you can see Pappas subtly manipulating Calhon, trying to influence the young Deputy Mayor into pardoning him whilst also hinting that Calhoun will one day suffer his own personal fall from grace. What's most unique about the film, though, is the way the unravelling of its central crime (the death of the six year old boy) is used to take us on an inside-the-network tour of New York City's political machinery. In other words, this is a less sophisticated, heavily truncated version of "The Wire". The difference is, where "The Wire" kept expanding and expanding until it seemed to encompass an entire neo-liberal city, "City Hall" remains focused only on the various arms of bureaucracy directly linked to mayoral politics. And like "The Wire", it attempts to look at how the political machine maintains power, how this power relates to different ethnic groups, and how the city turns otherwise well meaning human beings into budget-brained pragmatists with so many conflicting loyalties, constituencies, and priorities that the essence of compromise starts flowing naturally through their veins. In terms of style, the film was directed by Harold Becker, a journeyman director who has made several pretty good films ("Sea of Love", "Taps", "The Black Marble", "The Onion Fields", "Vision Quest"). His style is largely anonymous, which helps with this kind of material. The film has unnecessary (and jarring) narration during its opening and closing sequences, but for the most part it maintains a nice, restrained tone. 7.9/10 - "City Hall" was written by several heavyweight writers (Paul Schrader, Nicholas Pileggi, Bo Goldman and Ken Lipper, who was deputy mayor of New York under Ed Koch), all of whom help elevate this film. Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion piece to "The Contender", "Prince of the City" and "The Wire".

    Idealistic Louisiana-born John Cusack (as Kevin Calhoun) moves to New York City, where he impresses up-and-coming politician Al Pacino (as John Pappas) enough to become the Mayor's right hand man. The story begins with a shoot-out in Brooklyn, involving a gangster drug dealer and "off-duty" policeman. Unfortunately, an innocent six-year-old boy is shot dead in their crossfire. Naturally, this arouses a heightened interest in justice from the press, police, and public. Mayor Pacino tries to manage the unfolding drama with an eye on keeping his and Gotham City's reputation intact; he is considering a run for the White House, and is bidding on the upcoming Democratic Convention. Deputy Mayor Cusack joins the investigation, on his mentor's behalf. Pretty Bridget Fonda (as Marybeth Cogan) is added to up the feminine quotient, obviously; following one of the story's funerals, she and Cusack have a great car scene. Singing Rogers and Hammerstein songs, Danny Aiello (as Frank Anselmo) leads a terrific supporting cast. "City Hall" is so predictable, reviewers and studio publicity (like the DVD sleeve description) routinely hint at the film's big revelation; it was suppose to unravel slowly, but is painfully obvious too early on - in fact, the film's events, except for the opening boy's death, feel like a well-worn old pair of shoes. But, they are comfortable and fit nice. ******* City Hall (2/16/96) Harold Becker ~ John Cusack, Al Pacino, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello

    A Pileggi-Schrader Script In Which Silence Has Much More Inherent Meaning Than Speech.

    Working from a script written in part by Nicholas Pileggi, best known for writing the book Wiseguy, which he adapted into the movie Goodfellas, and for writing the book and screenplay Casino, director Harold Becker shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs, even in the command of a comparatively honorable mayor like Pappas, who is regarded as a presidential prospect. As Cusack follows the paper trail of the dead mobster's probation report, his skepticism is agitated. How did this violent young man get probation rather than a jail sentence? We meet the other players in the plot, not the least of which is Danny Aiello, the political boss of Brooklyn, and Tony Franciosa, the Mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead. How and why these people are affiliated I leave to the movie to divulge, though there are never any misgivings that they are. The narrative is told generally through the eyes of the Cusack character, a visionary from Louisiana who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him. Much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations. Some of the dialogue is ungracefully erudite, but considering I just described the building blocks of the story as bureaucratic knowledge, one can't say it doesn't work. The shooting case builds against the seasoning of two other issues on the mayor's desk: a charge by Aiello for a subway stop and an off-ramp in Brooklyn to aid a new banking center, and the city's bid for the next Democratic convention. Individual idiosyncrasies are also explored, including Aiello's emotional bond with the music of Rogers and Hammerstein. Much also is made of menschkeit, a Yiddish expression, which, Pappas explains to his deputy, is about the bond of honor between two men, about what happens between the two hands in a handshake. This connection doesn't mean much to Bridget Fonda, the lawyer for the policeman's association who defends the dead cop's honor and fights for his widow's pension even as incriminating evidence appears. Little by little, the deputy mayor comes to grasp that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it outclasses he law. There are various scenes of hard impact, including one where the Brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day, his wife asserts her interest through the medium of the dish she has cooked, and then the Mafia boss drops in by surprise. There is also a compelling, and markedly conjectural, late scene between the mayor and his deputy. One scene handled with delicacy is comprised of the mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child, in a Harlem church. His advisers tell him he won't be wanted there. But he goes anyway, and cranks himself up for a spiel of unabashed hyperbole, Pacino and his character both. It gets an impressive reaction from the congregation, but the mayor knows, and his deputy knows, that it was artificial, and the way they scrupulously evade discussing it, in the limousine taking them away, is a subtle employment of composure and innuendo. This is a script that knows it has to supply Pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him, and immediately follows its quota with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech. Pacino and Cusack are convincing together throughout the movie, the older man unbreakable and aware, the younger one anxious to learn, but with ideals that don't sway. Pacino is innate with his down-to-earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination, inspired flair and matter-of-fact realism. Cusack moves very freely in spite of his dark defensiveness. The Bridget Fonda subplot development is unnecessary, but it is a result of veteran screenwriter Paul Schrader's otherwise shrewdly perceptive belief in the worth of every character, and each is fleshed into earnest embodiments. Aiello, for instance, is a highlight because he evokes his character's joie de vivre and sensitivity to his environment.

    ***SPOILERS*** When undercover Brooklyn North Det. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano,was to meet his drug supplier Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in a buy and bust operation, with Tito being the one who gets busted, that things went haywire with both Det. Santos and Tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other. During the deadly shootout an innocent bystander six year-old James Bone Jr.,Jaliyl Lynn,was also killed in the cross-fire. With New York City slated to host the 1996 Democratic Presidential Convention that summer that last thing that the city's flamboyant Mayor Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted was a possible riot over young James Bones tragic death by a possible, in was later determined that it was a bullet from Tito's gun that killed young James, member of the New York City Police Department. What was far more shocking then even Bone's death is that his killer Tito Zapatti was given probation by the well respected NY State Judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When he should have been put behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with a kilo of cocaine in the backseat of his car! It soon became evident that the person who got Judge Stern his job, for a $50,000.00 payoff, was non other the Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It's Anselmo who's involved with Mayor Pappas in a land deal, involving the New York Subway System, that would bring him and his real estate friends tens of millions of dollars over the next two years! It would also indirectly connect Mayor Pappas in the Bone killing by connecting him to Judge Stern, who made it possible for Tito be be free, who's a mutual friend of both him and his Gomba, or Landsman, Frank Anselmo! To keep all this from blowing up the late Det. Santons is framed, by working undercover without the authority from his superiors, in the Bone shooting. In fact those framing Santos go as far and hiding some $40,000.00 in cash in his upstate summer home making it look like he was being paid off by Tito's uncle Mafia boss Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, for letting his nephew deal drugs with him getting a piece of the action. Which may well explain him, as well as Tito, getting shot by Tito welshing on his paying Santos off! As things turn out it's Mayor Pappas' deputy in City Hall Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, who ends up messing everything up for his boss by being too honest in finding who was responsible in covering up Tito's criminal record that allowed him to be out on the streets. The facts that Kevin uncovered lead straight to Frank Anselmo, a major political supporter of Mayor Pappas, who as it turned out was connected by the hip to Tito's Mafia chieftain Uncle Paul! A bit over-plotted "City Hall" does show how big city corruption can filter up, as well as down, to everyone in city government without them, like Mayor Pappas, even knowing about it. Mayor Pappas biggest sin was that he was friends with Brooklyn Boss Anselmo who was putting people into jobs, like Judge Stern, who were subjected to being blackmailed from Anselmo's real boss Mafioso Paul Zapatti. ***SPOILERS*** It only took a deadly shootout in Williamsburg to set everything into motion not by only Tito, besides Det. Santos and James Bone, being killed but why he was allowed to be out on the street in order to bring the very popular New York City Mayor down. Mayor Pappas was looking forward to much bigger things, like Governor or even President, in his future political pursuits. As it turned out his top deputy Kevin Calhoun in not looking the other way was responsible for his demise. As well as that of the Mayor's good friend Frank Anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench, as a state judge, Judge Stern. Who's decision in letting Tito Zapatti off made this whole disaster, which resulted in at least a half dozen murders and one suicide, possible!
