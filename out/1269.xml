 <sinopse>
  Director Billy Wilder salutes his idol, Ernst Lubitsch, with this comedy about a middle-aged playboy fascinated by the daughter of a private detective who has been hired to entrap him with the wife of a client.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In Paris, detective Claude Chavasse is hired to follow a wife suspected of infidelity with the notorious American libertine Frank Flannagan. When the husband learns that his suspicions are accurate, he tells Claude of his plan to kill Flannagan. Claude's daughter Ariane overhears the threat and warns Frank of the coming trouble. She then plays the part of a worldly socialite with a list of conquests as long as Flannagan's. The bemused ladies' man returns to America the next day and Ariane, completely in love, follows his romantic escapades in the news. She sees him again in Paris the following year, and resumes her worldly guise, telling tales of former lovers when they meet at his hotel in the afternoon. Frank, amazed by the mystery girl and surprised to find himself jealous of her past, hires Claude to uncover more information about her. When the detective realizes what has happened, he asks Frank not to break his daughter's heart.

    Poor Audrey Hepburn. Her waif-like persona keeps the older gentlemen interested, from William Holden and Humphrey Bogart in "Sabrina", Fred Astaire in "Funny Face", Cary Grant in "Charade" and Rex Harrison in "My Fair Lady". I guess they feel she needs a father figure. Here, her papa is Maurice Chevalier, playing against type, and very amusing doing so. He's a private detective whose client (John McGiver) discovers his wife is having an affair with an American playboy (Gary Cooper). Hepburn rushes off to warn Cooper that his lover's husband intends to shoot him and as a result falls head over heels for him. This provides the funniest sequence in the film, McGiver's seemingly drunk hubby sneering like Edward G. Robinson has he creeps through the halls of Cooper's hotel. But this is where the amusement ends. The film seems to drag for the next hour and a half as Hepburn pretends that Cooper is only one in a long line of daddy types. She is never convincing in that area, which she isn't supposed to be, and Cooper's befuddled amusement only indicates that he is actually bored. This update of Ernest Lubitsch's 1930's sex comedies provides roles for two stars of some of those films, Cooper and Chevalier. This is basically an update of the character that Cooper played in the film version of Noel Coward's "Design For Living" while Chevalier ("Love Me Tonight", "One Hour With You") takes away the rascally romantic scoundrel and plays a much more serious part. He would return to the old type of roles in his next film with "Gigi". Some people may be put off by Olga Val&eacute;ry as the hotel guest who keeps spanking her barking dog. She is meant to be comic relief, but the repetitive joke simply goes on too long. I've always been disturbed by the ending, always utilized in Hepburn tributes, which has an air of lechery to it.

    This is totally improbable. Today I suspect this movie would not even be made in the US. Cooper looks like he is approaching seventy and Hepburn appears as a teenager. Their relationship today would be considered totally inappropriate. The scene with the husband ready to shoot Cooper is an obvious weak attempt at comedy but comes across as bad farce and is so unbelievable you wonder how the director accepted that part of the script. From there it drags on and on waiting for the final match up with Cooper and Hepburn and the totally unrealistic outcome of marriage. Maurice and Audrey give rather good performances, Gary as usual acts like a wooden door.

    This movie sickened me. I've always liked Gary Cooper, but he is horribly miscast as the aging, corrupt Don Juan, Flanagan. The sight of him pawing Audrey Hepburn, who doesn't look a day over 16 is not appealing. Maurice Chevalier, who plays Audrey's father,(who I have never liked) actually does an adequate job. The movie takes place in France, but Chevalier is the only one who has a French accent. I think this movie was supposed to make us laugh. It just made me disgusted. Not recommended. 3/10

    Critics originally said this film was no good based largely on Gary Cooper's age. I concur with that assessment. I kept wondering why Audrey Hepburn's character would be attracted to an old man. But more so, why is she attracted to a man who makes his life nothing but a series of conquests? I have seen almost all of Billy Wilder's films and enjoyed them (some immensely), but this one just never felt right with me. The attraction seemed too awkward, the film ran a bit too long... I just could not see it. And for the father to support such a thing was even more astounding. If I have to say one nice thing about the movie, it is how it brings out the classic double standard of men and women with dating. The playboy travels from country to country, glorified in the newspaper for being a man of loose morals. But when he confronts a woman who has seemingly done the same, he panics.

    I agree with most of the IMDb reviewers in their appreciation for "Love in the Afternoon." It is a charming love story, made especially touching by the beautiful performance of Audrey Hepburn. A fine actress throughout her career, Hepburn's golden age was clearly the 1950s when her youthful innocence and eager, expectant face made the vulnerability of her characters seem entirely believable and very sympathetic. Having the aging Maurice Chevalier as her father in "Love in the Afternoon" was an inspired bit of casting, and the two of them seemed to fit perfectly as father and daughter. But, of the major actors of the late fifties, Gary Cooper was probably the worst possible choice to play the young Hepburn's first great love, Mr. Flannagan. It is not so much that Cooper was too old a man to be the love interest of Hepburn's character, Ariane, although Cooper certainly looked very old and tired in the movie. Because Ariane is shown to be both innocent and impressionable, one could imagine her falling in love with an older and more sophisticated gentleman. In the movie "Funny Face," Hepburn plays a character like Ariane who falls in love with the equally aged Fred Astaire, and that relationship seems quite believable. The problem with casting Cooper in "Love in the Afternoon" is that Mr. Flannagan is supposed to be a rather heartless, love-'em-and-leave-'em kind of guy, while Cooper's entire career in later life was devoted to playing honest, honorable, loyal men of strong and unshakable convictions. Perhaps the definitive Cooper role in the 1950s was the sheriff in "High Noon." To have him play an aging, indifferent rou&eacute; was an almost absurd bit of miscasting which, for me, did not seem believable for a minute. "Love in the Afternoon" is a beautiful love story Â– often touching and, thanks to the gypsies, sometimes very funny. What a shame that Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, and Fred Astaire himself were not available to play the movie's leading man.

    Gary Cooper was too old to play the jet-set playboy here. His age was really showing. Granted that the part called for an older man, but Cooper looked like he was ready to slow-down. He was not suave and debonair. He came across as a senior citizen hooked on romantic flings with the ladies around the world. Audrey Hepburn, who saves him from the clutches of John McGiver, one of Frank's (Cooper) paramours, after her father, the indomitable Maurice Chevalier, catches them in the act. As the private investigator, Chevalier is given little to do here. The picture takes a turn when Cooper begins to get a dose of his own medicine. Hepburn, now another of his ladies, tells him of the men in her life. The black and white atmosphere makes the film somewhat drab, and the constant Paris showers doesn't help much either.

    In Paris, teenage cellist Audrey Hepburn (as Ariane Chavasse) goes for grandfatherly playboy Gary Cooper (as Frank Flannagan). Detective father Maurice Chevalier (as Claude Chavasse) does not approve. This is supposed to be one of those "May/December" romances, but it looks more like "January/December". Appearing even older than his actual age, Mr. Cooper should have declared himself done with these roles. For several reasons, he has no on-screen rapport with Ms. Hepburn. Writer/director Billy Wilder had previously paired youthful Hepburn with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. The dog is poorly dubbed. *** Love in the Afternoon (5/29/57) Billy Wilder ~ Audrey Hepburn, Gary Cooper, Maurice Chevalier, John McGiver

    Most beautiful romantic comedy. It is a classic with Audrey Hepburn and Gary cooper. A middle aged playboy finally falling in love most expectedly. Some time so wonder the story reminds me of the taming the shrew but with role reversal. Hepburn plays this lovely young girl with no romantic history yet projecting the image of a femme fatal. I love the ending ... subtly set in the afternoon. Both the characters have this perfect timing, wit and humour. Distinctive style of Hepburn and cooper add this very sophistication to this love story. A powerful script. Some had argued that here was no plausible chemistry between Hepburn and cooper- however, that is where the acting ... very strong acting comes in. I feel there was chemistry, but one has to account for the huge age gap between the two characters. A must see!Great movie.

    When I saw this film in 1957 I was a young man not too happy to watch a 56 year-old geezer hitting on a girl of 20-something, My age; MY territory. All the more because Gary Cooper looks and acts much older than his 56 years, and Audrey Hepburn is playing the part of a 19 year-old. Now I'm older I know relationships between older men and girls decades younger work out just fine, as each is drawn to the other so much more than to persons their own age. There were a lot of movies in the late 1950's with older men involved with young girls simply because so many of Hollywood's top stars had aged and young ones had failed to take their place. Hepburn looks really good, with her ultra-slim figure and cute face; but a young one with a stronger personality would be better. Love in the Afternoon is simply NOT one of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's best works; but it isn't bad either. There are a few laughs and I greatly enjoyed the setting in the famous Hotel Ritz in Paris, a place I've never afforded for myself (except the restaurant and the Hemingway Bar).

    I almost got sick watching Gary Cooper trying to make love to the youthful and lovely Audrey Hepburn, like an old toad clumping around, thinking he was playing like a puppy. I would guess Ms. Hepburn was also trying to keep from retching. It gives me the creeps even to think of it. Miscasting? Worse than that. Cary Grant couldn't have brought it off, either. Any man ten years older than her would soil Audrey Heburn's wonderful sweetness and innocence, like a dishrag tossed into a souffl&eacute;. Casting certainly was a problem, but rather than replace Grant, they should have replaced Hepburn, selecting a less radiant actress, someone who looks naive perhaps but for whom there might be some plausibility in the idea of her being romantically attracted to a much older man. She might have a little desperation about her, for example, or an air of loneliness, something to explain her allowing the advances of a man so horrifically unsuitable for her. Shudder!

    This is totally improbable. Today I suspect this movie would not even be made in the US. Cooper looks like he is approaching seventy and Hepburn appears as a teenager. Their relationship today would be considered totally inappropriate. The scene with the husband ready to shoot Cooper is an obvious weak attempt at comedy but comes across as bad farce and is so unbelievable you wonder how the director accepted that part of the script. From there it drags on and on waiting for the final match up with Cooper and Hepburn and the totally unrealistic outcome of marriage. Maurice and Audrey give rather good performances, Gary as usual acts like a wooden door.

    This movie sickened me. I've always liked Gary Cooper, but he is horribly miscast as the aging, corrupt Don Juan, Flanagan. The sight of him pawing Audrey Hepburn, who doesn't look a day over 16 is not appealing. Maurice Chevalier, who plays Audrey's father,(who I have never liked) actually does an adequate job. The movie takes place in France, but Chevalier is the only one who has a French accent. I think this movie was supposed to make us laugh. It just made me disgusted. Not recommended. 3/10

    Critics originally said this film was no good based largely on Gary Cooper's age. I concur with that assessment. I kept wondering why Audrey Hepburn's character would be attracted to an old man. But more so, why is she attracted to a man who makes his life nothing but a series of conquests? I have seen almost all of Billy Wilder's films and enjoyed them (some immensely), but this one just never felt right with me. The attraction seemed too awkward, the film ran a bit too long... I just could not see it. And for the father to support such a thing was even more astounding. If I have to say one nice thing about the movie, it is how it brings out the classic double standard of men and women with dating. The playboy travels from country to country, glorified in the newspaper for being a man of loose morals. But when he confronts a woman who has seemingly done the same, he panics.

    I agree with most of the IMDb reviewers in their appreciation for "Love in the Afternoon." It is a charming love story, made especially touching by the beautiful performance of Audrey Hepburn. A fine actress throughout her career, Hepburn's golden age was clearly the 1950s when her youthful innocence and eager, expectant face made the vulnerability of her characters seem entirely believable and very sympathetic. Having the aging Maurice Chevalier as her father in "Love in the Afternoon" was an inspired bit of casting, and the two of them seemed to fit perfectly as father and daughter. But, of the major actors of the late fifties, Gary Cooper was probably the worst possible choice to play the young Hepburn's first great love, Mr. Flannagan. It is not so much that Cooper was too old a man to be the love interest of Hepburn's character, Ariane, although Cooper certainly looked very old and tired in the movie. Because Ariane is shown to be both innocent and impressionable, one could imagine her falling in love with an older and more sophisticated gentleman. In the movie "Funny Face," Hepburn plays a character like Ariane who falls in love with the equally aged Fred Astaire, and that relationship seems quite believable. The problem with casting Cooper in "Love in the Afternoon" is that Mr. Flannagan is supposed to be a rather heartless, love-'em-and-leave-'em kind of guy, while Cooper's entire career in later life was devoted to playing honest, honorable, loyal men of strong and unshakable convictions. Perhaps the definitive Cooper role in the 1950s was the sheriff in "High Noon." To have him play an aging, indifferent rou&eacute; was an almost absurd bit of miscasting which, for me, did not seem believable for a minute. "Love in the Afternoon" is a beautiful love story Â– often touching and, thanks to the gypsies, sometimes very funny. What a shame that Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, and Fred Astaire himself were not available to play the movie's leading man.

    Gary Cooper was too old to play the jet-set playboy here. His age was really showing. Granted that the part called for an older man, but Cooper looked like he was ready to slow-down. He was not suave and debonair. He came across as a senior citizen hooked on romantic flings with the ladies around the world. Audrey Hepburn, who saves him from the clutches of John McGiver, one of Frank's (Cooper) paramours, after her father, the indomitable Maurice Chevalier, catches them in the act. As the private investigator, Chevalier is given little to do here. The picture takes a turn when Cooper begins to get a dose of his own medicine. Hepburn, now another of his ladies, tells him of the men in her life. The black and white atmosphere makes the film somewhat drab, and the constant Paris showers doesn't help much either.

    In Paris, teenage cellist Audrey Hepburn (as Ariane Chavasse) goes for grandfatherly playboy Gary Cooper (as Frank Flannagan). Detective father Maurice Chevalier (as Claude Chavasse) does not approve. This is supposed to be one of those "May/December" romances, but it looks more like "January/December". Appearing even older than his actual age, Mr. Cooper should have declared himself done with these roles. For several reasons, he has no on-screen rapport with Ms. Hepburn. Writer/director Billy Wilder had previously paired youthful Hepburn with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. The dog is poorly dubbed. *** Love in the Afternoon (5/29/57) Billy Wilder ~ Audrey Hepburn, Gary Cooper, Maurice Chevalier, John McGiver

    Most beautiful romantic comedy. It is a classic with Audrey Hepburn and Gary cooper. A middle aged playboy finally falling in love most expectedly. Some time so wonder the story reminds me of the taming the shrew but with role reversal. Hepburn plays this lovely young girl with no romantic history yet projecting the image of a femme fatal. I love the ending ... subtly set in the afternoon. Both the characters have this perfect timing, wit and humour. Distinctive style of Hepburn and cooper add this very sophistication to this love story. A powerful script. Some had argued that here was no plausible chemistry between Hepburn and cooper- however, that is where the acting ... very strong acting comes in. I feel there was chemistry, but one has to account for the huge age gap between the two characters. A must see!Great movie.

    When I saw this film in 1957 I was a young man not too happy to watch a 56 year-old geezer hitting on a girl of 20-something, My age; MY territory. All the more because Gary Cooper looks and acts much older than his 56 years, and Audrey Hepburn is playing the part of a 19 year-old. Now I'm older I know relationships between older men and girls decades younger work out just fine, as each is drawn to the other so much more than to persons their own age. There were a lot of movies in the late 1950's with older men involved with young girls simply because so many of Hollywood's top stars had aged and young ones had failed to take their place. Hepburn looks really good, with her ultra-slim figure and cute face; but a young one with a stronger personality would be better. Love in the Afternoon is simply NOT one of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's best works; but it isn't bad either. There are a few laughs and I greatly enjoyed the setting in the famous Hotel Ritz in Paris, a place I've never afforded for myself (except the restaurant and the Hemingway Bar).

    I almost got sick watching Gary Cooper trying to make love to the youthful and lovely Audrey Hepburn, like an old toad clumping around, thinking he was playing like a puppy. I would guess Ms. Hepburn was also trying to keep from retching. It gives me the creeps even to think of it. Miscasting? Worse than that. Cary Grant couldn't have brought it off, either. Any man ten years older than her would soil Audrey Heburn's wonderful sweetness and innocence, like a dishrag tossed into a souffl&eacute;. Casting certainly was a problem, but rather than replace Grant, they should have replaced Hepburn, selecting a less radiant actress, someone who looks naive perhaps but for whom there might be some plausibility in the idea of her being romantically attracted to a much older man. She might have a little desperation about her, for example, or an air of loneliness, something to explain her allowing the advances of a man so horrifically unsuitable for her. Shudder!

    Poor Audrey Hepburn. Her waif-like persona keeps the older gentlemen interested, from William Holden and Humphrey Bogart in "Sabrina", Fred Astaire in "Funny Face", Cary Grant in "Charade" and Rex Harrison in "My Fair Lady". I guess they feel she needs a father figure. Here, her papa is Maurice Chevalier, playing against type, and very amusing doing so. He's a private detective whose client (John McGiver) discovers his wife is having an affair with an American playboy (Gary Cooper). Hepburn rushes off to warn Cooper that his lover's husband intends to shoot him and as a result falls head over heels for him. This provides the funniest sequence in the film, McGiver's seemingly drunk hubby sneering like Edward G. Robinson has he creeps through the halls of Cooper's hotel. But this is where the amusement ends. The film seems to drag for the next hour and a half as Hepburn pretends that Cooper is only one in a long line of daddy types. She is never convincing in that area, which she isn't supposed to be, and Cooper's befuddled amusement only indicates that he is actually bored. This update of Ernest Lubitsch's 1930's sex comedies provides roles for two stars of some of those films, Cooper and Chevalier. This is basically an update of the character that Cooper played in the film version of Noel Coward's "Design For Living" while Chevalier ("Love Me Tonight", "One Hour With You") takes away the rascally romantic scoundrel and plays a much more serious part. He would return to the old type of roles in his next film with "Gigi". Some people may be put off by Olga Val&eacute;ry as the hotel guest who keeps spanking her barking dog. She is meant to be comic relief, but the repetitive joke simply goes on too long. I've always been disturbed by the ending, always utilized in Hepburn tributes, which has an air of lechery to it.

    Gary Cooper was too old to play the jet-set playboy here. His age was really showing. Granted that the part called for an older man, but Cooper looked like he was ready to slow-down. He was not suave and debonair. He came across as a senior citizen hooked on romantic flings with the ladies around the world. Audrey Hepburn, who saves him from the clutches of John McGiver, one of Frank's (Cooper) paramours, after her father, the indomitable Maurice Chevalier, catches them in the act. As the private investigator, Chevalier is given little to do here. The picture takes a turn when Cooper begins to get a dose of his own medicine. Hepburn, now another of his ladies, tells him of the men in her life. The black and white atmosphere makes the film somewhat drab, and the constant Paris showers doesn't help much either.

    In Paris, teenage cellist Audrey Hepburn (as Ariane Chavasse) goes for grandfatherly playboy Gary Cooper (as Frank Flannagan). Detective father Maurice Chevalier (as Claude Chavasse) does not approve. This is supposed to be one of those "May/December" romances, but it looks more like "January/December". Appearing even older than his actual age, Mr. Cooper should have declared himself done with these roles. For several reasons, he has no on-screen rapport with Ms. Hepburn. Writer/director Billy Wilder had previously paired youthful Hepburn with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. The dog is poorly dubbed. *** Love in the Afternoon (5/29/57) Billy Wilder ~ Audrey Hepburn, Gary Cooper, Maurice Chevalier, John McGiver

    Most beautiful romantic comedy. It is a classic with Audrey Hepburn and Gary cooper. A middle aged playboy finally falling in love most expectedly. Some time so wonder the story reminds me of the taming the shrew but with role reversal. Hepburn plays this lovely young girl with no romantic history yet projecting the image of a femme fatal. I love the ending ... subtly set in the afternoon. Both the characters have this perfect timing, wit and humour. Distinctive style of Hepburn and cooper add this very sophistication to this love story. A powerful script. Some had argued that here was no plausible chemistry between Hepburn and cooper- however, that is where the acting ... very strong acting comes in. I feel there was chemistry, but one has to account for the huge age gap between the two characters. A must see!Great movie.

    When I saw this film in 1957 I was a young man not too happy to watch a 56 year-old geezer hitting on a girl of 20-something, My age; MY territory. All the more because Gary Cooper looks and acts much older than his 56 years, and Audrey Hepburn is playing the part of a 19 year-old. Now I'm older I know relationships between older men and girls decades younger work out just fine, as each is drawn to the other so much more than to persons their own age. There were a lot of movies in the late 1950's with older men involved with young girls simply because so many of Hollywood's top stars had aged and young ones had failed to take their place. Hepburn looks really good, with her ultra-slim figure and cute face; but a young one with a stronger personality would be better. Love in the Afternoon is simply NOT one of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's best works; but it isn't bad either. There are a few laughs and I greatly enjoyed the setting in the famous Hotel Ritz in Paris, a place I've never afforded for myself (except the restaurant and the Hemingway Bar).

    I almost got sick watching Gary Cooper trying to make love to the youthful and lovely Audrey Hepburn, like an old toad clumping around, thinking he was playing like a puppy. I would guess Ms. Hepburn was also trying to keep from retching. It gives me the creeps even to think of it. Miscasting? Worse than that. Cary Grant couldn't have brought it off, either. Any man ten years older than her would soil Audrey Heburn's wonderful sweetness and innocence, like a dishrag tossed into a souffl&eacute;. Casting certainly was a problem, but rather than replace Grant, they should have replaced Hepburn, selecting a less radiant actress, someone who looks naive perhaps but for whom there might be some plausibility in the idea of her being romantically attracted to a much older man. She might have a little desperation about her, for example, or an air of loneliness, something to explain her allowing the advances of a man so horrifically unsuitable for her. Shudder!

    Poor Audrey Hepburn. Her waif-like persona keeps the older gentlemen interested, from William Holden and Humphrey Bogart in "Sabrina", Fred Astaire in "Funny Face", Cary Grant in "Charade" and Rex Harrison in "My Fair Lady". I guess they feel she needs a father figure. Here, her papa is Maurice Chevalier, playing against type, and very amusing doing so. He's a private detective whose client (John McGiver) discovers his wife is having an affair with an American playboy (Gary Cooper). Hepburn rushes off to warn Cooper that his lover's husband intends to shoot him and as a result falls head over heels for him. This provides the funniest sequence in the film, McGiver's seemingly drunk hubby sneering like Edward G. Robinson has he creeps through the halls of Cooper's hotel. But this is where the amusement ends. The film seems to drag for the next hour and a half as Hepburn pretends that Cooper is only one in a long line of daddy types. She is never convincing in that area, which she isn't supposed to be, and Cooper's befuddled amusement only indicates that he is actually bored. This update of Ernest Lubitsch's 1930's sex comedies provides roles for two stars of some of those films, Cooper and Chevalier. This is basically an update of the character that Cooper played in the film version of Noel Coward's "Design For Living" while Chevalier ("Love Me Tonight", "One Hour With You") takes away the rascally romantic scoundrel and plays a much more serious part. He would return to the old type of roles in his next film with "Gigi". Some people may be put off by Olga Val&eacute;ry as the hotel guest who keeps spanking her barking dog. She is meant to be comic relief, but the repetitive joke simply goes on too long. I've always been disturbed by the ending, always utilized in Hepburn tributes, which has an air of lechery to it.

    This is totally improbable. Today I suspect this movie would not even be made in the US. Cooper looks like he is approaching seventy and Hepburn appears as a teenager. Their relationship today would be considered totally inappropriate. The scene with the husband ready to shoot Cooper is an obvious weak attempt at comedy but comes across as bad farce and is so unbelievable you wonder how the director accepted that part of the script. From there it drags on and on waiting for the final match up with Cooper and Hepburn and the totally unrealistic outcome of marriage. Maurice and Audrey give rather good performances, Gary as usual acts like a wooden door.

    This movie sickened me. I've always liked Gary Cooper, but he is horribly miscast as the aging, corrupt Don Juan, Flanagan. The sight of him pawing Audrey Hepburn, who doesn't look a day over 16 is not appealing. Maurice Chevalier, who plays Audrey's father,(who I have never liked) actually does an adequate job. The movie takes place in France, but Chevalier is the only one who has a French accent. I think this movie was supposed to make us laugh. It just made me disgusted. Not recommended. 3/10

    Critics originally said this film was no good based largely on Gary Cooper's age. I concur with that assessment. I kept wondering why Audrey Hepburn's character would be attracted to an old man. But more so, why is she attracted to a man who makes his life nothing but a series of conquests? I have seen almost all of Billy Wilder's films and enjoyed them (some immensely), but this one just never felt right with me. The attraction seemed too awkward, the film ran a bit too long... I just could not see it. And for the father to support such a thing was even more astounding. If I have to say one nice thing about the movie, it is how it brings out the classic double standard of men and women with dating. The playboy travels from country to country, glorified in the newspaper for being a man of loose morals. But when he confronts a woman who has seemingly done the same, he panics.

    I agree with most of the IMDb reviewers in their appreciation for "Love in the Afternoon." It is a charming love story, made especially touching by the beautiful performance of Audrey Hepburn. A fine actress throughout her career, Hepburn's golden age was clearly the 1950s when her youthful innocence and eager, expectant face made the vulnerability of her characters seem entirely believable and very sympathetic. Having the aging Maurice Chevalier as her father in "Love in the Afternoon" was an inspired bit of casting, and the two of them seemed to fit perfectly as father and daughter. But, of the major actors of the late fifties, Gary Cooper was probably the worst possible choice to play the young Hepburn's first great love, Mr. Flannagan. It is not so much that Cooper was too old a man to be the love interest of Hepburn's character, Ariane, although Cooper certainly looked very old and tired in the movie. Because Ariane is shown to be both innocent and impressionable, one could imagine her falling in love with an older and more sophisticated gentleman. In the movie "Funny Face," Hepburn plays a character like Ariane who falls in love with the equally aged Fred Astaire, and that relationship seems quite believable. The problem with casting Cooper in "Love in the Afternoon" is that Mr. Flannagan is supposed to be a rather heartless, love-'em-and-leave-'em kind of guy, while Cooper's entire career in later life was devoted to playing honest, honorable, loyal men of strong and unshakable convictions. Perhaps the definitive Cooper role in the 1950s was the sheriff in "High Noon." To have him play an aging, indifferent rou&eacute; was an almost absurd bit of miscasting which, for me, did not seem believable for a minute. "Love in the Afternoon" is a beautiful love story Â– often touching and, thanks to the gypsies, sometimes very funny. What a shame that Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, and Fred Astaire himself were not available to play the movie's leading man.

    I almost got sick watching Gary Cooper trying to make love to the youthful and lovely Audrey Hepburn, like an old toad clumping around, thinking he was playing like a puppy. I would guess Ms. Hepburn was also trying to keep from retching. It gives me the creeps even to think of it. Miscasting? Worse than that. Cary Grant couldn't have brought it off, either. Any man ten years older than her would soil Audrey Heburn's wonderful sweetness and innocence, like a dishrag tossed into a souffl&eacute;. Casting certainly was a problem, but rather than replace Grant, they should have replaced Hepburn, selecting a less radiant actress, someone who looks naive perhaps but for whom there might be some plausibility in the idea of her being romantically attracted to a much older man. She might have a little desperation about her, for example, or an air of loneliness, something to explain her allowing the advances of a man so horrifically unsuitable for her. Shudder!

    Poor Audrey Hepburn. Her waif-like persona keeps the older gentlemen interested, from William Holden and Humphrey Bogart in "Sabrina", Fred Astaire in "Funny Face", Cary Grant in "Charade" and Rex Harrison in "My Fair Lady". I guess they feel she needs a father figure. Here, her papa is Maurice Chevalier, playing against type, and very amusing doing so. He's a private detective whose client (John McGiver) discovers his wife is having an affair with an American playboy (Gary Cooper). Hepburn rushes off to warn Cooper that his lover's husband intends to shoot him and as a result falls head over heels for him. This provides the funniest sequence in the film, McGiver's seemingly drunk hubby sneering like Edward G. Robinson has he creeps through the halls of Cooper's hotel. But this is where the amusement ends. The film seems to drag for the next hour and a half as Hepburn pretends that Cooper is only one in a long line of daddy types. She is never convincing in that area, which she isn't supposed to be, and Cooper's befuddled amusement only indicates that he is actually bored. This update of Ernest Lubitsch's 1930's sex comedies provides roles for two stars of some of those films, Cooper and Chevalier. This is basically an update of the character that Cooper played in the film version of Noel Coward's "Design For Living" while Chevalier ("Love Me Tonight", "One Hour With You") takes away the rascally romantic scoundrel and plays a much more serious part. He would return to the old type of roles in his next film with "Gigi". Some people may be put off by Olga Val&eacute;ry as the hotel guest who keeps spanking her barking dog. She is meant to be comic relief, but the repetitive joke simply goes on too long. I've always been disturbed by the ending, always utilized in Hepburn tributes, which has an air of lechery to it.

    This is totally improbable. Today I suspect this movie would not even be made in the US. Cooper looks like he is approaching seventy and Hepburn appears as a teenager. Their relationship today would be considered totally inappropriate. The scene with the husband ready to shoot Cooper is an obvious weak attempt at comedy but comes across as bad farce and is so unbelievable you wonder how the director accepted that part of the script. From there it drags on and on waiting for the final match up with Cooper and Hepburn and the totally unrealistic outcome of marriage. Maurice and Audrey give rather good performances, Gary as usual acts like a wooden door.

    This movie sickened me. I've always liked Gary Cooper, but he is horribly miscast as the aging, corrupt Don Juan, Flanagan. The sight of him pawing Audrey Hepburn, who doesn't look a day over 16 is not appealing. Maurice Chevalier, who plays Audrey's father,(who I have never liked) actually does an adequate job. The movie takes place in France, but Chevalier is the only one who has a French accent. I think this movie was supposed to make us laugh. It just made me disgusted. Not recommended. 3/10

    Critics originally said this film was no good based largely on Gary Cooper's age. I concur with that assessment. I kept wondering why Audrey Hepburn's character would be attracted to an old man. But more so, why is she attracted to a man who makes his life nothing but a series of conquests? I have seen almost all of Billy Wilder's films and enjoyed them (some immensely), but this one just never felt right with me. The attraction seemed too awkward, the film ran a bit too long... I just could not see it. And for the father to support such a thing was even more astounding. If I have to say one nice thing about the movie, it is how it brings out the classic double standard of men and women with dating. The playboy travels from country to country, glorified in the newspaper for being a man of loose morals. But when he confronts a woman who has seemingly done the same, he panics.

    I agree with most of the IMDb reviewers in their appreciation for "Love in the Afternoon." It is a charming love story, made especially touching by the beautiful performance of Audrey Hepburn. A fine actress throughout her career, Hepburn's golden age was clearly the 1950s when her youthful innocence and eager, expectant face made the vulnerability of her characters seem entirely believable and very sympathetic. Having the aging Maurice Chevalier as her father in "Love in the Afternoon" was an inspired bit of casting, and the two of them seemed to fit perfectly as father and daughter. But, of the major actors of the late fifties, Gary Cooper was probably the worst possible choice to play the young Hepburn's first great love, Mr. Flannagan. It is not so much that Cooper was too old a man to be the love interest of Hepburn's character, Ariane, although Cooper certainly looked very old and tired in the movie. Because Ariane is shown to be both innocent and impressionable, one could imagine her falling in love with an older and more sophisticated gentleman. In the movie "Funny Face," Hepburn plays a character like Ariane who falls in love with the equally aged Fred Astaire, and that relationship seems quite believable. The problem with casting Cooper in "Love in the Afternoon" is that Mr. Flannagan is supposed to be a rather heartless, love-'em-and-leave-'em kind of guy, while Cooper's entire career in later life was devoted to playing honest, honorable, loyal men of strong and unshakable convictions. Perhaps the definitive Cooper role in the 1950s was the sheriff in "High Noon." To have him play an aging, indifferent rou&eacute; was an almost absurd bit of miscasting which, for me, did not seem believable for a minute. "Love in the Afternoon" is a beautiful love story Â– often touching and, thanks to the gypsies, sometimes very funny. What a shame that Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, and Fred Astaire himself were not available to play the movie's leading man.

    Gary Cooper was too old to play the jet-set playboy here. His age was really showing. Granted that the part called for an older man, but Cooper looked like he was ready to slow-down. He was not suave and debonair. He came across as a senior citizen hooked on romantic flings with the ladies around the world. Audrey Hepburn, who saves him from the clutches of John McGiver, one of Frank's (Cooper) paramours, after her father, the indomitable Maurice Chevalier, catches them in the act. As the private investigator, Chevalier is given little to do here. The picture takes a turn when Cooper begins to get a dose of his own medicine. Hepburn, now another of his ladies, tells him of the men in her life. The black and white atmosphere makes the film somewhat drab, and the constant Paris showers doesn't help much either.

    In Paris, teenage cellist Audrey Hepburn (as Ariane Chavasse) goes for grandfatherly playboy Gary Cooper (as Frank Flannagan). Detective father Maurice Chevalier (as Claude Chavasse) does not approve. This is supposed to be one of those "May/December" romances, but it looks more like "January/December". Appearing even older than his actual age, Mr. Cooper should have declared himself done with these roles. For several reasons, he has no on-screen rapport with Ms. Hepburn. Writer/director Billy Wilder had previously paired youthful Hepburn with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. The dog is poorly dubbed. *** Love in the Afternoon (5/29/57) Billy Wilder ~ Audrey Hepburn, Gary Cooper, Maurice Chevalier, John McGiver

    Most beautiful romantic comedy. It is a classic with Audrey Hepburn and Gary cooper. A middle aged playboy finally falling in love most expectedly. Some time so wonder the story reminds me of the taming the shrew but with role reversal. Hepburn plays this lovely young girl with no romantic history yet projecting the image of a femme fatal. I love the ending ... subtly set in the afternoon. Both the characters have this perfect timing, wit and humour. Distinctive style of Hepburn and cooper add this very sophistication to this love story. A powerful script. Some had argued that here was no plausible chemistry between Hepburn and cooper- however, that is where the acting ... very strong acting comes in. I feel there was chemistry, but one has to account for the huge age gap between the two characters. A must see!Great movie.

    When I saw this film in 1957 I was a young man not too happy to watch a 56 year-old geezer hitting on a girl of 20-something, My age; MY territory. All the more because Gary Cooper looks and acts much older than his 56 years, and Audrey Hepburn is playing the part of a 19 year-old. Now I'm older I know relationships between older men and girls decades younger work out just fine, as each is drawn to the other so much more than to persons their own age. There were a lot of movies in the late 1950's with older men involved with young girls simply because so many of Hollywood's top stars had aged and young ones had failed to take their place. Hepburn looks really good, with her ultra-slim figure and cute face; but a young one with a stronger personality would be better. Love in the Afternoon is simply NOT one of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's best works; but it isn't bad either. There are a few laughs and I greatly enjoyed the setting in the famous Hotel Ritz in Paris, a place I've never afforded for myself (except the restaurant and the Hemingway Bar).
