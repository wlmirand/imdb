 <sinopse>
  48 hours of intersecting lives and crimes in Los Angeles.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  John Herzfeld deftly welds together a multitude of subplots-- a loser hitman and a cool assassin involved in an insurance scam; a washed-up director, turned suicidal, if only he had someone to care for his beloved dog; a snooty art dealer, wracked by kidney stones, cared for by his devoted assistant; a grungy deranged vice cop, now partnered with a fresh-faced rookie; and two beautiful and jealous women entangled in their deadly scheme--into a spoof of the crime thriller genre.

    I was answering a question about this film, which got me thinking about it, and I decided to write a review about it. In my opinion, this film is a crime classic, and I cannot believe "2 Days In The Valley" (TDINV) is not better known. If you look at the cast you will understand why. It starts with Lee Woods (James Spader), a super cool robotic hit man, and his partner Helga Svelgen (Charlize Theron), who is an ice cold evil blonde. They are hired to kill the husband of Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher), so she can be on the US Olympic Team. They are promised $30,000 which is in the house to do so. Assisting them is hit man Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello), who turns against them, when they set him up to be the fall guy. Spoilers ahead: Helga, gets killed by Becky after a nasty cat fight (She had it coming to her). Meanwhile, Dosmo ends up meeting Susan (Glenn Headley), who is constantly abused by her snobbish boss Allen Hopper (Greg Cruttwell), and treated worse than his dog. In my favorite scene, Dosmo discovers Susan is Italian (Something in six years, Greg never learned about her because he took no interest in her as a human being), and he cooks a meal (As he is holding them hostage), and has her sit at the table with him, while he eats on the floor with his dog. Other key characters are washed screenwriter Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) who wanted to commit suicide after he found someone to take care of his dog, Nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason), and Detectives Strayer (Jeff Daniels) and Taylor (Eric Stolz).Spoilers: In the end, Lee ends up shooting Taylor, and Dosmo tries to rescue him, but cannot defeat Lee, and both will be killed, except Teddy shoots Lee dead. That action, enables him to get his confidence back and be able to start over with Audrey (Marsha Mason). One other point, about Peppers, you see in the final scene with Audrey, that he is very different than before, and will not only get a reward from the City for saving Taylor, but since he is in screenwriter, he can tell a story (leaving Dosmo & Susan out of course), that could get him a huge advance. Think about it: A Hollywood writer saves a cop, Warner Bros, Paramount, Universal and all the rest would bid on that. I would figure, that should be worth six figures to him. Dosmo and Susan end up with the $30,000 and will go to New York to open a pizza shop (Taylor lets him have it, because he was willing to take a bullet for him (Essentially the hit man turns good guy because of his conscious)). A key theme of the film is second chances for people who were essentially washed up: Dosmo, Susan, Teddy, Taylor (He would have been dead except for Dosmo & Teddy), Becky (Who gets away with it), and last, but not least, Strayer who is abusive cop, who almost shoots a black guy (Due to his temper) and wants to commit suicide, but because of thinking about his daughter does not (He gets a letter telling him to turn in his Badge, for psychological reasons, but although unhappy, at least he tolerates it, and has a chance to get his act cleaned up (Based on the theme of the film, he does). Basically a crime classic 10/10 stars.

    I've had this movie in my collection for a few years and just got around to watching it. It was given to me as a gift. I agree with other reviews that it was trying to clone Pulp Fiction, which is a much better movie. There were scenes that I really liked, although it was a little slow in connecting them. The cast was incredible. I just wish there was a little more to work with. Terintino's dialog writing skills would have made this a much better movie. Charlize Theron was incredible. I would have liked to see more of her. The version that I have is the old style snap case and it was widescreen, but not anamorphic.

    O.K. movie. I gave it a 5.If available, I probably would have given it a 5.5. Mildly entertaining. It was good to see Marcia Mason. I think if she lost weight she would still be very attractive. Glen Headly is an outstanding actress and is the only performer in the entire film bringing something new to the screen, as she always does. Loved the fight scene between Terri Hatcher and Charlize Theron. Charlize looks great in the tight jump-suit. It must have been cold on the stage the day they shot the fight scene because she was looking a little "nippley." Best phrase: As Terry Hatcher is rubbing her face into the wall she says,"Like that wall."

    "Two Days in the Valley" is an example of what has become known as "hyperlink cinema", the sort of film which involves several parallel, overlapping story lines. Films of this sort have become popular in the last few years, "Crash", "Babel" and Syriana" all being well-known examples. The introductory storyline involves two hit men, Lee Woods and Dosmo Pizzo, who kill a man named Roy Foxx while he lies in bed with his ex-wife, Becky, a former skiing champion. Woods then betrays Pizzo, shooting him and blowing up their car in order to set him up as the fall guy. Woods's plan misfires, however, and Pizzo survives, albeit injured. Gradually, more and more people become involved in the saga, starting with Woods's glamorous Norwegian girlfriend Helga and Allan Hopper, an art dealer, in whose house Pizzo seeks shelter. Others include Hopper's assistant Susan, his sister Audrey, a nurse, the two police officers to whom Becky reports the killing, and Teddy Peppers, a once-successful film producer now down on his luck and contemplating suicide. Teri Hatcher's performance as Becky earned her a nomination for Golden Raspberry Award for "Worst Supporting Actress". Whether that was fair or not is difficult to say, as I have never seen any other of the other nominated performances for that year, but this film did strengthen my general impression that Hatcher is an actress more at home on television than in the cinema. There were, however, a number of better acting contributions, notably from Danny Aiello as Pizzo, surprisingly sympathetic for a man whose occupation is killing people, Greg Cruttwell as the irascible Hopper, James Spader as the ruthless Woods, whose failure to finish off Pizzo shows that "ruthless" and "efficient" are not necessarily synonyms, and Jeff Daniels and Eric Stoltz as the two cops, Alvin Strayer and Wes Taylor. The two, who are not homicide detectives but vice cops who just happen to be in the area, have sharply contrasting characters. Alvin, the older of the two, is obsessed with driving all prostitutes out of the area, especially Asian immigrants, of whom he has a particular dislike. The young rookie Wes, by contrast, is more concerned with getting out of the vice squad and into homicide, and although Alvin berates him for his lack of knowledge of elementary police procedures it is Wes who comes up with the vital insight into the crime, namely that Becky might know more than she is telling. Charlize Theron, in her first major screen role, looks absolutely stunning as Helga. Despite its ostensibly serious subject-matter, the film never really feels like a traditional crime thriller. Although it revolves around a murder, it has more of the feel of a black comedy, not so much in the sense that it is played for laughs but rather in the sense that is played tongue in cheek. With its quirky, eccentric characters it betrays the influence of the films of Quentin Tarantino such as "Pulp Fiction". Black comedy can be something of an acquired taste, and is a difficult genre to get right, but director John Herzfeld does enough to keep the viewer's interest alive. "Two Days in the Valley" is not a great film, but it is refreshingly different enough from most run-of-the-mill Hollywood productions to make it worth watching. 6/10

    Well, I usually do not bother writing a review where so many exist; and I'm not gonna go into many details. Just allow me to say that I TOTALLY agree with those here who speak very highly of this excellent film! In every aspect where they praise some facet of this movie, they are completely right! Heh, what a way to make a review so dumb-@ss easy... Look, it's one of those clever / dark / funny films that intersects several people involved in basically the same situation. The various parts are brought together well; the acting is excellent all around, etc., etc... The ONE thing I will single out though, and I was quite surprised at this, was that along with the 'Cool' element and very dark humour, their was an amazing emotional factor too which was done quite well. Just little touches that were not necessary for the story at all, but that added a nice heartfelt dimension to what otherwise could have been the usual cool / hip / aloof crime film. DEFINITELY highly recommended and WORTHY of far, Far, bloody FAR higher rating than it has here... Bottom line (and I DO like saying 'Bottom') If you are inclined to like this genre of film at all, then it will be very entertaining and you will frigg'n LOVE it!

    Superb, quirky, comedy-crime film with a super cast. Sharply written with an edge of eccentric energy. A unique movie experience that has some very likable and loathsome misfits that feel as real as they do surreal. Some hilarious bits and gritty stuff going on here and may not appeal to all tastes, but lovers of cutting edge, experimental, although slick, productions will find some very creative turns and an artsy attempt at a combination of touching and heartfelt characters brought together by a psychopathic villain with a very sexy partner. Made just after the mega-hit Pulp Fiction, it inevitably invites comparisons. But this is not a rip- off or an homage, It stands on its own as a fresh film frolic that is as entertaining as it is original.

    I disagree with Berardinelli's review, I didn't find this film very entertaining,. To me it was more like they wanted to make an 'art film' but didn't know how to go about doing it. The movie makers cannot decide whether the film is a comedy, a thriller or something else... A pity, the cast is phenomenal but nothing transpires, other than Charlize Theron showing how stunningly beautiful she was as a young girl... Not even a great performance by Danny Aiello saves the day. I found mostly the Direction and the script to be sorely lacking. This is basically nothing else but a bunch of (decent) cameos clumsily stitched together to resemble a movie. All things considered, in my opinion this is not worth wasting your time on.

    Two hit men Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello) and Lee Woods (James Spader) are making a hit on a cheating husband Roy Foxx (Peter Horton). Before they killed him, they drugged his ex-wife Becky (Teri Hatcher), who was sleeping next to her ex-husband. While Lee double-crossed Dosmo, which Lee thought he killed him by blowing out their car. But Dosmo escaped before the car exploded, now Dosmo finds himself in a nice house with an swimming pool but Dosmo isn't alone. Since he is taking hostage of an mean-spirited art dealer (Greg Cruttwell) and his assistant (Glenne Headly). While Lee went back to his hotel with his Normegian girlfriend Helga (Oscar-Winner:Charlize Theron). Now, the both of them are waiting for their money for their last hit. While two police detectives Wes (Eric Stoltz) and Alvin (Jeff Daniels), who hates each other finds themselves on a crime scene, where Roy died. But Wes thinks, there is something not quite right about the murder. While an suicidal TV Producer Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) is trying to himself unsuccessful but in these two days in the San Frenando Valley nothing is what it seems. Written and Directed by John Herzfeld (The Death and Life of Bobby Z, 15 Minutues, Two of a Kind) made an entertaining Black Comedy that is sometimes very amusing but what makes the movie highly watchable is thanks to a sharp cast. The movie has some surprises and some good laughs. Aiello seems to be having one hell of a time in his role. While Mazursky (Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Moon over Parador, Moscow on the Hudson) steals the show in his supporting cast. Although not a box office success, "2 Days in the Valley" did manage to have an cult following. DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has Cast Bios and the Original Theatrical Trailer. "2 Days in the Valley" is a film that is hardly original but it is clever. The cast are really good and it is nicely shot in Widescreen by Oliver Wood (The Bourne Trilogy, The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Mr. Holland's Opus). There is some familiar faces in bit parts. The feature is certainly worth a look. Panavision. (****/*****).

    Several plot lines involving a multitude of characters eventually come together in this quirky comedy. The cast is awesome, with almost every character played by a familiar face. Despite such a collection of stars, however, the film never really takes off. The main problem is the uneven script that tries to balance too many plot threads and too many characters. Also, although it has its moments, the comedy is not funny enough. Herzfeld, who has mostly worked in TV, is in over his head here on both the writing and directorial fronts. In her first screen credit, Theron is an alluring bad girl and engages in a cat fight with Hatcher!

    Despite a jumbled plot and some throw away performances, "2 Days in the Valley" will keep first-time viewers involved if just for watching actors who wouldn't normally be in this kind of movie. The main problem is that writer and director John Herzfeld's career has been mainly concentrated on the small screen---and it shows. But that's not a total negative because he does have a gift for moving along a story. In "2 Days..." he certainly keeps the action and dialog flowing at a crisp rate. Unfortunately, the film tries to be both a tongue-in-cheek action film and a Black Comedy and wavers uncomfortably between the two genres. The plot revolves around a murder-for-hire to collect some life insurance money with James Spader playing the hit-man and Charlize Theron as his sexy accomplice. A naive (but beautiful) Teri Hatcher unwittingly aids and abets their plan and ends up the worst for it. Jeff Daniels steals the show as a disgruntled LA cop on the edge of losing his sanity while putting his young partner (Eric Stoltz) through the ringer. Glenne Headley and Marsha Mason, two fine and distinguished actresses, seem a bit lost in this film and neither of them have enough screen time to make a real impression. Danny Aiello and Paul Mazursky are also in the cast and both of them have worked with far better and more cohesive scripts. Louise Fletcher and Keith Carradine have all too brief cameo appearances and neither of them make much of a dent in the proceedings. Carradine is killed off so fast that he might not have collected a paycheck for his efforts. "2 Days in the Valley" will remind viewers a little bit of another film that tried to be too much; the 1985 John Landis film "Into the Night." Similar to that movie, "2 Days..." strays too far from a coherent story line and drifts off into too many directions at once. It won't ruin your evening, but it won't make it any better either.

The movie makers cannot decide whether the film is a comedy, a thriller or something else... A pity, the cast is phenomenal but nothing transpires, other than Charlize Theron showing how stunningly beautiful she was as a young girl... Not even a great performance by Danny Aiello saves the day. I found mostly the Direction and the script to be sorely lacking. This is basically nothing else but a bunch of (decent) cameos clumsily stitched together to resemble a movie. All things considered, in my opinion this is not worth wasting your time on.

    Two hit men Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello) and Lee Woods (James Spader) are making a hit on a cheating husband Roy Foxx (Peter Horton). Before they killed him, they drugged his ex-wife Becky (Teri Hatcher), who was sleeping next to her ex-husband. While Lee double-crossed Dosmo, which Lee thought he killed him by blowing out their car. But Dosmo escaped before the car exploded, now Dosmo finds himself in a nice house with an swimming pool but Dosmo isn't alone. Since he is taking hostage of an mean-spirited art dealer (Greg Cruttwell) and his assistant (Glenne Headly). While Lee went back to his hotel with his Normegian girlfriend Helga (Oscar-Winner:Charlize Theron). Now, the both of them are waiting for their money for their last hit. While two police detectives Wes (Eric Stoltz) and Alvin (Jeff Daniels), who hates each other finds themselves on a crime scene, where Roy died. But Wes thinks, there is something not quite right about the murder. While an suicidal TV Producer Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) is trying to himself unsuccessful but in these two days in the San Frenando Valley nothing is what it seems. Written and Directed by John Herzfeld (The Death and Life of Bobby Z, 15 Minutues, Two of a Kind) made an entertaining Black Comedy that is sometimes very amusing but what makes the movie highly watchable is thanks to a sharp cast. The movie has some surprises and some good laughs. Aiello seems to be having one hell of a time in his role. While Mazursky (Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Moon over Parador, Moscow on the Hudson) steals the show in his supporting cast. Although not a box office success, "2 Days in the Valley" did manage to have an cult following. DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has Cast Bios and the Original Theatrical Trailer. "2 Days in the Valley" is a film that is hardly original but it is clever. The cast are really good and it is nicely shot in Widescreen by Oliver Wood (The Bourne Trilogy, The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Mr. Holland's Opus). There is some familiar faces in bit parts. The feature is certainly worth a look. Panavision. (****/*****).

    Several plot lines involving a multitude of characters eventually come together in this quirky comedy. The cast is awesome, with almost every character played by a familiar face. Despite such a collection of stars, however, the film never really takes off. The main problem is the uneven script that tries to balance too many plot threads and too many characters. Also, although it has its moments, the comedy is not funny enough. Herzfeld, who has mostly worked in TV, is in over his head here on both the writing and directorial fronts. In her first screen credit, Theron is an alluring bad girl and engages in a cat fight with Hatcher!

    Despite a jumbled plot and some throw away performances, "2 Days in the Valley" will keep first-time viewers involved if just for watching actors who wouldn't normally be in this kind of movie. The main problem is that writer and director John Herzfeld's career has been mainly concentrated on the small screen---and it shows. But that's not a total negative because he does have a gift for moving along a story. In "2 Days..." he certainly keeps the action and dialog flowing at a crisp rate. Unfortunately, the film tries to be both a tongue-in-cheek action film and a Black Comedy and wavers uncomfortably between the two genres. The plot revolves around a murder-for-hire to collect some life insurance money with James Spader playing the hit-man and Charlize Theron as his sexy accomplice. A naive (but beautiful) Teri Hatcher unwittingly aids and abets their plan and ends up the worst for it. Jeff Daniels steals the show as a disgruntled LA cop on the edge of losing his sanity while putting his young partner (Eric Stoltz) through the ringer. Glenne Headley and Marsha Mason, two fine and distinguished actresses, seem a bit lost in this film and neither of them have enough screen time to make a real impression. Danny Aiello and Paul Mazursky are also in the cast and both of them have worked with far better and more cohesive scripts. Louise Fletcher and Keith Carradine have all too brief cameo appearances and neither of them make much of a dent in the proceedings. Carradine is killed off so fast that he might not have collected a paycheck for his efforts. "2 Days in the Valley" will remind viewers a little bit of another film that tried to be too much; the 1985 John Landis film "Into the Night." Similar to that movie, "2 Days..." strays too far from a coherent story line and drifts off into too many directions at once. It won't ruin your evening, but it won't make it any better either.

    I was answering a question about this film, which got me thinking about it, and I decided to write a review about it. In my opinion, this film is a crime classic, and I cannot believe "2 Days In The Valley" (TDINV) is not better known. If you look at the cast you will understand why. It starts with Lee Woods (James Spader), a super cool robotic hit man, and his partner Helga Svelgen (Charlize Theron), who is an ice cold evil blonde. They are hired to kill the husband of Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher), so she can be on the US Olympic Team. They are promised $30,000 which is in the house to do so. Assisting them is hit man Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello), who turns against them, when they set him up to be the fall guy. Spoilers ahead: Helga, gets killed by Becky after a nasty cat fight (She had it coming to her). Meanwhile, Dosmo ends up meeting Susan (Glenn Headley), who is constantly abused by her snobbish boss Allen Hopper (Greg Cruttwell), and treated worse than his dog. In my favorite scene, Dosmo discovers Susan is Italian (Something in six years, Greg never learned about her because he took no interest in her as a human being), and he cooks a meal (As he is holding them hostage), and has her sit at the table with him, while he eats on the floor with his dog. Other key characters are washed screenwriter Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) who wanted to commit suicide after he found someone to take care of his dog, Nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason), and Detectives Strayer (Jeff Daniels) and Taylor (Eric Stolz).Spoilers: In the end, Lee ends up shooting Taylor, and Dosmo tries to rescue him, but cannot defeat Lee, and both will be killed, except Teddy shoots Lee dead. That action, enables him to get his confidence back and be able to start over with Audrey (Marsha Mason). One other point, about Peppers, you see in the final scene with Audrey, that he is very different than before, and will not only get a reward from the City for saving Taylor, but since he is in screenwriter, he can tell a story (leaving Dosmo & Susan out of course), that could get him a huge advance. Think about it: A Hollywood writer saves a cop, Warner Bros, Paramount, Universal and all the rest would bid on that. I would figure, that should be worth six figures to him. Dosmo and Susan end up with the $30,000 and will go to New York to open a pizza shop (Taylor lets him have it, because he was willing to take a bullet for him (Essentially the hit man turns good guy because of his conscious)). A key theme of the film is second chances for people who were essentially washed up: Dosmo, Susan, Teddy, Taylor (He would have been dead except for Dosmo & Teddy), Becky (Who gets away with it), and last, but not least, Strayer who is abusive cop, who almost shoots a black guy (Due to his temper) and wants to commit suicide, but because of thinking about his daughter does not (He gets a letter telling him to turn in his Badge, for psychological reasons, but although unhappy, at least he tolerates it, and has a chance to get his act cleaned up (Based on the theme of the film, he does). Basically a crime classic 10/10 stars.

    I've had this movie in my collection for a few years and just got around to watching it. It was given to me as a gift. I agree with other reviews that it was trying to clone Pulp Fiction, which is a much better movie. There were scenes that I really liked, although it was a little slow in connecting them. The cast was incredible. I just wish there was a little more to work with. Terintino's dialog writing skills would have made this a much better movie. Charlize Theron was incredible. I would have liked to see more of her. The version that I have is the old style snap case and it was widescreen, but not anamorphic.

    O.K. movie. I gave it a 5.If available, I probably would have given it a 5.5. Mildly entertaining. It was good to see Marcia Mason. I think if she lost weight she would still be very attractive. Glen Headly is an outstanding actress and is the only performer in the entire film bringing something new to the screen, as she always does. Loved the fight scene between Terri Hatcher and Charlize Theron. Charlize looks great in the tight jump-suit. It must have been cold on the stage the day they shot the fight scene because she was looking a little "nippley." Best phrase: As Terry Hatcher is rubbing her face into the wall she says,"Like that wall."

    "Two Days in the Valley" is an example of what has become known as "hyperlink cinema", the sort of film which involves several parallel, overlapping story lines. Films of this sort have become popular in the last few years, "Crash", "Babel" and Syriana" all being well-known examples. The introductory storyline involves two hit men, Lee Woods and Dosmo Pizzo, who kill a man named Roy Foxx while he lies in bed with his ex-wife, Becky, a former skiing champion. Woods then betrays Pizzo, shooting him and blowing up their car in order to set him up as the fall guy. Woods's plan misfires, however, and Pizzo survives, albeit injured. Gradually, more and more people become involved in the saga, starting with Woods's glamorous Norwegian girlfriend Helga and Allan Hopper, an art dealer, in whose house Pizzo seeks shelter. Others include Hopper's assistant Susan, his sister Audrey, a nurse, the two police officers to whom Becky reports the killing, and Teddy Peppers, a once-successful film producer now down on his luck and contemplating suicide. Teri Hatcher's performance as Becky earned her a nomination for Golden Raspberry Award for "Worst Supporting Actress". Whether that was fair or not is difficult to say, as I have never seen any other of the other nominated performances for that year, but this film did strengthen my general impression that Hatcher is an actress more at home on television than in the cinema. There were, however, a number of better acting contributions, notably from Danny Aiello as Pizzo, surprisingly sympathetic for a man whose occupation is killing people, Greg Cruttwell as the irascible Hopper, James Spader as the ruthless Woods, whose failure to finish off Pizzo shows that "ruthless" and "efficient" are not necessarily synonyms, and Jeff Daniels and Eric Stoltz as the two cops, Alvin Strayer and Wes Taylor. The two, who are not homicide detectives but vice cops who just happen to be in the area, have sharply contrasting characters. Alvin, the older of the two, is obsessed with driving all prostitutes out of the area, especially Asian immigrants, of whom he has a particular dislike. The young rookie Wes, by contrast, is more concerned with getting out of the vice squad and into homicide, and although Alvin berates him for his lack of knowledge of elementary police procedures it is Wes who comes up with the vital insight into the crime, namely that Becky might know more than she is telling. Charlize Theron, in her first major screen role, looks absolutely stunning as Helga. Despite its ostensibly serious subject-matter, the film never really feels like a traditional crime thriller. Although it revolves around a murder, it has more of the feel of a black comedy, not so much in the sense that it is played for laughs but rather in the sense that is played tongue in cheek. With its quirky, eccentric characters it betrays the influence of the films of Quentin Tarantino such as "Pulp Fiction". Black comedy can be something of an acquired taste, and is a difficult genre to get right, but director John Herzfeld does enough to keep the viewer's interest alive. "Two Days in the Valley" is not a great film, but it is refreshingly different enough from most run-of-the-mill Hollywood productions to make it worth watching. 6/10

    Well, I usually do not bother writing a review where so many exist; and I'm not gonna go into many details. Just allow me to say that I TOTALLY agree with those here who speak very highly of this excellent film! In every aspect where they praise some facet of this movie, they are completely right! Heh, what a way to make a review so dumb-@ss easy... Look, it's one of those clever / dark / funny films that intersects several people involved in basically the same situation. The various parts are brought together well; the acting is excellent all around, etc., etc... The ONE thing I will single out though, and I was quite surprised at this, was that along with the 'Cool' element and very dark humour, their was an amazing emotional factor too which was done quite well. Just little touches that were not necessary for the story at all, but that added a nice heartfelt dimension to what otherwise could have been the usual cool / hip / aloof crime film. DEFINITELY highly recommended and WORTHY of far, Far, bloody FAR higher rating than it has here... Bottom line (and I DO like saying 'Bottom') If you are inclined to like this genre of film at all, then it will be very entertaining and you will frigg'n LOVE it!

    Superb, quirky, comedy-crime film with a super cast. Sharply written with an edge of eccentric energy. A unique movie experience that has some very likable and loathsome misfits that feel as real as they do surreal. Some hilarious bits and gritty stuff going on here and may not appeal to all tastes, but lovers of cutting edge, experimental, although slick, productions will find some very creative turns and an artsy attempt at a combination of touching and heartfelt characters brought together by a psychopathic villain with a very sexy partner. Made just after the mega-hit Pulp Fiction, it inevitably invites comparisons. But this is not a rip- off or an homage, It stands on its own as a fresh film frolic that is as entertaining as it is original.

The two, who are not homicide detectives but vice cops who just happen to be in the area, have sharply contrasting characters. Alvin, the older of the two, is obsessed with driving all prostitutes out of the area, especially Asian immigrants, of whom he has a particular dislike. The young rookie Wes, by contrast, is more concerned with getting out of the vice squad and into homicide, and although Alvin berates him for his lack of knowledge of elementary police procedures it is Wes who comes up with the vital insight into the crime, namely that Becky might know more than she is telling. Charlize Theron, in her first major screen role, looks absolutely stunning as Helga. Despite its ostensibly serious subject-matter, the film never really feels like a traditional crime thriller. Although it revolves around a murder, it has more of the feel of a black comedy, not so much in the sense that it is played for laughs but rather in the sense that is played tongue in cheek. With its quirky, eccentric characters it betrays the influence of the films of Quentin Tarantino such as "Pulp Fiction". Black comedy can be something of an acquired taste, and is a difficult genre to get right, but director John Herzfeld does enough to keep the viewer's interest alive. "Two Days in the Valley" is not a great film, but it is refreshingly different enough from most run-of-the-mill Hollywood productions to make it worth watching. 6/10

    Well, I usually do not bother writing a review where so many exist; and I'm not gonna go into many details. Just allow me to say that I TOTALLY agree with those here who speak very highly of this excellent film! In every aspect where they praise some facet of this movie, they are completely right! Heh, what a way to make a review so dumb-@ss easy... Look, it's one of those clever / dark / funny films that intersects several people involved in basically the same situation. The various parts are brought together well; the acting is excellent all around, etc., etc... The ONE thing I will single out though, and I was quite surprised at this, was that along with the 'Cool' element and very dark humour, their was an amazing emotional factor too which was done quite well. Just little touches that were not necessary for the story at all, but that added a nice heartfelt dimension to what otherwise could have been the usual cool / hip / aloof crime film. DEFINITELY highly recommended and WORTHY of far, Far, bloody FAR higher rating than it has here... Bottom line (and I DO like saying 'Bottom') If you are inclined to like this genre of film at all, then it will be very entertaining and you will frigg'n LOVE it!

    Superb, quirky, comedy-crime film with a super cast. Sharply written with an edge of eccentric energy. A unique movie experience that has some very likable and loathsome misfits that feel as real as they do surreal. Some hilarious bits and gritty stuff going on here and may not appeal to all tastes, but lovers of cutting edge, experimental, although slick, productions will find some very creative turns and an artsy attempt at a combination of touching and heartfelt characters brought together by a psychopathic villain with a very sexy partner. Made just after the mega-hit Pulp Fiction, it inevitably invites comparisons. But this is not a rip- off or an homage, It stands on its own as a fresh film frolic that is as entertaining as it is original.

    I disagree with Berardinelli's review, I didn't find this film very entertaining,. To me it was more like they wanted to make an 'art film' but didn't know how to go about doing it. The movie makers cannot decide whether the film is a comedy, a thriller or something else... A pity, the cast is phenomenal but nothing transpires, other than Charlize Theron showing how stunningly beautiful she was as a young girl... Not even a great performance by Danny Aiello saves the day. I found mostly the Direction and the script to be sorely lacking. This is basically nothing else but a bunch of (decent) cameos clumsily stitched together to resemble a movie. All things considered, in my opinion this is not worth wasting your time on.

    Two hit men Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello) and Lee Woods (James Spader) are making a hit on a cheating husband Roy Foxx (Peter Horton). Before they killed him, they drugged his ex-wife Becky (Teri Hatcher), who was sleeping next to her ex-husband. While Lee double-crossed Dosmo, which Lee thought he killed him by blowing out their car. But Dosmo escaped before the car exploded, now Dosmo finds himself in a nice house with an swimming pool but Dosmo isn't alone. Since he is taking hostage of an mean-spirited art dealer (Greg Cruttwell) and his assistant (Glenne Headly). While Lee went back to his hotel with his Normegian girlfriend Helga (Oscar-Winner:Charlize Theron). Now, the both of them are waiting for their money for their last hit. While two police detectives Wes (Eric Stoltz) and Alvin (Jeff Daniels), who hates each other finds themselves on a crime scene, where Roy died. But Wes thinks, there is something not quite right about the murder. While an suicidal TV Producer Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) is trying to himself unsuccessful but in these two days in the San Frenando Valley nothing is what it seems. Written and Directed by John Herzfeld (The Death and Life of Bobby Z, 15 Minutues, Two of a Kind) made an entertaining Black Comedy that is sometimes very amusing but what makes the movie highly watchable is thanks to a sharp cast. The movie has some surprises and some good laughs. Aiello seems to be having one hell of a time in his role. While Mazursky (Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Moon over Parador, Moscow on the Hudson) steals the show in his supporting cast. Although not a box office success, "2 Days in the Valley" did manage to have an cult following. DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has Cast Bios and the Original Theatrical Trailer. "2 Days in the Valley" is a film that is hardly original but it is clever. The cast are really good and it is nicely shot in Widescreen by Oliver Wood (The Bourne Trilogy, The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Mr. Holland's Opus). There is some familiar faces in bit parts. The feature is certainly worth a look. Panavision. (****/*****).

    Several plot lines involving a multitude of characters eventually come together in this quirky comedy. The cast is awesome, with almost every character played by a familiar face. Despite such a collection of stars, however, the film never really takes off. The main problem is the uneven script that tries to balance too many plot threads and too many characters. Also, although it has its moments, the comedy is not funny enough. Herzfeld, who has mostly worked in TV, is in over his head here on both the writing and directorial fronts. In her first screen credit, Theron is an alluring bad girl and engages in a cat fight with Hatcher!

    Despite a jumbled plot and some throw away performances, "2 Days in the Valley" will keep first-time viewers involved if just for watching actors who wouldn't normally be in this kind of movie. The main problem is that writer and director John Herzfeld's career has been mainly concentrated on the small screen---and it shows. But that's not a total negative because he does have a gift for moving along a story. In "2 Days..." he certainly keeps the action and dialog flowing at a crisp rate. Unfortunately, the film tries to be both a tongue-in-cheek action film and a Black Comedy and wavers uncomfortably between the two genres. The plot revolves around a murder-for-hire to collect some life insurance money with James Spader playing the hit-man and Charlize Theron as his sexy accomplice. A naive (but beautiful) Teri Hatcher unwittingly aids and abets their plan and ends up the worst for it. Jeff Daniels steals the show as a disgruntled LA cop on the edge of losing his sanity while putting his young partner (Eric Stoltz) through the ringer. Glenne Headley and Marsha Mason, two fine and distinguished actresses, seem a bit lost in this film and neither of them have enough screen time to make a real impression. Danny Aiello and Paul Mazursky are also in the cast and both of them have worked with far better and more cohesive scripts. Louise Fletcher and Keith Carradine have all too brief cameo appearances and neither of them make much of a dent in the proceedings. Carradine is killed off so fast that he might not have collected a paycheck for his efforts. "2 Days in the Valley" will remind viewers a little bit of another film that tried to be too much; the 1985 John Landis film "Into the Night." Similar to that movie, "2 Days..." strays too far from a coherent story line and drifts off into too many directions at once. It won't ruin your evening, but it won't make it any better either.

    I was answering a question about this film, which got me thinking about it, and I decided to write a review about it. In my opinion, this film is a crime classic, and I cannot believe "2 Days In The Valley" (TDINV) is not better known. If you look at the cast you will understand why. It starts with Lee Woods (James Spader), a super cool robotic hit man, and his partner Helga Svelgen (Charlize Theron), who is an ice cold evil blonde. They are hired to kill the husband of Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher), so she can be on the US Olympic Team. They are promised $30,000 which is in the house to do so. Assisting them is hit man Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello), who turns against them, when they set him up to be the fall guy. Spoilers ahead: Helga, gets killed by Becky after a nasty cat fight (She had it coming to her). Meanwhile, Dosmo ends up meeting Susan (Glenn Headley), who is constantly abused by her snobbish boss Allen Hopper (Greg Cruttwell), and treated worse than his dog. In my favorite scene, Dosmo discovers Susan is Italian (Something in six years, Greg never learned about her because he took no interest in her as a human being), and he cooks a meal (As he is holding them hostage), and has her sit at the table with him, while he eats on the floor with his dog. Other key characters are washed screenwriter Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) who wanted to commit suicide after he found someone to take care of his dog, Nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason), and Detectives Strayer (Jeff Daniels) and Taylor (Eric Stolz).Spoilers: In the end, Lee ends up shooting Taylor, and Dosmo tries to rescue him, but cannot defeat Lee, and both will be killed, except Teddy shoots Lee dead. That action, enables him to get his confidence back and be able to start over with Audrey (Marsha Mason). One other point, about Peppers, you see in the final scene with Audrey, that he is very different than before, and will not only get a reward from the City for saving Taylor, but since he is in screenwriter, he can tell a story (leaving Dosmo & Susan out of course), that could get him a huge advance. Think about it: A Hollywood writer saves a cop, Warner Bros, Paramount, Universal and all the rest would bid on that. I would figure, that should be worth six figures to him. Dosmo and Susan end up with the $30,000 and will go to New York to open a pizza shop (Taylor lets him have it, because he was willing to take a bullet for him (Essentially the hit man turns good guy because of his conscious)). A key theme of the film is second chances for people who were essentially washed up: Dosmo, Susan, Teddy, Taylor (He would have been dead except for Dosmo & Teddy), Becky (Who gets away with it), and last, but not least, Strayer who is abusive cop, who almost shoots a black guy (Due to his temper) and wants to commit suicide, but because of thinking about his daughter does not (He gets a letter telling him to turn in his Badge, for psychological reasons, but although unhappy, at least he tolerates it, and has a chance to get his act cleaned up (Based on the theme of the film, he does). Basically a crime classic 10/10 stars.

    I've had this movie in my collection for a few years and just got around to watching it. It was given to me as a gift. I agree with other reviews that it was trying to clone Pulp Fiction, which is a much better movie. There were scenes that I really liked, although it was a little slow in connecting them. The cast was incredible. I just wish there was a little more to work with. Terintino's dialog writing skills would have made this a much better movie. Charlize Theron was incredible. I would have liked to see more of her. The version that I have is the old style snap case and it was widescreen, but not anamorphic.

    O.K. movie. I gave it a 5.If available, I probably would have given it a 5.5. Mildly entertaining. It was good to see Marcia Mason. I think if she lost weight she would still be very attractive. Glen Headly is an outstanding actress and is the only performer in the entire film bringing something new to the screen, as she always does. Loved the fight scene between Terri Hatcher and Charlize Theron. Charlize looks great in the tight jump-suit. It must have been cold on the stage the day they shot the fight scene because she was looking a little "nippley." Best phrase: As Terry Hatcher is rubbing her face into the wall she says,"Like that wall."

    "Two Days in the Valley" is an example of what has become known as "hyperlink cinema", the sort of film which involves several parallel, overlapping story lines. Films of this sort have become popular in the last few years, "Crash", "Babel" and Syriana" all being well-known examples. The introductory storyline involves two hit men, Lee Woods and Dosmo Pizzo, who kill a man named Roy Foxx while he lies in bed with his ex-wife, Becky, a former skiing champion. Woods then betrays Pizzo, shooting him and blowing up their car in order to set him up as the fall guy. Woods's plan misfires, however, and Pizzo survives, albeit injured. Gradually, more and more people become involved in the saga, starting with Woods's glamorous Norwegian girlfriend Helga and Allan Hopper, an art dealer, in whose house Pizzo seeks shelter. Others include Hopper's assistant Susan, his sister Audrey, a nurse, the two police officers to whom Becky reports the killing, and Teddy Peppers, a once-successful film producer now down on his luck and contemplating suicide. Teri Hatcher's performance as Becky earned her a nomination for Golden Raspberry Award for "Worst Supporting Actress". Whether that was fair or not is difficult to say, as I have never seen any other of the other nominated performances for that year, but this film did strengthen my general impression that Hatcher is an actress more at home on television than in the cinema. There were, however, a number of better acting contributions, notably from Danny Aiello as Pizzo, surprisingly sympathetic for a man whose occupation is killing people, Greg Cruttwell as the irascible Hopper, James Spader as the ruthless Woods, whose failure to finish off Pizzo shows that "ruthless" and "efficient" are not necessarily synonyms, and Jeff Daniels and Eric Stoltz as the two cops, Alvin Strayer and Wes Taylor. The two, who are not homicide detectives but vice cops who just happen to be in the area, have sharply contrasting characters. Alvin, the older of the two, is obsessed with driving all prostitutes out of the area, especially Asian immigrants, of whom he has a particular dislike. The young rookie Wes, by contrast, is more concerned with getting out of the vice squad and into homicide, and although Alvin berates him for his lack of knowledge of elementary police procedures it is Wes who comes up with the vital insight into the crime, namely that Becky might know more than she is telling. Charlize Theron, in her first major screen role, looks absolutely stunning as Helga. Despite its ostensibly serious subject-matter, the film never really feels like a traditional crime thriller.

"Two Days in the Valley" is not a great film, but it is refreshingly different enough from most run-of-the-mill Hollywood productions to make it worth watching. 6/10

Dosmo and Susan end up with the $30,000 and will go to New York to open a pizza shop (Taylor lets him have it, because he was willing to take a bullet for him (Essentially the hit man turns good guy because of his conscious)). A key theme of the film is second chances for people who were essentially washed up: Dosmo, Susan, Teddy, Taylor (He would have been dead except for Dosmo & Teddy), Becky (Who gets away with it), and last, but not least, Strayer who is abusive cop, who almost shoots a black guy (Due to his temper) and wants to commit suicide, but because of thinking about his daughter does not (He gets a letter telling him to turn in his Badge, for psychological reasons, but although unhappy, at least he tolerates it, and has a chance to get his act cleaned up (Based on the theme of the film, he does). Basically a crime classic 10/10 stars.

    I've had this movie in my collection for a few years and just got around to watching it. It was given to me as a gift. I agree with other reviews that it was trying to clone Pulp Fiction, which is a much better movie. There were scenes that I really liked, although it was a little slow in connecting them. The cast was incredible. I just wish there was a little more to work with. Terintino's dialog writing skills would have made this a much better movie. Charlize Theron was incredible. I would have liked to see more of her. The version that I have is the old style snap case and it was widescreen, but not anamorphic.

    O.K. movie. I gave it a 5.If available, I probably would have given it a 5.5. Mildly entertaining. It was good to see Marcia Mason. I think if she lost weight she would still be very attractive. Glen Headly is an outstanding actress and is the only performer in the entire film bringing something new to the screen, as she always does. Loved the fight scene between Terri Hatcher and Charlize Theron. Charlize looks great in the tight jump-suit. It must have been cold on the stage the day they shot the fight scene because she was looking a little "nippley." Best phrase: As Terry Hatcher is rubbing her face into the wall she says,"Like that wall."

    "Two Days in the Valley" is an example of what has become known as "hyperlink cinema", the sort of film which involves several parallel, overlapping story lines. Films of this sort have become popular in the last few years, "Crash", "Babel" and Syriana" all being well-known examples. The introductory storyline involves two hit men, Lee Woods and Dosmo Pizzo, who kill a man named Roy Foxx while he lies in bed with his ex-wife, Becky, a former skiing champion. Woods then betrays Pizzo, shooting him and blowing up their car in order to set him up as the fall guy. Woods's plan misfires, however, and Pizzo survives, albeit injured. Gradually, more and more people become involved in the saga, starting with Woods's glamorous Norwegian girlfriend Helga and Allan Hopper, an art dealer, in whose house Pizzo seeks shelter. Others include Hopper's assistant Susan, his sister Audrey, a nurse, the two police officers to whom Becky reports the killing, and Teddy Peppers, a once-successful film producer now down on his luck and contemplating suicide. Teri Hatcher's performance as Becky earned her a nomination for Golden Raspberry Award for "Worst Supporting Actress". Whether that was fair or not is difficult to say, as I have never seen any other of the other nominated performances for that year, but this film did strengthen my general impression that Hatcher is an actress more at home on television than in the cinema. There were, however, a number of better acting contributions, notably from Danny Aiello as Pizzo, surprisingly sympathetic for a man whose occupation is killing people, Greg Cruttwell as the irascible Hopper, James Spader as the ruthless Woods, whose failure to finish off Pizzo shows that "ruthless" and "efficient" are not necessarily synonyms, and Jeff Daniels and Eric Stoltz as the two cops, Alvin Strayer and Wes Taylor. The two, who are not homicide detectives but vice cops who just happen to be in the area, have sharply contrasting characters. Alvin, the older of the two, is obsessed with driving all prostitutes out of the area, especially Asian immigrants, of whom he has a particular dislike. The young rookie Wes, by contrast, is more concerned with getting out of the vice squad and into homicide, and although Alvin berates him for his lack of knowledge of elementary police procedures it is Wes who comes up with the vital insight into the crime, namely that Becky might know more than she is telling. Charlize Theron, in her first major screen role, looks absolutely stunning as Helga. Despite its ostensibly serious subject-matter, the film never really feels like a traditional crime thriller. Although it revolves around a murder, it has more of the feel of a black comedy, not so much in the sense that it is played for laughs but rather in the sense that is played tongue in cheek. With its quirky, eccentric characters it betrays the influence of the films of Quentin Tarantino such as "Pulp Fiction". Black comedy can be something of an acquired taste, and is a difficult genre to get right, but director John Herzfeld does enough to keep the viewer's interest alive. "Two Days in the Valley" is not a great film, but it is refreshingly different enough from most run-of-the-mill Hollywood productions to make it worth watching. 6/10

    Well, I usually do not bother writing a review where so many exist; and I'm not gonna go into many details. Just allow me to say that I TOTALLY agree with those here who speak very highly of this excellent film! In every aspect where they praise some facet of this movie, they are completely right! Heh, what a way to make a review so dumb-@ss easy... Look, it's one of those clever / dark / funny films that intersects several people involved in basically the same situation. The various parts are brought together well; the acting is excellent all around, etc., etc... The ONE thing I will single out though, and I was quite surprised at this, was that along with the 'Cool' element and very dark humour, their was an amazing emotional factor too which was done quite well. Just little touches that were not necessary for the story at all, but that added a nice heartfelt dimension to what otherwise could have been the usual cool / hip / aloof crime film. DEFINITELY highly recommended and WORTHY of far, Far, bloody FAR higher rating than it has here... Bottom line (and I DO like saying 'Bottom') If you are inclined to like this genre of film at all, then it will be very entertaining and you will frigg'n LOVE it!

    Superb, quirky, comedy-crime film with a super cast. Sharply written with an edge of eccentric energy. A unique movie experience that has some very likable and loathsome misfits that feel as real as they do surreal. Some hilarious bits and gritty stuff going on here and may not appeal to all tastes, but lovers of cutting edge, experimental, although slick, productions will find some very creative turns and an artsy attempt at a combination of touching and heartfelt characters brought together by a psychopathic villain with a very sexy partner. Made just after the mega-hit Pulp Fiction, it inevitably invites comparisons. But this is not a rip- off or an homage, It stands on its own as a fresh film frolic that is as entertaining as it is original.

    I disagree with Berardinelli's review, I didn't find this film very entertaining,. To me it was more like they wanted to make an 'art film' but didn't know how to go about doing it. The movie makers cannot decide whether the film is a comedy, a thriller or something else... A pity, the cast is phenomenal but nothing transpires, other than Charlize Theron showing how stunningly beautiful she was as a young girl... Not even a great performance by Danny Aiello saves the day. I found mostly the Direction and the script to be sorely lacking. This is basically nothing else but a bunch of (decent) cameos clumsily stitched together to resemble a movie. All things considered, in my opinion this is not worth wasting your time on.

    Two hit men Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello) and Lee Woods (James Spader) are making a hit on a cheating husband Roy Foxx (Peter Horton). Before they killed him, they drugged his ex-wife Becky (Teri Hatcher), who was sleeping next to her ex-husband. While Lee double-crossed Dosmo, which Lee thought he killed him by blowing out their car. But Dosmo escaped before the car exploded, now Dosmo finds himself in a nice house with an swimming pool but Dosmo isn't alone. Since he is taking hostage of an mean-spirited art dealer (Greg Cruttwell) and his assistant (Glenne Headly). While Lee went back to his hotel with his Normegian girlfriend Helga (Oscar-Winner:Charlize Theron). Now, the both of them are waiting for their money for their last hit. While two police detectives Wes (Eric Stoltz) and Alvin (Jeff Daniels), who hates each other finds themselves on a crime scene, where Roy died. But Wes thinks, there is something not quite right about the murder. While an suicidal TV Producer Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) is trying to himself unsuccessful but in these two days in the San Frenando Valley nothing is what it seems. Written and Directed by John Herzfeld (The Death and Life of Bobby Z, 15 Minutues, Two of a Kind) made an entertaining Black Comedy that is sometimes very amusing but what makes the movie highly watchable is thanks to a sharp cast. The movie has some surprises and some good laughs. Aiello seems to be having one hell of a time in his role. While Mazursky (Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Moon over Parador, Moscow on the Hudson) steals the show in his supporting cast. Although not a box office success, "2 Days in the Valley" did manage to have an cult following. DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has Cast Bios and the Original Theatrical Trailer. "2 Days in the Valley" is a film that is hardly original but it is clever. The cast are really good and it is nicely shot in Widescreen by Oliver Wood (The Bourne Trilogy, The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Mr. Holland's Opus). There is some familiar faces in bit parts. The feature is certainly worth a look. Panavision. (****/*****).

    Several plot lines involving a multitude of characters eventually come together in this quirky comedy. The cast is awesome, with almost every character played by a familiar face. Despite such a collection of stars, however, the film never really takes off. The main problem is the uneven script that tries to balance too many plot threads and too many characters. Also, although it has its moments, the comedy is not funny enough. Herzfeld, who has mostly worked in TV, is in over his head here on both the writing and directorial fronts. In her first screen credit, Theron is an alluring bad girl and engages in a cat fight with Hatcher!

    Despite a jumbled plot and some throw away performances, "2 Days in the Valley" will keep first-time viewers involved if just for watching actors who wouldn't normally be in this kind of movie. The main problem is that writer and director John Herzfeld's career has been mainly concentrated on the small screen---and it shows. But that's not a total negative because he does have a gift for moving along a story. In "2 Days..." he certainly keeps the action and dialog flowing at a crisp rate. Unfortunately, the film tries to be both a tongue-in-cheek action film and a Black Comedy and wavers uncomfortably between the two genres. The plot revolves around a murder-for-hire to collect some life insurance money with James Spader playing the hit-man and Charlize Theron as his sexy accomplice. A naive (but beautiful) Teri Hatcher unwittingly aids and abets their plan and ends up the worst for it. Jeff Daniels steals the show as a disgruntled LA cop on the edge of losing his sanity while putting his young partner (Eric Stoltz) through the ringer. Glenne Headley and Marsha Mason, two fine and distinguished actresses, seem a bit lost in this film and neither of them have enough screen time to make a real impression. Danny Aiello and Paul Mazursky are also in the cast and both of them have worked with far better and more cohesive scripts. Louise Fletcher and Keith Carradine have all too brief cameo appearances and neither of them make much of a dent in the proceedings. Carradine is killed off so fast that he might not have collected a paycheck for his efforts. "2 Days in the Valley" will remind viewers a little bit of another film that tried to be too much; the 1985 John Landis film "Into the Night." Similar to that movie, "2 Days..." strays too far from a coherent story line and drifts off into too many directions at once. It won't ruin your evening, but it won't make it any better either.

    I was answering a question about this film, which got me thinking about it, and I decided to write a review about it. In my opinion, this film is a crime classic, and I cannot believe "2 Days In The Valley" (TDINV) is not better known. If you look at the cast you will understand why. It starts with Lee Woods (James Spader), a super cool robotic hit man, and his partner Helga Svelgen (Charlize Theron), who is an ice cold evil blonde. They are hired to kill the husband of Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher), so she can be on the US Olympic Team. They are promised $30,000 which is in the house to do so. Assisting them is hit man Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello), who turns against them, when they set him up to be the fall guy. Spoilers ahead: Helga, gets killed by Becky after a nasty cat fight (She had it coming to her). Meanwhile, Dosmo ends up meeting Susan (Glenn Headley), who is constantly abused by her snobbish boss Allen Hopper (Greg Cruttwell), and treated worse than his dog. In my favorite scene, Dosmo discovers Susan is Italian (Something in six years, Greg never learned about her because he took no interest in her as a human being), and he cooks a meal (As he is holding them hostage), and has her sit at the table with him, while he eats on the floor with his dog. Other key characters are washed screenwriter Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) who wanted to commit suicide after he found someone to take care of his dog, Nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason), and Detectives Strayer (Jeff Daniels) and Taylor (Eric Stolz).Spoilers: In the end, Lee ends up shooting Taylor, and Dosmo tries to rescue him, but cannot defeat Lee, and both will be killed, except Teddy shoots Lee dead. That action, enables him to get his confidence back and be able to start over with Audrey (Marsha Mason). One other point, about Peppers, you see in the final scene with Audrey, that he is very different than before, and will not only get a reward from the City for saving Taylor, but since he is in screenwriter, he can tell a story (leaving Dosmo & Susan out of course), that could get him a huge advance. Think about it: A Hollywood writer saves a cop, Warner Bros, Paramount, Universal and all the rest would bid on that. I would figure, that should be worth six figures to him. Dosmo and Susan end up with the $30,000 and will go to New York to open a pizza shop (Taylor lets him have it, because he was willing to take a bullet for him (Essentially the hit man turns good guy because of his conscious)). A key theme of the film is second chances for people who were essentially washed up: Dosmo, Susan, Teddy, Taylor (He would have been dead except for Dosmo & Teddy), Becky (Who gets away with it), and last, but not least, Strayer who is abusive cop, who almost shoots a black guy (Due to his temper) and wants to commit suicide, but because of thinking about his daughter does not (He gets a letter telling him to turn in his Badge, for psychological reasons, but although unhappy, at least he tolerates it, and has a chance to get his act cleaned up (Based on the theme of the film, he does). Basically a crime classic 10/10 stars.

    Despite a jumbled plot and some throw away performances, "2 Days in the Valley" will keep first-time viewers involved if just for watching actors who wouldn't normally be in this kind of movie. The main problem is that writer and director John Herzfeld's career has been mainly concentrated on the small screen---and it shows. But that's not a total negative because he does have a gift for moving along a story. In "2 Days..." he certainly keeps the action and dialog flowing at a crisp rate. Unfortunately, the film tries to be both a tongue-in-cheek action film and a Black Comedy and wavers uncomfortably between the two genres. The plot revolves around a murder-for-hire to collect some life insurance money with James Spader playing the hit-man and Charlize Theron as his sexy accomplice. A naive (but beautiful) Teri Hatcher unwittingly aids and abets their plan and ends up the worst for it. Jeff Daniels steals the show as a disgruntled LA cop on the edge of losing his sanity while putting his young partner (Eric Stoltz) through the ringer. Glenne Headley and Marsha Mason, two fine and distinguished actresses, seem a bit lost in this film and neither of them have enough screen time to make a real impression. Danny Aiello and Paul Mazursky are also in the cast and both of them have worked with far better and more cohesive scripts. Louise Fletcher and Keith Carradine have all too brief cameo appearances and neither of them make much of a dent in the proceedings. Carradine is killed off so fast that he might not have collected a paycheck for his efforts. "2 Days in the Valley" will remind viewers a little bit of another film that tried to be too much; the 1985 John Landis film "Into the Night." Similar to that movie, "2 Days..." strays too far from a coherent story line and drifts off into too many directions at once. It won't ruin your evening, but it won't make it any better either.

    I was answering a question about this film, which got me thinking about it, and I decided to write a review about it. In my opinion, this film is a crime classic, and I cannot believe "2 Days In The Valley" (TDINV) is not better known. If you look at the cast you will understand why. It starts with Lee Woods (James Spader), a super cool robotic hit man, and his partner Helga Svelgen (Charlize Theron), who is an ice cold evil blonde. They are hired to kill the husband of Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher), so she can be on the US Olympic Team. They are promised $30,000 which is in the house to do so. Assisting them is hit man Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello), who turns against them, when they set him up to be the fall guy. Spoilers ahead: Helga, gets killed by Becky after a nasty cat fight (She had it coming to her). Meanwhile, Dosmo ends up meeting Susan (Glenn Headley), who is constantly abused by her snobbish boss Allen Hopper (Greg Cruttwell), and treated worse than his dog. In my favorite scene, Dosmo discovers Susan is Italian (Something in six years, Greg never learned about her because he took no interest in her as a human being), and he cooks a meal (As he is holding them hostage), and has her sit at the table with him, while he eats on the floor with his dog. Other key characters are washed screenwriter Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) who wanted to commit suicide after he found someone to take care of his dog, Nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason), and Detectives Strayer (Jeff Daniels) and Taylor (Eric Stolz).Spoilers: In the end, Lee ends up shooting Taylor, and Dosmo tries to rescue him, but cannot defeat Lee, and both will be killed, except Teddy shoots Lee dead. That action, enables him to get his confidence back and be able to start over with Audrey (Marsha Mason). One other point, about Peppers, you see in the final scene with Audrey, that he is very different than before, and will not only get a reward from the City for saving Taylor, but since he is in screenwriter, he can tell a story (leaving Dosmo & Susan out of course), that could get him a huge advance. Think about it: A Hollywood writer saves a cop, Warner Bros, Paramount, Universal and all the rest would bid on that. I would figure, that should be worth six figures to him. Dosmo and Susan end up with the $30,000 and will go to New York to open a pizza shop (Taylor lets him have it, because he was willing to take a bullet for him (Essentially the hit man turns good guy because of his conscious)). A key theme of the film is second chances for people who were essentially washed up: Dosmo, Susan, Teddy, Taylor (He would have been dead except for Dosmo & Teddy), Becky (Who gets away with it), and last, but not least, Strayer who is abusive cop, who almost shoots a black guy (Due to his temper) and wants to commit suicide, but because of thinking about his daughter does not (He gets a letter telling him to turn in his Badge, for psychological reasons, but although unhappy, at least he tolerates it, and has a chance to get his act cleaned up (Based on the theme of the film, he does). Basically a crime classic 10/10 stars.

    I've had this movie in my collection for a few years and just got around to watching it. It was given to me as a gift. I agree with other reviews that it was trying to clone Pulp Fiction, which is a much better movie. There were scenes that I really liked, although it was a little slow in connecting them. The cast was incredible. I just wish there was a little more to work with. Terintino's dialog writing skills would have made this a much better movie. Charlize Theron was incredible. I would have liked to see more of her. The version that I have is the old style snap case and it was widescreen, but not anamorphic.

    O.K. movie. I gave it a 5.If available, I probably would have given it a 5.5. Mildly entertaining. It was good to see Marcia Mason. I think if she lost weight she would still be very attractive. Glen Headly is an outstanding actress and is the only performer in the entire film bringing something new to the screen, as she always does. Loved the fight scene between Terri Hatcher and Charlize Theron. Charlize looks great in the tight jump-suit. It must have been cold on the stage the day they shot the fight scene because she was looking a little "nippley." Best phrase: As Terry Hatcher is rubbing her face into the wall she says,"Like that wall."

    "Two Days in the Valley" is an example of what has become known as "hyperlink cinema", the sort of film which involves several parallel, overlapping story lines. Films of this sort have become popular in the last few years, "Crash", "Babel" and Syriana" all being well-known examples. The introductory storyline involves two hit men, Lee Woods and Dosmo Pizzo, who kill a man named Roy Foxx while he lies in bed with his ex-wife, Becky, a former skiing champion. Woods then betrays Pizzo, shooting him and blowing up their car in order to set him up as the fall guy. Woods's plan misfires, however, and Pizzo survives, albeit injured. Gradually, more and more people become involved in the saga, starting with Woods's glamorous Norwegian girlfriend Helga and Allan Hopper, an art dealer, in whose house Pizzo seeks shelter. Others include Hopper's assistant Susan, his sister Audrey, a nurse, the two police officers to whom Becky reports the killing, and Teddy Peppers, a once-successful film producer now down on his luck and contemplating suicide. Teri Hatcher's performance as Becky earned her a nomination for Golden Raspberry Award for "Worst Supporting Actress". Whether that was fair or not is difficult to say, as I have never seen any other of the other nominated performances for that year, but this film did strengthen my general impression that Hatcher is an actress more at home on television than in the cinema. There were, however, a number of better acting contributions, notably from Danny Aiello as Pizzo, surprisingly sympathetic for a man whose occupation is killing people, Greg Cruttwell as the irascible Hopper, James Spader as the ruthless Woods, whose failure to finish off Pizzo shows that "ruthless" and "efficient" are not necessarily synonyms, and Jeff Daniels and Eric Stoltz as the two cops, Alvin Strayer and Wes Taylor. The two, who are not homicide detectives but vice cops who just happen to be in the area, have sharply contrasting characters. Alvin, the older of the two, is obsessed with driving all prostitutes out of the area, especially Asian immigrants, of whom he has a particular dislike. The young rookie Wes, by contrast, is more concerned with getting out of the vice squad and into homicide, and although Alvin berates him for his lack of knowledge of elementary police procedures it is Wes who comes up with the vital insight into the crime, namely that Becky might know more than she is telling. Charlize Theron, in her first major screen role, looks absolutely stunning as Helga. Despite its ostensibly serious subject-matter, the film never really feels like a traditional crime thriller. Although it revolves around a murder, it has more of the feel of a black comedy, not so much in the sense that it is played for laughs but rather in the sense that is played tongue in cheek. With its quirky, eccentric characters it betrays the influence of the films of Quentin Tarantino such as "Pulp Fiction". Black comedy can be something of an acquired taste, and is a difficult genre to get right, but director John Herzfeld does enough to keep the viewer's interest alive. "Two Days in the Valley" is not a great film, but it is refreshingly different enough from most run-of-the-mill Hollywood productions to make it worth watching. 6/10

    Well, I usually do not bother writing a review where so many exist; and I'm not gonna go into many details. Just allow me to say that I TOTALLY agree with those here who speak very highly of this excellent film! In every aspect where they praise some facet of this movie, they are completely right! Heh, what a way to make a review so dumb-@ss easy... Look, it's one of those clever / dark / funny films that intersects several people involved in basically the same situation. The various parts are brought together well; the acting is excellent all around, etc., etc... The ONE thing I will single out though, and I was quite surprised at this, was that along with the 'Cool' element and very dark humour, their was an amazing emotional factor too which was done quite well. Just little touches that were not necessary for the story at all, but that added a nice heartfelt dimension to what otherwise could have been the usual cool / hip / aloof crime film. DEFINITELY highly recommended and WORTHY of far, Far, bloody FAR higher rating than it has here... Bottom line (and I DO like saying 'Bottom') If you are inclined to like this genre of film at all, then it will be very entertaining and you will frigg'n LOVE it!

    Superb, quirky, comedy-crime film with a super cast. Sharply written with an edge of eccentric energy. A unique movie experience that has some very likable and loathsome misfits that feel as real as they do surreal. Some hilarious bits and gritty stuff going on here and may not appeal to all tastes, but lovers of cutting edge, experimental, although slick, productions will find some very creative turns and an artsy attempt at a combination of touching and heartfelt characters brought together by a psychopathic villain with a very sexy partner. Made just after the mega-hit Pulp Fiction, it inevitably invites comparisons. But this is not a rip- off or an homage, It stands on its own as a fresh film frolic that is as entertaining as it is original.

    I disagree with Berardinelli's review, I didn't find this film very entertaining,. To me it was more like they wanted to make an 'art film' but didn't know how to go about doing it. The movie makers cannot decide whether the film is a comedy, a thriller or something else... A pity, the cast is phenomenal but nothing transpires, other than Charlize Theron showing how stunningly beautiful she was as a young girl... Not even a great performance by Danny Aiello saves the day. I found mostly the Direction and the script to be sorely lacking. This is basically nothing else but a bunch of (decent) cameos clumsily stitched together to resemble a movie. All things considered, in my opinion this is not worth wasting your time on.

    Two hit men Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello) and Lee Woods (James Spader) are making a hit on a cheating husband Roy Foxx (Peter Horton). Before they killed him, they drugged his ex-wife Becky (Teri Hatcher), who was sleeping next to her ex-husband. While Lee double-crossed Dosmo, which Lee thought he killed him by blowing out their car. But Dosmo escaped before the car exploded, now Dosmo finds himself in a nice house with an swimming pool but Dosmo isn't alone. Since he is taking hostage of an mean-spirited art dealer (Greg Cruttwell) and his assistant (Glenne Headly). While Lee went back to his hotel with his Normegian girlfriend Helga (Oscar-Winner:Charlize Theron). Now, the both of them are waiting for their money for their last hit. While two police detectives Wes (Eric Stoltz) and Alvin (Jeff Daniels), who hates each other finds themselves on a crime scene, where Roy died. But Wes thinks, there is something not quite right about the murder. While an suicidal TV Producer Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) is trying to himself unsuccessful but in these two days in the San Frenando Valley nothing is what it seems. Written and Directed by John Herzfeld (The Death and Life of Bobby Z, 15 Minutues, Two of a Kind) made an entertaining Black Comedy that is sometimes very amusing but what makes the movie highly watchable is thanks to a sharp cast. The movie has some surprises and some good laughs. Aiello seems to be having one hell of a time in his role. While Mazursky (Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Moon over Parador, Moscow on the Hudson) steals the show in his supporting cast. Although not a box office success, "2 Days in the Valley" did manage to have an cult following. DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has Cast Bios and the Original Theatrical Trailer. "2 Days in the Valley" is a film that is hardly original but it is clever. The cast are really good and it is nicely shot in Widescreen by Oliver Wood (The Bourne Trilogy, The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Mr. Holland's Opus). There is some familiar faces in bit parts. The feature is certainly worth a look. Panavision. (****/*****).

    Several plot lines involving a multitude of characters eventually come together in this quirky comedy. The cast is awesome, with almost every character played by a familiar face. Despite such a collection of stars, however, the film never really takes off. The main problem is the uneven script that tries to balance too many plot threads and too many characters. Also, although it has its moments, the comedy is not funny enough. Herzfeld, who has mostly worked in TV, is in over his head here on both the writing and directorial fronts. In her first screen credit, Theron is an alluring bad girl and engages in a cat fight with Hatcher!

    I disagree with Berardinelli's review, I didn't find this film very entertaining,. To me it was more like they wanted to make an 'art film' but didn't know how to go about doing it. The movie makers cannot decide whether the film is a comedy, a thriller or something else... A pity, the cast is phenomenal but nothing transpires, other than Charlize Theron showing how stunningly beautiful she was as a young girl... Not even a great performance by Danny Aiello saves the day. I found mostly the Direction and the script to be sorely lacking. This is basically nothing else but a bunch of (decent) cameos clumsily stitched together to resemble a movie. All things considered, in my opinion this is not worth wasting your time on.

    Two hit men Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello) and Lee Woods (James Spader) are making a hit on a cheating husband Roy Foxx (Peter Horton). Before they killed him, they drugged his ex-wife Becky (Teri Hatcher), who was sleeping next to her ex-husband. While Lee double-crossed Dosmo, which Lee thought he killed him by blowing out their car. But Dosmo escaped before the car exploded, now Dosmo finds himself in a nice house with an swimming pool but Dosmo isn't alone. Since he is taking hostage of an mean-spirited art dealer (Greg Cruttwell) and his assistant (Glenne Headly). While Lee went back to his hotel with his Normegian girlfriend Helga (Oscar-Winner:Charlize Theron). Now, the both of them are waiting for their money for their last hit. While two police detectives Wes (Eric Stoltz) and Alvin (Jeff Daniels), who hates each other finds themselves on a crime scene, where Roy died. But Wes thinks, there is something not quite right about the murder. While an suicidal TV Producer Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) is trying to himself unsuccessful but in these two days in the San Frenando Valley nothing is what it seems. Written and Directed by John Herzfeld (The Death and Life of Bobby Z, 15 Minutues, Two of a Kind) made an entertaining Black Comedy that is sometimes very amusing but what makes the movie highly watchable is thanks to a sharp cast. The movie has some surprises and some good laughs. Aiello seems to be having one hell of a time in his role. While Mazursky (Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Moon over Parador, Moscow on the Hudson) steals the show in his supporting cast. Although not a box office success, "2 Days in the Valley" did manage to have an cult following. DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has Cast Bios and the Original Theatrical Trailer. "2 Days in the Valley" is a film that is hardly original but it is clever. The cast are really good and it is nicely shot in Widescreen by Oliver Wood (The Bourne Trilogy, The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, Mr. Holland's Opus). There is some familiar faces in bit parts. The feature is certainly worth a look. Panavision. (****/*****).

    Several plot lines involving a multitude of characters eventually come together in this quirky comedy. The cast is awesome, with almost every character played by a familiar face. Despite such a collection of stars, however, the film never really takes off. The main problem is the uneven script that tries to balance too many plot threads and too many characters. Also, although it has its moments, the comedy is not funny enough. Herzfeld, who has mostly worked in TV, is in over his head here on both the writing and directorial fronts. In her first screen credit, Theron is an alluring bad girl and engages in a cat fight with Hatcher!

    Despite a jumbled plot and some throw away performances, "2 Days in the Valley" will keep first-time viewers involved if just for watching actors who wouldn't normally be in this kind of movie. The main problem is that writer and director John Herzfeld's career has been mainly concentrated on the small screen---and it shows. But that's not a total negative because he does have a gift for moving along a story. In "2 Days..." he certainly keeps the action and dialog flowing at a crisp rate. Unfortunately, the film tries to be both a tongue-in-cheek action film and a Black Comedy and wavers uncomfortably between the two genres. The plot revolves around a murder-for-hire to collect some life insurance money with James Spader playing the hit-man and Charlize Theron as his sexy accomplice. A naive (but beautiful) Teri Hatcher unwittingly aids and abets their plan and ends up the worst for it. Jeff Daniels steals the show as a disgruntled LA cop on the edge of losing his sanity while putting his young partner (Eric Stoltz) through the ringer. Glenne Headley and Marsha Mason, two fine and distinguished actresses, seem a bit lost in this film and neither of them have enough screen time to make a real impression. Danny Aiello and Paul Mazursky are also in the cast and both of them have worked with far better and more cohesive scripts. Louise Fletcher and Keith Carradine have all too brief cameo appearances and neither of them make much of a dent in the proceedings. Carradine is killed off so fast that he might not have collected a paycheck for his efforts. "2 Days in the Valley" will remind viewers a little bit of another film that tried to be too much; the 1985 John Landis film "Into the Night." Similar to that movie, "2 Days..." strays too far from a coherent story line and drifts off into too many directions at once. It won't ruin your evening, but it won't make it any better either.

    I was answering a question about this film, which got me thinking about it, and I decided to write a review about it. In my opinion, this film is a crime classic, and I cannot believe "2 Days In The Valley" (TDINV) is not better known. If you look at the cast you will understand why. It starts with Lee Woods (James Spader), a super cool robotic hit man, and his partner Helga Svelgen (Charlize Theron), who is an ice cold evil blonde. They are hired to kill the husband of Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher), so she can be on the US Olympic Team. They are promised $30,000 which is in the house to do so. Assisting them is hit man Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello), who turns against them, when they set him up to be the fall guy. Spoilers ahead: Helga, gets killed by Becky after a nasty cat fight (She had it coming to her). Meanwhile, Dosmo ends up meeting Susan (Glenn Headley), who is constantly abused by her snobbish boss Allen Hopper (Greg Cruttwell), and treated worse than his dog. In my favorite scene, Dosmo discovers Susan is Italian (Something in six years, Greg never learned about her because he took no interest in her as a human being), and he cooks a meal (As he is holding them hostage), and has her sit at the table with him, while he eats on the floor with his dog. Other key characters are washed screenwriter Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) who wanted to commit suicide after he found someone to take care of his dog, Nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason), and Detectives Strayer (Jeff Daniels) and Taylor (Eric Stolz).Spoilers: In the end, Lee ends up shooting Taylor, and Dosmo tries to rescue him, but cannot defeat Lee, and both will be killed, except Teddy shoots Lee dead. That action, enables him to get his confidence back and be able to start over with Audrey (Marsha Mason). One other point, about Peppers, you see in the final scene with Audrey, that he is very different than before, and will not only get a reward from the City for saving Taylor, but since he is in screenwriter, he can tell a story (leaving Dosmo & Susan out of course), that could get him a huge advance. Think about it: A Hollywood writer saves a cop, Warner Bros, Paramount, Universal and all the rest would bid on that. I would figure, that should be worth six figures to him. Dosmo and Susan end up with the $30,000 and will go to New York to open a pizza shop (Taylor lets him have it, because he was willing to take a bullet for him (Essentially the hit man turns good guy because of his conscious)). A key theme of the film is second chances for people who were essentially washed up: Dosmo, Susan, Teddy, Taylor (He would have been dead except for Dosmo & Teddy), Becky (Who gets away with it), and last, but not least, Strayer who is abusive cop, who almost shoots a black guy (Due to his temper) and wants to commit suicide, but because of thinking about his daughter does not (He gets a letter telling him to turn in his Badge, for psychological reasons, but although unhappy, at least he tolerates it, and has a chance to get his act cleaned up (Based on the theme of the film, he does). Basically a crime classic 10/10 stars.

    I've had this movie in my collection for a few years and just got around to watching it. It was given to me as a gift. I agree with other reviews that it was trying to clone Pulp Fiction, which is a much better movie. There were scenes that I really liked, although it was a little slow in connecting them. The cast was incredible. I just wish there was a little more to work with. Terintino's dialog writing skills would have made this a much better movie. Charlize Theron was incredible. I would have liked to see more of her. The version that I have is the old style snap case and it was widescreen, but not anamorphic.

    O.K. movie. I gave it a 5.If available, I probably would have given it a 5.5. Mildly entertaining. It was good to see Marcia Mason. I think if she lost weight she would still be very attractive. Glen Headly is an outstanding actress and is the only performer in the entire film bringing something new to the screen, as she always does. Loved the fight scene between Terri Hatcher and Charlize Theron. Charlize looks great in the tight jump-suit. It must have been cold on the stage the day they shot the fight scene because she was looking a little "nippley." Best phrase: As Terry Hatcher is rubbing her face into the wall she says,"Like that wall."

    "Two Days in the Valley" is an example of what has become known as "hyperlink cinema", the sort of film which involves several parallel, overlapping story lines. Films of this sort have become popular in the last few years, "Crash", "Babel" and Syriana" all being well-known examples. The introductory storyline involves two hit men, Lee Woods and Dosmo Pizzo, who kill a man named Roy Foxx while he lies in bed with his ex-wife, Becky, a former skiing champion. Woods then betrays Pizzo, shooting him and blowing up their car in order to set him up as the fall guy. Woods's plan misfires, however, and Pizzo survives, albeit injured. Gradually, more and more people become involved in the saga, starting with Woods's glamorous Norwegian girlfriend Helga and Allan Hopper, an art dealer, in whose house Pizzo seeks shelter. Others include Hopper's assistant Susan, his sister Audrey, a nurse, the two police officers to whom Becky reports the killing, and Teddy Peppers, a once-successful film producer now down on his luck and contemplating suicide. Teri Hatcher's performance as Becky earned her a nomination for Golden Raspberry Award for "Worst Supporting Actress". Whether that was fair or not is difficult to say, as I have never seen any other of the other nominated performances for that year, but this film did strengthen my general impression that Hatcher is an actress more at home on television than in the cinema. There were, however, a number of better acting contributions, notably from Danny Aiello as Pizzo, surprisingly sympathetic for a man whose occupation is killing people, Greg Cruttwell as the irascible Hopper, James Spader as the ruthless Woods, whose failure to finish off Pizzo shows that "ruthless" and "efficient" are not necessarily synonyms, and Jeff Daniels and Eric Stoltz as the two cops, Alvin Strayer and Wes Taylor. The two, who are not homicide detectives but vice cops who just happen to be in the area, have sharply contrasting characters. Alvin, the older of the two, is obsessed with driving all prostitutes out of the area, especially Asian immigrants, of whom he has a particular dislike. The young rookie Wes, by contrast, is more concerned with getting out of the vice squad and into homicide, and although Alvin berates him for his lack of knowledge of elementary police procedures it is Wes who comes up with the vital insight into the crime, namely that Becky might know more than she is telling. Charlize Theron, in her first major screen role, looks absolutely stunning as Helga. Despite its ostensibly serious subject-matter, the film never really feels like a traditional crime thriller. Although it revolves around a murder, it has more of the feel of a black comedy, not so much in the sense that it is played for laughs but rather in the sense that is played tongue in cheek. With its quirky, eccentric characters it betrays the influence of the films of Quentin Tarantino such as "Pulp Fiction". Black comedy can be something of an acquired taste, and is a difficult genre to get right, but director John Herzfeld does enough to keep the viewer's interest alive. "Two Days in the Valley" is not a great film, but it is refreshingly different enough from most run-of-the-mill Hollywood productions to make it worth watching. 6/10

    Well, I usually do not bother writing a review where so many exist; and I'm not gonna go into many details. Just allow me to say that I TOTALLY agree with those here who speak very highly of this excellent film! In every aspect where they praise some facet of this movie, they are completely right! Heh, what a way to make a review so dumb-@ss easy... Look, it's one of those clever / dark / funny films that intersects several people involved in basically the same situation. The various parts are brought together well; the acting is excellent all around, etc., etc... The ONE thing I will single out though, and I was quite surprised at this, was that along with the 'Cool' element and very dark humour, their was an amazing emotional factor too which was done quite well. Just little touches that were not necessary for the story at all, but that added a nice heartfelt dimension to what otherwise could have been the usual cool / hip / aloof crime film. DEFINITELY highly recommended and WORTHY of far, Far, bloody FAR higher rating than it has here... Bottom line (and I DO like saying 'Bottom') If you are inclined to like this genre of film at all, then it will be very entertaining and you will frigg'n LOVE it!

    Superb, quirky, comedy-crime film with a super cast. Sharply written with an edge of eccentric energy. A unique movie experience that has some very likable and loathsome misfits that feel as real as they do surreal. Some hilarious bits and gritty stuff going on here and may not appeal to all tastes, but lovers of cutting edge, experimental, although slick, productions will find some very creative turns and an artsy attempt at a combination of touching and heartfelt characters brought together by a psychopathic villain with a very sexy partner. Made just after the mega-hit Pulp Fiction, it inevitably invites comparisons. But this is not a rip- off or an homage, It stands on its own as a fresh film frolic that is as entertaining as it is original.
