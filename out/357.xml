    I find it so tragic that the Chief kills the unresponsive McMurphy because he thinks that McMurphy is ignoring him. It gets me every time. The Chief does not realise that McMurphy has been lobotomised and takes his friends unresponsive state as McMurphy being rude and ignoring him. SO, in a fit of rage - he kills McMurphy. A tragic misunderstanding. If only the Chief would have considered the scars on McMurphy's forehead before getting into a state of deadly aggression. I understand though - that the Chief is a proud man and does not like to be ignored. This tragic and deadly misunderstanding on the Chief's part - that he thinks McMurphy is ignoring him - gets me every time I watch it.

    Based on Ken Kesey's novel about R.P. McMurphy,(unforgettably played by Jack Nicholson, who won an academy award) a rebellious prisoner who fakes insanity in order to avoid a work detail in prison, and is transferred to a mental asylum. He doesn't fool controlling and cold hearted head nurse Ratched(Louise Fletcher, another Academy Award winner). At first McMurphy finds the other inmates funny when they have their group therapy sessions, but after awhile, he comes to care, and even assumes a leadership role, as he inspires them to rebel as well, especially with painfully shy Billy Bibbit(Brad Dourif) who eventually loses his stutter in a key sequence near the end, only to have Ratched cruelly put him down, leading to an extreme turn of events... Whole cast is excellent, script is highly intelligent, both uproariously funny yet also dramatically hard-hitting, with inspired direction by Milos Forman. Ending is both tragic yet triumphant, and may haunt the viewer for years to come. Will Sampson as the silent Indian almost steals the film from Jack & Louise...

    By the time movie ended, I was speechless.. The amazing way human emotions were captured. What a way to bring to the screen, the human psyche. The story starts off as an entertainer, with the build up getting more and more intense with each frame, but that is the underlying theme. As the story moves on it becomes a perfect blend of entertainment and heart rendering narration. The problems that the inmates of asylum face, living in the institution, not understanding what is happening around, and living in a world of there own. Making the asylum a reality. The bus trip scenes highlight the kind of disconnect these people have from the outer world and how there world is so restricted to there own set of walls. Jack Nicholson as a rebel looks exceptional and the climax absolutely stuns you. I bet the auditoriums were dead silence by the end of the movie. Not just Nicholson, every single person has done absolute justice to the roles assigned. Its not easy to act crazy, but it surprises me how strongly, every actor has displayed the character. I guess its a must watch for everyone.

    ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, an exploration of life inside a mental institute in America in the 1970s, is THE definitive exploration of mental illness put on film. It's a classic for a good reason, a movie that has it all: laughs and heartache, drama and pathos, feel-good moments and scenes of pure tragedy. The film is an adaptation of a novel but it's the screenplay which proves so successful, making perfection out of the story elements. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast in the edgy lead role, playing the new guy who comes into the ward to shake things up a bit. Nicholson always has that wild side to him and he plays it perfectly here. As the antagonist, Louise Fletcher has a much more rounded character than you might expect; although she's cast as the villain, she's more complex than that, truly convicted that her ways are the best. The film is also notable for the prevalence of familiar faces in the supporting cast, many of whom went on to better things. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson are the stand-out players, many of them so young as to be virtually unrecognisable, but all revealing the greatness to come. The intensity of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST builds as the story progresses and the stakes are raised, with the narrative in the end proving to be a life and death battle between humanity and the establishment. It doesn't get much more powerful than that, huh? And the ending, although bittersweet, is sheer perfection realised on film. I can't wait to watch this one again.

    Jack Nicholson makes on "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" one of his best performances. This interpretation could be compared with his interpretation on "The Shining" a few years later in 1980. I also liked the performances of Will Sampson as Chief Bromden. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a movie which show us a man (Jack Nicholson as McMurphy) who is committing crimes and then he fakes being crazy and goes to a mental hospital for treatment. In this mental hospital he constantly comes into conflict with a superior nurse who is really strict. He tried many times to escape from this hospital but he did not make it, so he makes a rebellious stance with his inmates against the hideous nurse. Is he going to made it? Is he going to escape from that mental hospital or not?

    Exploring the theme of freedom against the confines of society, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of misfits challenging the morality of established order. With its universal appeal that has transcended time & space and simple, poetic storytelling amidst all the madness, this film, today, is widely regarded as one of world cinema's most respected & greatest films, and deservingly so. Jack Nicholson stars as Randal McMurphy, and if there ever has been a character that Nicholson was born to play, it's none other than the character of Randal. No one else could've pulled off Randal as effortlessly as Nicholson did & he was truly at his finest. Louise Fletcher highly impresses as Nurse Ratched, a character that is completely opposite of what McMurphy represents and the conflicts between these two entirely opposite characters is the defining core of this film, giving us some truly iconic moments. Bolstered by exceptional performances from its entire cast, brilliant direction from Milos Forman, wonderfully adapted screenplay from the novel of the same name and featuring a very unusual score, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an unforgettable story of hope & freedom that in spite of featuring one of cinema's most tear-jerking moments in its final moments wraps itself, as well as its viewers, up with a positive sense of hope.

    It's a shame I decided to watch this movie right after I read the book. I couldn't appreciate it. I watched Jack Nickolson's performance, but I couldn't help myself fighting with the director's decision not to include the Indian's character in the movie. If you read the book you'll see how important he is. And you'll understand that last scene much better. Also, I imagined the nurse being much older and creepier, but I guess this does not have to do with Milos Forman's point of view. I don't want to sound like this, but I really can't help myself, because the book is my personal favorite. Yes, the movie is really good, but I highly recommend you to read the book. It contains a much bigger insight over the cuckoo's nest.

    I haven't read the book, and judging by some reviews, that's for the better. I've watched this one before, but it was a long time ago. The big question seems to be whether or not McMurphy is 'crazy' or not. Well, he is and he isn't.... He is, for thinking he is going on a vacation in a mental institute. But he isn't, for taking on his co-patients as his true peers and the mental mafia (not to badmouth psychiatric aid, but in 'One Flew...' they don't come off quite well) as his enemy. It's a deeply intense story, where many details really boggle the mind. For instance, why does nurse Wretched have such power over Billy? With one reference to his mother being her friend, she instigates his suicide. This should be unthinkable nowadays, as well as back then. This demeaning of patients, which in this particular institution is more rule than exception, can, with the 'wrong' patient in the room, create mayhem. And there is more to be considered; about the behavior of McMurphy and the Chief, as they both are faking. But the problem with that is, no one in their right mind would fake anything just to get into a mental institution. It is another awkward case of that catch 22, where really there is no right answer to the question. The film takes on even more issues when shock treatment and lobotomies come in, which makes this an important film, especially in those days - I'm not sure if it actually influenced anything for the better, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did. The popularity of the book, the play and the film could hardly have gone unnoticed. P.s. I just found out that the writer of the book, Ken Kesey, wanted Gene Hackman in the leading role. Personally I'd doubt very much if he would have pulled it off as greatly as Jack Nicholson did. The rest of the cast was a joy to behold as well, which really helps make this one a true classic. In many ways a perfect film, but still I'd like to have learned more about certain patients (not in the least McMurphy), their problems and the ways the psychiatric staff dealt with them. 9 out of 10.

    If there is any movie that can challenge the reign of "Shawshank Redemption" in IMDb then it must be "One flew over the Cuckoos's nest". It's a movie that will surely trigger some thoughts. Superb acting, super casting, and also sad but still super finishing. It shows us what happiness really means. Without any question, it's the best acting of Jack Nicholson. One will be surprised to find out that how a mental patient can change the life of his fellows. Though sometimes characters lose their exact path, still it's for the ultimate climax. This film also depicts that not only so called cheap commercial movies can attract the attention of mass people but sometimes movies like its can become a blockbuster! A must see movie. I would rate it 10 out of 10.

    Based on Ken Kesey's novel about R.P. McMurphy,(unforgettably played by Jack Nicholson, who won an academy award) a rebellious prisoner who fakes insanity in order to avoid a work detail in prison, and is transferred to a mental asylum. He doesn't fool controlling and cold hearted head nurse Ratched(Louise Fletcher, another Academy Award winner). At first McMurphy finds the other inmates funny when they have their group therapy sessions, but after awhile, he comes to care, and even assumes a leadership role, as he inspires them to rebel as well, especially with painfully shy Billy Bibbit(Brad Dourif) who eventually loses his stutter in a key sequence near the end, only to have Ratched cruelly put him down, leading to an extreme turn of events... Whole cast is excellent, script is highly intelligent, both uproariously funny yet also dramatically hard-hitting, with inspired direction by Milos Forman. Ending is both tragic yet triumphant, and may haunt the viewer for years to come. Will Sampson as the silent Indian almost steals the film from Jack & Louise...

    By the time movie ended, I was speechless.. The amazing way human emotions were captured. What a way to bring to the screen, the human psyche. The story starts off as an entertainer, with the build up getting more and more intense with each frame, but that is the underlying theme. As the story moves on it becomes a perfect blend of entertainment and heart rendering narration. The problems that the inmates of asylum face, living in the institution, not understanding what is happening around, and living in a world of there own. Making the asylum a reality. The bus trip scenes highlight the kind of disconnect these people have from the outer world and how there world is so restricted to there own set of walls. Jack Nicholson as a rebel looks exceptional and the climax absolutely stuns you. I bet the auditoriums were dead silence by the end of the movie. Not just Nicholson, every single person has done absolute justice to the roles assigned. Its not easy to act crazy, but it surprises me how strongly, every actor has displayed the character. I guess its a must watch for everyone.

    ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, an exploration of life inside a mental institute in America in the 1970s, is THE definitive exploration of mental illness put on film. It's a classic for a good reason, a movie that has it all: laughs and heartache, drama and pathos, feel-good moments and scenes of pure tragedy. The film is an adaptation of a novel but it's the screenplay which proves so successful, making perfection out of the story elements. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast in the edgy lead role, playing the new guy who comes into the ward to shake things up a bit. Nicholson always has that wild side to him and he plays it perfectly here. As the antagonist, Louise Fletcher has a much more rounded character than you might expect; although she's cast as the villain, she's more complex than that, truly convicted that her ways are the best. The film is also notable for the prevalence of familiar faces in the supporting cast, many of whom went on to better things. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson are the stand-out players, many of them so young as to be virtually unrecognisable, but all revealing the greatness to come. The intensity of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST builds as the story progresses and the stakes are raised, with the narrative in the end proving to be a life and death battle between humanity and the establishment. It doesn't get much more powerful than that, huh? And the ending, although bittersweet, is sheer perfection realised on film. I can't wait to watch this one again.

    Jack Nicholson makes on "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" one of his best performances. This interpretation could be compared with his interpretation on "The Shining" a few years later in 1980. I also liked the performances of Will Sampson as Chief Bromden. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a movie which show us a man (Jack Nicholson as McMurphy) who is committing crimes and then he fakes being crazy and goes to a mental hospital for treatment. In this mental hospital he constantly comes into conflict with a superior nurse who is really strict. He tried many times to escape from this hospital but he did not make it, so he makes a rebellious stance with his inmates against the hideous nurse. Is he going to made it? Is he going to escape from that mental hospital or not?

    Exploring the theme of freedom against the confines of society, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of misfits challenging the morality of established order. With its universal appeal that has transcended time & space and simple, poetic storytelling amidst all the madness, this film, today, is widely regarded as one of world cinema's most respected & greatest films, and deservingly so. Jack Nicholson stars as Randal McMurphy, and if there ever has been a character that Nicholson was born to play, it's none other than the character of Randal. No one else could've pulled off Randal as effortlessly as Nicholson did & he was truly at his finest. Louise Fletcher highly impresses as Nurse Ratched, a character that is completely opposite of what McMurphy represents and the conflicts between these two entirely opposite characters is the defining core of this film, giving us some truly iconic moments. Bolstered by exceptional performances from its entire cast, brilliant direction from Milos Forman, wonderfully adapted screenplay from the novel of the same name and featuring a very unusual score, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an unforgettable story of hope & freedom that in spite of featuring one of cinema's most tear-jerking moments in its final moments wraps itself, as well as its viewers, up with a positive sense of hope.

    It's a shame I decided to watch this movie right after I read the book. I couldn't appreciate it. I watched Jack Nickolson's performance, but I couldn't help myself fighting with the director's decision not to include the Indian's character in the movie. If you read the book you'll see how important he is. And you'll understand that last scene much better. Also, I imagined the nurse being much older and creepier, but I guess this does not have to do with Milos Forman's point of view. I don't want to sound like this, but I really can't help myself, because the book is my personal favorite. Yes, the movie is really good, but I highly recommend you to read the book. It contains a much bigger insight over the cuckoo's nest.

    I haven't read the book, and judging by some reviews, that's for the better. I've watched this one before, but it was a long time ago. The big question seems to be whether or not McMurphy is 'crazy' or not. Well, he is and he isn't.... He is, for thinking he is going on a vacation in a mental institute. But he isn't, for taking on his co-patients as his true peers and the mental mafia (not to badmouth psychiatric aid, but in 'One Flew...' they don't come off quite well) as his enemy. It's a deeply intense story, where many details really boggle the mind. For instance, why does nurse Wretched have such power over Billy? With one reference to his mother being her friend, she instigates his suicide. This should be unthinkable nowadays, as well as back then. This demeaning of patients, which in this particular institution is more rule than exception, can, with the 'wrong' patient in the room, create mayhem. And there is more to be considered; about the behavior of McMurphy and the Chief, as they both are faking. But the problem with that is, no one in their right mind would fake anything just to get into a mental institution. It is another awkward case of that catch 22, where really there is no right answer to the question. The film takes on even more issues when shock treatment and lobotomies come in, which makes this an important film, especially in those days - I'm not sure if it actually influenced anything for the better, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did. The popularity of the book, the play and the film could hardly have gone unnoticed. P.s. I just found out that the writer of the book, Ken Kesey, wanted Gene Hackman in the leading role. Personally I'd doubt very much if he would have pulled it off as greatly as Jack Nicholson did. The rest of the cast was a joy to behold as well, which really helps make this one a true classic. In many ways a perfect film, but still I'd like to have learned more about certain patients (not in the least McMurphy), their problems and the ways the psychiatric staff dealt with them. 9 out of 10.

    If there is any movie that can challenge the reign of "Shawshank Redemption" in IMDb then it must be "One flew over the Cuckoos's nest". It's a movie that will surely trigger some thoughts. Superb acting, super casting, and also sad but still super finishing. It shows us what happiness really means. Without any question, it's the best acting of Jack Nicholson. One will be surprised to find out that how a mental patient can change the life of his fellows. Though sometimes characters lose their exact path, still it's for the ultimate climax. This film also depicts that not only so called cheap commercial movies can attract the attention of mass people but sometimes movies like its can become a blockbuster! A must see movie. I would rate it 10 out of 10.

    I find it so tragic that the Chief kills the unresponsive McMurphy because he thinks that McMurphy is ignoring him. It gets me every time. The Chief does not realise that McMurphy has been lobotomised and takes his friends unresponsive state as McMurphy being rude and ignoring him. SO, in a fit of rage - he kills McMurphy. A tragic misunderstanding. If only the Chief would have considered the scars on McMurphy's forehead before getting into a state of deadly aggression. I understand though - that the Chief is a proud man and does not like to be ignored. This tragic and deadly misunderstanding on the Chief's part - that he thinks McMurphy is ignoring him - gets me every time I watch it.

    ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, an exploration of life inside a mental institute in America in the 1970s, is THE definitive exploration of mental illness put on film. It's a classic for a good reason, a movie that has it all: laughs and heartache, drama and pathos, feel-good moments and scenes of pure tragedy. The film is an adaptation of a novel but it's the screenplay which proves so successful, making perfection out of the story elements. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast in the edgy lead role, playing the new guy who comes into the ward to shake things up a bit. Nicholson always has that wild side to him and he plays it perfectly here. As the antagonist, Louise Fletcher has a much more rounded character than you might expect; although she's cast as the villain, she's more complex than that, truly convicted that her ways are the best. The film is also notable for the prevalence of familiar faces in the supporting cast, many of whom went on to better things. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson are the stand-out players, many of them so young as to be virtually unrecognisable, but all revealing the greatness to come. The intensity of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST builds as the story progresses and the stakes are raised, with the narrative in the end proving to be a life and death battle between humanity and the establishment. It doesn't get much more powerful than that, huh? And the ending, although bittersweet, is sheer perfection realised on film. I can't wait to watch this one again.

    Jack Nicholson makes on "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" one of his best performances. This interpretation could be compared with his interpretation on "The Shining" a few years later in 1980. I also liked the performances of Will Sampson as Chief Bromden. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a movie which show us a man (Jack Nicholson as McMurphy) who is committing crimes and then he fakes being crazy and goes to a mental hospital for treatment. In this mental hospital he constantly comes into conflict with a superior nurse who is really strict. He tried many times to escape from this hospital but he did not make it, so he makes a rebellious stance with his inmates against the hideous nurse. Is he going to made it? Is he going to escape from that mental hospital or not?

    Exploring the theme of freedom against the confines of society, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of misfits challenging the morality of established order. With its universal appeal that has transcended time & space and simple, poetic storytelling amidst all the madness, this film, today, is widely regarded as one of world cinema's most respected & greatest films, and deservingly so. Jack Nicholson stars as Randal McMurphy, and if there ever has been a character that Nicholson was born to play, it's none other than the character of Randal. No one else could've pulled off Randal as effortlessly as Nicholson did & he was truly at his finest. Louise Fletcher highly impresses as Nurse Ratched, a character that is completely opposite of what McMurphy represents and the conflicts between these two entirely opposite characters is the defining core of this film, giving us some truly iconic moments. Bolstered by exceptional performances from its entire cast, brilliant direction from Milos Forman, wonderfully adapted screenplay from the novel of the same name and featuring a very unusual score, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an unforgettable story of hope & freedom that in spite of featuring one of cinema's most tear-jerking moments in its final moments wraps itself, as well as its viewers, up with a positive sense of hope.

    It's a shame I decided to watch this movie right after I read the book. I couldn't appreciate it. I watched Jack Nickolson's performance, but I couldn't help myself fighting with the director's decision not to include the Indian's character in the movie. If you read the book you'll see how important he is. And you'll understand that last scene much better. Also, I imagined the nurse being much older and creepier, but I guess this does not have to do with Milos Forman's point of view. I don't want to sound like this, but I really can't help myself, because the book is my personal favorite. Yes, the movie is really good, but I highly recommend you to read the book. It contains a much bigger insight over the cuckoo's nest.

    I haven't read the book, and judging by some reviews, that's for the better. I've watched this one before, but it was a long time ago. The big question seems to be whether or not McMurphy is 'crazy' or not. Well, he is and he isn't.... He is, for thinking he is going on a vacation in a mental institute. But he isn't, for taking on his co-patients as his true peers and the mental mafia (not to badmouth psychiatric aid, but in 'One Flew...' they don't come off quite well) as his enemy. It's a deeply intense story, where many details really boggle the mind. For instance, why does nurse Wretched have such power over Billy? With one reference to his mother being her friend, she instigates his suicide. This should be unthinkable nowadays, as well as back then. This demeaning of patients, which in this particular institution is more rule than exception, can, with the 'wrong' patient in the room, create mayhem. And there is more to be considered; about the behavior of McMurphy and the Chief, as they both are faking. But the problem with that is, no one in their right mind would fake anything just to get into a mental institution. It is another awkward case of that catch 22, where really there is no right answer to the question. The film takes on even more issues when shock treatment and lobotomies come in, which makes this an important film, especially in those days - I'm not sure if it actually influenced anything for the better, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did. The popularity of the book, the play and the film could hardly have gone unnoticed. P.s. I just found out that the writer of the book, Ken Kesey, wanted Gene Hackman in the leading role. Personally I'd doubt very much if he would have pulled it off as greatly as Jack Nicholson did. The rest of the cast was a joy to behold as well, which really helps make this one a true classic. In many ways a perfect film, but still I'd like to have learned more about certain patients (not in the least McMurphy), their problems and the ways the psychiatric staff dealt with them. 9 out of 10.

    If there is any movie that can challenge the reign of "Shawshank Redemption" in IMDb then it must be "One flew over the Cuckoos's nest". It's a movie that will surely trigger some thoughts. Superb acting, super casting, and also sad but still super finishing. It shows us what happiness really means. Without any question, it's the best acting of Jack Nicholson. One will be surprised to find out that how a mental patient can change the life of his fellows. Though sometimes characters lose their exact path, still it's for the ultimate climax. This film also depicts that not only so called cheap commercial movies can attract the attention of mass people but sometimes movies like its can become a blockbuster! A must see movie. I would rate it 10 out of 10.

    I find it so tragic that the Chief kills the unresponsive McMurphy because he thinks that McMurphy is ignoring him. It gets me every time. The Chief does not realise that McMurphy has been lobotomised and takes his friends unresponsive state as McMurphy being rude and ignoring him. SO, in a fit of rage - he kills McMurphy. A tragic misunderstanding. If only the Chief would have considered the scars on McMurphy's forehead before getting into a state of deadly aggression. I understand though - that the Chief is a proud man and does not like to be ignored. This tragic and deadly misunderstanding on the Chief's part - that he thinks McMurphy is ignoring him - gets me every time I watch it.

    Based on Ken Kesey's novel about R.P. McMurphy,(unforgettably played by Jack Nicholson, who won an academy award) a rebellious prisoner who fakes insanity in order to avoid a work detail in prison, and is transferred to a mental asylum. He doesn't fool controlling and cold hearted head nurse Ratched(Louise Fletcher, another Academy Award winner). At first McMurphy finds the other inmates funny when they have their group therapy sessions, but after awhile, he comes to care, and even assumes a leadership role, as he inspires them to rebel as well, especially with painfully shy Billy Bibbit(Brad Dourif) who eventually loses his stutter in a key sequence near the end, only to have Ratched cruelly put him down, leading to an extreme turn of events... Whole cast is excellent, script is highly intelligent, both uproariously funny yet also dramatically hard-hitting, with inspired direction by Milos Forman. Ending is both tragic yet triumphant, and may haunt the viewer for years to come. Will Sampson as the silent Indian almost steals the film from Jack & Louise...

    By the time movie ended, I was speechless.. The amazing way human emotions were captured. What a way to bring to the screen, the human psyche. The story starts off as an entertainer, with the build up getting more and more intense with each frame, but that is the underlying theme. As the story moves on it becomes a perfect blend of entertainment and heart rendering narration. The problems that the inmates of asylum face, living in the institution, not understanding what is happening around, and living in a world of there own. Making the asylum a reality. The bus trip scenes highlight the kind of disconnect these people have from the outer world and how there world is so restricted to there own set of walls. Jack Nicholson as a rebel looks exceptional and the climax absolutely stuns you. I bet the auditoriums were dead silence by the end of the movie. Not just Nicholson, every single person has done absolute justice to the roles assigned. Its not easy to act crazy, but it surprises me how strongly, every actor has displayed the character. I guess its a must watch for everyone.

Louise Fletcher highly impresses as Nurse Ratched, a character that is completely opposite of what McMurphy represents and the conflicts between these two entirely opposite characters is the defining core of this film, giving us some truly iconic moments. Bolstered by exceptional performances from its entire cast, brilliant direction from Milos Forman, wonderfully adapted screenplay from the novel of the same name and featuring a very unusual score, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an unforgettable story of hope & freedom that in spite of featuring one of cinema's most tear-jerking moments in its final moments wraps itself, as well as its viewers, up with a positive sense of hope.

    It's a shame I decided to watch this movie right after I read the book. I couldn't appreciate it. I watched Jack Nickolson's performance, but I couldn't help myself fighting with the director's decision not to include the Indian's character in the movie. If you read the book you'll see how important he is. And you'll understand that last scene much better. Also, I imagined the nurse being much older and creepier, but I guess this does not have to do with Milos Forman's point of view. I don't want to sound like this, but I really can't help myself, because the book is my personal favorite. Yes, the movie is really good, but I highly recommend you to read the book. It contains a much bigger insight over the cuckoo's nest.

    I haven't read the book, and judging by some reviews, that's for the better. I've watched this one before, but it was a long time ago. The big question seems to be whether or not McMurphy is 'crazy' or not. Well, he is and he isn't.... He is, for thinking he is going on a vacation in a mental institute. But he isn't, for taking on his co-patients as his true peers and the mental mafia (not to badmouth psychiatric aid, but in 'One Flew...' they don't come off quite well) as his enemy. It's a deeply intense story, where many details really boggle the mind. For instance, why does nurse Wretched have such power over Billy? With one reference to his mother being her friend, she instigates his suicide. This should be unthinkable nowadays, as well as back then. This demeaning of patients, which in this particular institution is more rule than exception, can, with the 'wrong' patient in the room, create mayhem. And there is more to be considered; about the behavior of McMurphy and the Chief, as they both are faking. But the problem with that is, no one in their right mind would fake anything just to get into a mental institution. It is another awkward case of that catch 22, where really there is no right answer to the question. The film takes on even more issues when shock treatment and lobotomies come in, which makes this an important film, especially in those days - I'm not sure if it actually influenced anything for the better, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did. The popularity of the book, the play and the film could hardly have gone unnoticed. P.s. I just found out that the writer of the book, Ken Kesey, wanted Gene Hackman in the leading role. Personally I'd doubt very much if he would have pulled it off as greatly as Jack Nicholson did. The rest of the cast was a joy to behold as well, which really helps make this one a true classic. In many ways a perfect film, but still I'd like to have learned more about certain patients (not in the least McMurphy), their problems and the ways the psychiatric staff dealt with them. 9 out of 10.

    If there is any movie that can challenge the reign of "Shawshank Redemption" in IMDb then it must be "One flew over the Cuckoos's nest". It's a movie that will surely trigger some thoughts. Superb acting, super casting, and also sad but still super finishing. It shows us what happiness really means. Without any question, it's the best acting of Jack Nicholson. One will be surprised to find out that how a mental patient can change the life of his fellows. Though sometimes characters lose their exact path, still it's for the ultimate climax. This film also depicts that not only so called cheap commercial movies can attract the attention of mass people but sometimes movies like its can become a blockbuster! A must see movie. I would rate it 10 out of 10.

    I find it so tragic that the Chief kills the unresponsive McMurphy because he thinks that McMurphy is ignoring him. It gets me every time. The Chief does not realise that McMurphy has been lobotomised and takes his friends unresponsive state as McMurphy being rude and ignoring him. SO, in a fit of rage - he kills McMurphy. A tragic misunderstanding. If only the Chief would have considered the scars on McMurphy's forehead before getting into a state of deadly aggression. I understand though - that the Chief is a proud man and does not like to be ignored. This tragic and deadly misunderstanding on the Chief's part - that he thinks McMurphy is ignoring him - gets me every time I watch it.

    Based on Ken Kesey's novel about R.P. McMurphy,(unforgettably played by Jack Nicholson, who won an academy award) a rebellious prisoner who fakes insanity in order to avoid a work detail in prison, and is transferred to a mental asylum. He doesn't fool controlling and cold hearted head nurse Ratched(Louise Fletcher, another Academy Award winner). At first McMurphy finds the other inmates funny when they have their group therapy sessions, but after awhile, he comes to care, and even assumes a leadership role, as he inspires them to rebel as well, especially with painfully shy Billy Bibbit(Brad Dourif) who eventually loses his stutter in a key sequence near the end, only to have Ratched cruelly put him down, leading to an extreme turn of events... Whole cast is excellent, script is highly intelligent, both uproariously funny yet also dramatically hard-hitting, with inspired direction by Milos Forman. Ending is both tragic yet triumphant, and may haunt the viewer for years to come. Will Sampson as the silent Indian almost steals the film from Jack & Louise...

    By the time movie ended, I was speechless.. The amazing way human emotions were captured. What a way to bring to the screen, the human psyche. The story starts off as an entertainer, with the build up getting more and more intense with each frame, but that is the underlying theme. As the story moves on it becomes a perfect blend of entertainment and heart rendering narration. The problems that the inmates of asylum face, living in the institution, not understanding what is happening around, and living in a world of there own. Making the asylum a reality. The bus trip scenes highlight the kind of disconnect these people have from the outer world and how there world is so restricted to there own set of walls. Jack Nicholson as a rebel looks exceptional and the climax absolutely stuns you. I bet the auditoriums were dead silence by the end of the movie. Not just Nicholson, every single person has done absolute justice to the roles assigned. Its not easy to act crazy, but it surprises me how strongly, every actor has displayed the character. I guess its a must watch for everyone.

    ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, an exploration of life inside a mental institute in America in the 1970s, is THE definitive exploration of mental illness put on film. It's a classic for a good reason, a movie that has it all: laughs and heartache, drama and pathos, feel-good moments and scenes of pure tragedy. The film is an adaptation of a novel but it's the screenplay which proves so successful, making perfection out of the story elements. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast in the edgy lead role, playing the new guy who comes into the ward to shake things up a bit. Nicholson always has that wild side to him and he plays it perfectly here. As the antagonist, Louise Fletcher has a much more rounded character than you might expect; although she's cast as the villain, she's more complex than that, truly convicted that her ways are the best. The film is also notable for the prevalence of familiar faces in the supporting cast, many of whom went on to better things. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson are the stand-out players, many of them so young as to be virtually unrecognisable, but all revealing the greatness to come. The intensity of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST builds as the story progresses and the stakes are raised, with the narrative in the end proving to be a life and death battle between humanity and the establishment. It doesn't get much more powerful than that, huh? And the ending, although bittersweet, is sheer perfection realised on film. I can't wait to watch this one again.

    Jack Nicholson makes on "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" one of his best performances. This interpretation could be compared with his interpretation on "The Shining" a few years later in 1980. I also liked the performances of Will Sampson as Chief Bromden. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a movie which show us a man (Jack Nicholson as McMurphy) who is committing crimes and then he fakes being crazy and goes to a mental hospital for treatment. In this mental hospital he constantly comes into conflict with a superior nurse who is really strict. He tried many times to escape from this hospital but he did not make it, so he makes a rebellious stance with his inmates against the hideous nurse. Is he going to made it? Is he going to escape from that mental hospital or not?

    Exploring the theme of freedom against the confines of society, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of misfits challenging the morality of established order. With its universal appeal that has transcended time & space and simple, poetic storytelling amidst all the madness, this film, today, is widely regarded as one of world cinema's most respected & greatest films, and deservingly so. Jack Nicholson stars as Randal McMurphy, and if there ever has been a character that Nicholson was born to play, it's none other than the character of Randal. No one else could've pulled off Randal as effortlessly as Nicholson did & he was truly at his finest.

The popularity of the book, the play and the film could hardly have gone unnoticed. P.s. I just found out that the writer of the book, Ken Kesey, wanted Gene Hackman in the leading role. Personally I'd doubt very much if he would have pulled it off as greatly as Jack Nicholson did. The rest of the cast was a joy to behold as well, which really helps make this one a true classic. In many ways a perfect film, but still I'd like to have learned more about certain patients (not in the least McMurphy), their problems and the ways the psychiatric staff dealt with them. 9 out of 10.

    If there is any movie that can challenge the reign of "Shawshank Redemption" in IMDb then it must be "One flew over the Cuckoos's nest". It's a movie that will surely trigger some thoughts. Superb acting, super casting, and also sad but still super finishing. It shows us what happiness really means. Without any question, it's the best acting of Jack Nicholson. One will be surprised to find out that how a mental patient can change the life of his fellows. Though sometimes characters lose their exact path, still it's for the ultimate climax. This film also depicts that not only so called cheap commercial movies can attract the attention of mass people but sometimes movies like its can become a blockbuster! A must see movie. I would rate it 10 out of 10.

    I find it so tragic that the Chief kills the unresponsive McMurphy because he thinks that McMurphy is ignoring him. It gets me every time. The Chief does not realise that McMurphy has been lobotomised and takes his friends unresponsive state as McMurphy being rude and ignoring him. SO, in a fit of rage - he kills McMurphy. A tragic misunderstanding. If only the Chief would have considered the scars on McMurphy's forehead before getting into a state of deadly aggression. I understand though - that the Chief is a proud man and does not like to be ignored. This tragic and deadly misunderstanding on the Chief's part - that he thinks McMurphy is ignoring him - gets me every time I watch it.

    Powerful Drama Dealing With "Insanity".

    Based on Ken Kesey's novel about R.P. McMurphy,(unforgettably played by Jack Nicholson, who won an academy award) a rebellious prisoner who fakes insanity in order to avoid a work detail in prison, and is transferred to a mental asylum. He doesn't fool controlling and cold hearted head nurse Ratched(Louise Fletcher, another Academy Award winner). At first McMurphy finds the other inmates funny when they have their group therapy sessions, but after awhile, he comes to care, and even assumes a leadership role, as he inspires them to rebel as well, especially with painfully shy Billy Bibbit(Brad Dourif) who eventually loses his stutter in a key sequence near the end, only to have Ratched cruelly put him down, leading to an extreme turn of events... Whole cast is excellent, script is highly intelligent, both uproariously funny yet also dramatically hard-hitting, with inspired direction by Milos Forman. Ending is both tragic yet triumphant, and may haunt the viewer for years to come. Will Sampson as the silent Indian almost steals the film from Jack & Louise...

    By the time movie ended, I was speechless.. The amazing way human emotions were captured. What a way to bring to the screen, the human psyche. The story starts off as an entertainer, with the build up getting more and more intense with each frame, but that is the underlying theme. As the story moves on it becomes a perfect blend of entertainment and heart rendering narration. The problems that the inmates of asylum face, living in the institution, not understanding what is happening around, and living in a world of there own. Making the asylum a reality. The bus trip scenes highlight the kind of disconnect these people have from the outer world and how there world is so restricted to there own set of walls. Jack Nicholson as a rebel looks exceptional and the climax absolutely stuns you. I bet the auditoriums were dead silence by the end of the movie. Not just Nicholson, every single person has done absolute justice to the roles assigned. Its not easy to act crazy, but it surprises me how strongly, every actor has displayed the character. I guess its a must watch for everyone.

    ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, an exploration of life inside a mental institute in America in the 1970s, is THE definitive exploration of mental illness put on film. It's a classic for a good reason, a movie that has it all: laughs and heartache, drama and pathos, feel-good moments and scenes of pure tragedy. The film is an adaptation of a novel but it's the screenplay which proves so successful, making perfection out of the story elements. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast in the edgy lead role, playing the new guy who comes into the ward to shake things up a bit. Nicholson always has that wild side to him and he plays it perfectly here. As the antagonist, Louise Fletcher has a much more rounded character than you might expect; although she's cast as the villain, she's more complex than that, truly convicted that her ways are the best. The film is also notable for the prevalence of familiar faces in the supporting cast, many of whom went on to better things. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson are the stand-out players, many of them so young as to be virtually unrecognisable, but all revealing the greatness to come. The intensity of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST builds as the story progresses and the stakes are raised, with the narrative in the end proving to be a life and death battle between humanity and the establishment. It doesn't get much more powerful than that, huh? And the ending, although bittersweet, is sheer perfection realised on film. I can't wait to watch this one again.

    Jack Nicholson makes on "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" one of his best performances. This interpretation could be compared with his interpretation on "The Shining" a few years later in 1980. I also liked the performances of Will Sampson as Chief Bromden. "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a movie which show us a man (Jack Nicholson as McMurphy) who is committing crimes and then he fakes being crazy and goes to a mental hospital for treatment. In this mental hospital he constantly comes into conflict with a superior nurse who is really strict. He tried many times to escape from this hospital but he did not make it, so he makes a rebellious stance with his inmates against the hideous nurse. Is he going to made it? Is he going to escape from that mental hospital or not?

    Exploring the theme of freedom against the confines of society, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of misfits challenging the morality of established order. With its universal appeal that has transcended time & space and simple, poetic storytelling amidst all the madness, this film, today, is widely regarded as one of world cinema's most respected & greatest films, and deservingly so. Jack Nicholson stars as Randal McMurphy, and if there ever has been a character that Nicholson was born to play, it's none other than the character of Randal. No one else could've pulled off Randal as effortlessly as Nicholson did & he was truly at his finest. Louise Fletcher highly impresses as Nurse Ratched, a character that is completely opposite of what McMurphy represents and the conflicts between these two entirely opposite characters is the defining core of this film, giving us some truly iconic moments. Bolstered by exceptional performances from its entire cast, brilliant direction from Milos Forman, wonderfully adapted screenplay from the novel of the same name and featuring a very unusual score, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an unforgettable story of hope & freedom that in spite of featuring one of cinema's most tear-jerking moments in its final moments wraps itself, as well as its viewers, up with a positive sense of hope.

    It's a shame I decided to watch this movie right after I read the book. I couldn't appreciate it. I watched Jack Nickolson's performance, but I couldn't help myself fighting with the director's decision not to include the Indian's character in the movie. If you read the book you'll see how important he is. And you'll understand that last scene much better. Also, I imagined the nurse being much older and creepier, but I guess this does not have to do with Milos Forman's point of view. I don't want to sound like this, but I really can't help myself, because the book is my personal favorite. Yes, the movie is really good, but I highly recommend you to read the book. It contains a much bigger insight over the cuckoo's nest.

    I haven't read the book, and judging by some reviews, that's for the better. I've watched this one before, but it was a long time ago. The big question seems to be whether or not McMurphy is 'crazy' or not. Well, he is and he isn't.... He is, for thinking he is going on a vacation in a mental institute. But he isn't, for taking on his co-patients as his true peers and the mental mafia (not to badmouth psychiatric aid, but in 'One Flew...' they don't come off quite well) as his enemy. It's a deeply intense story, where many details really boggle the mind. For instance, why does nurse Wretched have such power over Billy? With one reference to his mother being her friend, she instigates his suicide. This should be unthinkable nowadays, as well as back then. This demeaning of patients, which in this particular institution is more rule than exception, can, with the 'wrong' patient in the room, create mayhem. And there is more to be considered; about the behavior of McMurphy and the Chief, as they both are faking. But the problem with that is, no one in their right mind would fake anything just to get into a mental institution. It is another awkward case of that catch 22, where really there is no right answer to the question. The film takes on even more issues when shock treatment and lobotomies come in, which makes this an important film, especially in those days - I'm not sure if it actually influenced anything for the better, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did. The popularity of the book, the play and the film could hardly have gone unnoticed. P.s. I just found out that the writer of the book, Ken Kesey, wanted Gene Hackman in the leading role. Personally I'd doubt very much if he would have pulled it off as greatly as Jack Nicholson did. The rest of the cast was a joy to behold as well, which really helps make this one a true classic. In many ways a perfect film, but still I'd like to have learned more about certain patients (not in the least McMurphy), their problems and the ways the psychiatric staff dealt with them. 9 out of 10.
