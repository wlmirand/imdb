 <sinopse>
  In this erotic remake of the 1942 classic, a young woman's sexual awakening brings horror when she discovers her urges transform her into a monstrous black leopard.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The Cat People originated way back in time, when humans sacrificed their women to leopards, who mated with them. Cat People look similar to humans, but must mate with other Cat People before they transform into panthers. Irene Gallier was raised by adoptive parents and meets her older brother Paul for the first time since childhood. We follow brother and sister - who seem to be the only ones of their kind left.

    I saw Cat People (1942) for first last week , which I thought was decent and I did not think it was that great but this 1982 one, I thought was great! I really enjoyed the whole of movie, granted the movie could have been little shorter as the were saw calm moment that took bit to long but that my only complaint, The rest of the movie was really well paced and I loved some of bloody moment in this movie, it was very nasty and bloody at times. I love the transformation scenes was ace, I loved that scenes great effect in this movie and I liked how they made this remake more of there and some little nod to the The original like the swimming pool scenes but I do think The original was bit more creepy in that but for me that only decent part in the The original, Really great acting from the whole cast 8 out of 10

    This remake of the 1940's classic, is the cat's meow, literally, especially with beautiful Nastassja Kinski in the starring role! She has one problem though, when she gets sexually aroused, she becomes...well...lets just say, a tad feral. Malcolm McDowell, as Nastassja's brother, always had a penchant for bizarre films & roles, this is no different, as he wants to mate & be mated to his sister for life. This is because their both of the same affliction, sexual arousal causes them to change, to kill, to become a cat! A BIG cat! The only way for them to have sex, & have their partner survive it, is to be an incestuous pair. Though this will repulse people, it makes sense in the film, for our morals don't apply here, & this makes for a unique film of surrealism, as Nastassja spurns her brother for another. The idea of incest repulses her too, but maybe for different reasons than normal. A portrait, a metaphor, of a young beautiful woman coming to grips with her growing sexuality. "The Cat People" is not for everyone, but those of you that are, will know it, as soon as the cat scratches you! The ending scene is as profound as they come!

    Erotic thriller with Nastassja Kinski starring as a young female who's gone searching for her own, inner self. In many ways a remake of the 1942 original, but also in many ways not a remake - a film that stands its own ground, this has a quality of sexual awakening and excitement that the original didn't have. Fabulous music by Giorgio Moroder (also featured is David Bowie's hit-single "Putting Out the Fire") accompanies many of the bloody and sexually occupied scenes that hammers on like they belonged in a artsy-fartsy porn flick. Kinskis performance at the center is typically her: odd, tactless, awkward, outlandish and sensual - in other words, highly enjoyable. She's fantastically beautiful, and she moves through a New Orleans during the fall, shot by John Bailey. And even though the level of thrills ain't always sky-high, the film has a charm and atmosphere that makes it a interesting, stylish and sexy cult picture.

    ...director Paul "Blue Collar" Schrader's "Cat People" is a mostly successful revamp of the Val Lewton 1942 classic, thanks to a sexually charged script by Alan "Dead of Night" Ormsby (tweaked by Schrader), solid performances from a well-chosen cast, fine production design from a lot of Schrader regulars, and excellent cinematography and lighting by John "Groundhog Day" Bailey (another regular Schrader collaborator). The plot centers primarily on the turmoil of female sexual awakening in the personage of Nastassja "Tess" Kinski, freshly immigrated to New Orleans in search of her brother, Paul (Malcolm "A Clockwork Orange" McDowell). What she discovers is ultimately not to her liking, as it turns out she can never consummate a love affair without turning into a big cat and then killing someone (typically the lover) in order to revert to human form. Unless she sticks with incest. Bummer for her. Despite decent critical reception, "Cat People" tanked at the box office, possibly from an ill-timed release date, early spring not being the ideal time for a slick exploitation horror film, no matter its pedigree, and never mind its perversity. It has since maintained a healthy reputation on video, for good reasons: choice nudity, ample gore, flashes of humor ("Top Cat"), and a compelling story with very few "oh, c'mons" that trades on unsettling fears of and fascinations with female empowerment. If I have any real complaints storywise, they would center on the somewhat murky parameters of the transformation from human to big cat (is it volitional, are there specific triggers?) as well as certain questions concerning Irena's ultimate willingness to suffer a submissive fate. But these are small quibbles that don't seriously impinge upon the core story. Kinski and McDowell sell their characters beautifully, while John "Home Alone" Heard and Annette "Smallville" O'Toole are strong foils heading up a support cast that includes Ruby "The Stand" Dee and Schrader favorite Ed "St. Elsewhere" Begley, Jr. Eminently entertaining (and no doubt multiply so for Kinski and/or O'Toole droolers), "Cat People" is near the top of my list of horror movies that might actually deserve another retelling with the right actors and an improved script. Still, Schrader's version is certainly recommended to genre fans everywhere.

    I enjoyed "Cat People" especially for it's interesting beginning and hope for a strong movie. It definitely shows it's age in effects, settings, and most especially music that on the whole I didn't care for. And although not a werewolf tale, people will certainly compare the 2 ideas. (spoilers) Some of the aspects of the movie I liked were the constraints of the fable, and while the character development was a bit mishandled mostly seriously in the way she does a reverse 180 after her brother dies, I liked the movie leading up to that point. The ending is mostly a compromise that makes sense for Kinski's character, but seems sort of too safe. Was hoping there'd be more "Cat People" involved in the story, and a bit more history and development as opposed to violence. Anyway, this is a fair movie and fairy-tale if you can look past it's aging that shows up.

    The original Cat People is considered to be a masterpiece. A masterpiece that sometimes doesn't get as much attention as it should, but still holds a positive view among people. The story is about a woman named Irena who falls for and marries a man named Oliver Reed (no relation to the actor and it's a different last name in the remake). The only problem is Irena believes an old curse upon her people from her native country will turn her into a panther if she gets too upset or displays her love in any physical way. While she's getting therapy Oliver finds out he's actually in love with his co-worker Alice and plans to divorce Irena and the result isn't very pretty. The film was given to Val Lewton to produce with a low budget and no real story behind it. But with a little imagination a lot can be achieved. It specializes for fear of the unseen and psychological messages. We don't know at first whether Irena's really able to change or just crazy at first. The film keeps you guessing with some great build-up and developed characters and some truly suspenseful scenes when Irena decides to follow Alice around. The sequel isn't half bad either showing us a somewhat troubled child and mixing reality and fantasy so well it was shown in college psychology classes. Now the remake is pretty much the same story but with some differences. You see a lot more this time and instead of a psychological tone it takes a sexual tone. Irena now has a brother who like her is one of the Cat People. Instead of Cat People being supposed witches in the myths Irena believed in the original their explained to be the result of children being sacrificed so much to the panthers they become them and can only have safe sex if it's with one another. Her brother desperately craving a passionate yet safe experience stalks her while in the meantime she learns about her dilemma and falls for Oliver. Nastassja Kinski plays a good Irena and while not quite as pitiful as Simone Simon's can still be felt for and Oliver too. The real star is Malcolm McDowell as the brother. He's so creepy and yet somewhat sympathetic too. He's so desperate for a woman to be with who he won't kill he's willing to go as far as mate with his sister. There's a lot of nice visuals and set designs, great lighting many more scenes with the panthers creating a bigger body count as a result. It sort of reminds one of American Werewolf in London at first with the transformations, but there's enough originality to make it it's own movie. The music is great too and features David Bowie doing a short yet haunting song and Paul Schrader's direction is great too. What the remake falls short in is it's ability to reflect the original effectively. Some time in the last third or so it tries to imitate the remake in having Irena stalk Alice in almost entirely the same way though with the pool scene a bit more darkly lit than the original by the look of it making it easier for a panther to hide from the camera. However Alice isn't really with Oliver in the movie (she only wishes they were for the most part) and having done so much to make it it's own movie I feel the times it tries to be a remake almost take away from the plot than add to it this time. I love when a remake can be original and still follow the original, but this time since the psychological and horror tones are decreased for a more sexual and visionary style it makes those scenes almost seem like a completely different movie and makes Irena's motives seem more cruel to Alice than defensive about her relationship. It's as if the movie was meant to be filmed completely differently at first and they decided halfway through filming they should include the stalking scenes even though they not only feel out of place but are never mentioned after wards. It's pacing seems to vary at times too. Overall Cat People is a decent film. Not a masterpiece and not really recommended for those demanding an accurate remake with the same style. Those who just want to see Kinski naked in several scenes and plenty of panther scenes complete with gore and all may feel satisfied. It all depends on taste.

    If nothing else, I'll probably remember Cat People, for its award winning theme from David Bowie, recently reincarnated for Inglorious Basterds, but the movie has a few other things going for it. At first glance it resembles An American Werewolf in London, without the humour, but from a 21st century perspective it reminds me even more of Candyman, which had yet to be adapted for film. Clive Barker's story was more inventive, and the film was scarier, but Cat People (remake or not) is pretty evocative as well. It's not as cheap as it may sound. The animals here are real. If anything Cat People has a bit of a throwback attitude to a time when monsters were sexy, (or some monsters at least). After vampires, cats may be the next most seductive of creatures. So Cat People has a few things going for it, but some things it has too much of. The film is so focused on style, and generally low tones, that it comes at the cost of believable story. The first half is not bad, but the second half feels sort of muddled and confused, not to mention anticlimactic. I like the way the movie ends though, one of those neither happy nor sad finales. So Cat People I suppose is a good movie for the monster fans. It is certainly not as cheap as many others, but its lack of story is somewhat degrading.

    This is one of the most erotic horror films I have ever seen. Cat people who mate with their own kind is typical, but suppose one of them decides to go outside her kind and just want to find romance and not save her species from extinction. The two cat people are orphans and they want to mate with each other because there are no others around. Irena(Nastassja Kinski) and brother Paul(Malcom McDowell) are the last of the breed who follows the way of their kind. Paul on the other hand venture on the hunt and is later found in the city zoo. in panther mode. Irena finds a human mate, and is smitten by him. The brother disapproves, and decides to have him killed. Well he did kill one of the keepers in the zoo by tearing off him arm and he bleeds to death. He really did more damage when he called up a call girl and and attacked her in cat mode. This movie has a lot to go by, the erotica, the mood, the intensity, and the humor this movie got to offer. It's a real keeper in my book. Tired of werewolves or vampires? "Cat People" is for you! 4 out of 5 stars!

    Cat People (1982) This is an archetype erotic film with the beautiful Nastassja Kinski as the sexually conflicted Irena Gallier, Malcolm McDowell as her brother, Paul Gallier, and John Heard as Oliver Yates, her would-be lover. This is not a remake of the 1942 version; it has the basic premise of a woman in conflict, but the sexuality is not sublimated and there are no shadows to hide the gory effects. In this movie, the panther is real, and the forbidden fruit was created specifically to be eaten raw. The reversal of the taboo from the 1942 version is a reflection of the year 1982. In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years. Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view. In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact: If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie: Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena. Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue. Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown. Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling: Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in "Cat People" quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.

    Having just rewatched the original Cat People, I now had to check out the Paul Schrader remake which is set in New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current home city of Baton Rouge (which gets a couple of mentions in the movie). It begins in a dream-like desert of long ago with a woman about to be sacrificed to a black leopard. Before this leopard kills her, he seems to make love to her on the tree. We then flash forward to present time as we see Irena Gallier (Nastassia Kinski) meet her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He lives with an African-American woman named Female (Ruby Dee). When Paul temporarily disappears, Irena goes to the New Orleans Zoo (actually called Audubon Zoo) where she meets head Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his associate Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole). I'll stop there and just say while some scenes seem a bit pretentious (like the POV of Irena when she's a leopard) and the film may be a little long, I enjoyed this version of Cat People almost as much as the original one and appreciated many of the twists and changes made as well as some similarities (like Irena sketching the leopard, a woman saying "my sister" to her in her native tongue, and the pool scene with Alice). In fact, writer Alan Ormsby-with some uncredited contributions from Schrader-expands on DeWitt Bodeen's previous take with modern sensibilities and Southern Louisianaian flavor. Other acting turns I enjoyed include Ed Begley, Jr.'s role as Joe Creigh who provided come comic relief before his tragic scene and N. O. native John Larroquette's cameo as Bronte Judson. And the score by Giorgio Moroder is hauntingly pulsating. In summation, while this version of Cat People can get a little out of hand, it's still quite entertaining in its own part that I quite highly recommend it.

    The original Cat People is considered to be a masterpiece. A masterpiece that sometimes doesn't get as much attention as it should, but still holds a positive view among people. The story is about a woman named Irena who falls for and marries a man named Oliver Reed (no relation to the actor and it's a different last name in the remake). The only problem is Irena believes an old curse upon her people from her native country will turn her into a panther if she gets too upset or displays her love in any physical way. While she's getting therapy Oliver finds out he's actually in love with his co-worker Alice and plans to divorce Irena and the result isn't very pretty. The film was given to Val Lewton to produce with a low budget and no real story behind it. But with a little imagination a lot can be achieved. It specializes for fear of the unseen and psychological messages. We don't know at first whether Irena's really able to change or just crazy at first. The film keeps you guessing with some great build-up and developed characters and some truly suspenseful scenes when Irena decides to follow Alice around. The sequel isn't half bad either showing us a somewhat troubled child and mixing reality and fantasy so well it was shown in college psychology classes. Now the remake is pretty much the same story but with some differences. You see a lot more this time and instead of a psychological tone it takes a sexual tone. Irena now has a brother who like her is one of the Cat People. Instead of Cat People being supposed witches in the myths Irena believed in the original their explained to be the result of children being sacrificed so much to the panthers they become them and can only have safe sex if it's with one another. Her brother desperately craving a passionate yet safe experience stalks her while in the meantime she learns about her dilemma and falls for Oliver. Nastassja Kinski plays a good Irena and while not quite as pitiful as Simone Simon's can still be felt for and Oliver too. The real star is Malcolm McDowell as the brother. He's so creepy and yet somewhat sympathetic too. He's so desperate for a woman to be with who he won't kill he's willing to go as far as mate with his sister. There's a lot of nice visuals and set designs, great lighting many more scenes with the panthers creating a bigger body count as a result. It sort of reminds one of American Werewolf in London at first with the transformations, but there's enough originality to make it it's own movie. The music is great too and features David Bowie doing a short yet haunting song and Paul Schrader's direction is great too. What the remake falls short in is it's ability to reflect the original effectively. Some time in the last third or so it tries to imitate the remake in having Irena stalk Alice in almost entirely the same way though with the pool scene a bit more darkly lit than the original by the look of it making it easier for a panther to hide from the camera. However Alice isn't really with Oliver in the movie (she only wishes they were for the most part) and having done so much to make it it's own movie I feel the times it tries to be a remake almost take away from the plot than add to it this time. I love when a remake can be original and still follow the original, but this time since the psychological and horror tones are decreased for a more sexual and visionary style it makes those scenes almost seem like a completely different movie and makes Irena's motives seem more cruel to Alice than defensive about her relationship. It's as if the movie was meant to be filmed completely differently at first and they decided halfway through filming they should include the stalking scenes even though they not only feel out of place but are never mentioned after wards. It's pacing seems to vary at times too. Overall Cat People is a decent film. Not a masterpiece and not really recommended for those demanding an accurate remake with the same style. Those who just want to see Kinski naked in several scenes and plenty of panther scenes complete with gore and all may feel satisfied. It all depends on taste.

    If nothing else, I'll probably remember Cat People, for its award winning theme from David Bowie, recently reincarnated for Inglorious Basterds, but the movie has a few other things going for it. At first glance it resembles An American Werewolf in London, without the humour, but from a 21st century perspective it reminds me even more of Candyman, which had yet to be adapted for film. Clive Barker's story was more inventive, and the film was scarier, but Cat People (remake or not) is pretty evocative as well. It's not as cheap as it may sound. The animals here are real. If anything Cat People has a bit of a throwback attitude to a time when monsters were sexy, (or some monsters at least). After vampires, cats may be the next most seductive of creatures. So Cat People has a few things going for it, but some things it has too much of. The film is so focused on style, and generally low tones, that it comes at the cost of believable story. The first half is not bad, but the second half feels sort of muddled and confused, not to mention anticlimactic. I like the way the movie ends though, one of those neither happy nor sad finales. So Cat People I suppose is a good movie for the monster fans. It is certainly not as cheap as many others, but its lack of story is somewhat degrading.

    This is one of the most erotic horror films I have ever seen. Cat people who mate with their own kind is typical, but suppose one of them decides to go outside her kind and just want to find romance and not save her species from extinction. The two cat people are orphans and they want to mate with each other because there are no others around. Irena(Nastassja Kinski) and brother Paul(Malcom McDowell) are the last of the breed who follows the way of their kind. Paul on the other hand venture on the hunt and is later found in the city zoo. in panther mode. Irena finds a human mate, and is smitten by him. The brother disapproves, and decides to have him killed. Well he did kill one of the keepers in the zoo by tearing off him arm and he bleeds to death. He really did more damage when he called up a call girl and and attacked her in cat mode. This movie has a lot to go by, the erotica, the mood, the intensity, and the humor this movie got to offer. It's a real keeper in my book. Tired of werewolves or vampires? "Cat People" is for you! 4 out of 5 stars!

    Cat People (1982) This is an archetype erotic film with the beautiful Nastassja Kinski as the sexually conflicted Irena Gallier, Malcolm McDowell as her brother, Paul Gallier, and John Heard as Oliver Yates, her would-be lover. This is not a remake of the 1942 version; it has the basic premise of a woman in conflict, but the sexuality is not sublimated and there are no shadows to hide the gory effects. In this movie, the panther is real, and the forbidden fruit was created specifically to be eaten raw. The reversal of the taboo from the 1942 version is a reflection of the year 1982. In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years. Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view. In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact: If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie: Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena. Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue. Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown. Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling: Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in "Cat People" quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.

    Having just rewatched the original Cat People, I now had to check out the Paul Schrader remake which is set in New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current home city of Baton Rouge (which gets a couple of mentions in the movie). It begins in a dream-like desert of long ago with a woman about to be sacrificed to a black leopard. Before this leopard kills her, he seems to make love to her on the tree. We then flash forward to present time as we see Irena Gallier (Nastassia Kinski) meet her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He lives with an African-American woman named Female (Ruby Dee). When Paul temporarily disappears, Irena goes to the New Orleans Zoo (actually called Audubon Zoo) where she meets head Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his associate Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole). I'll stop there and just say while some scenes seem a bit pretentious (like the POV of Irena when she's a leopard) and the film may be a little long, I enjoyed this version of Cat People almost as much as the original one and appreciated many of the twists and changes made as well as some similarities (like Irena sketching the leopard, a woman saying "my sister" to her in her native tongue, and the pool scene with Alice). In fact, writer Alan Ormsby-with some uncredited contributions from Schrader-expands on DeWitt Bodeen's previous take with modern sensibilities and Southern Louisianaian flavor. Other acting turns I enjoyed include Ed Begley, Jr.'s role as Joe Creigh who provided come comic relief before his tragic scene and N. O. native John Larroquette's cameo as Bronte Judson. And the score by Giorgio Moroder is hauntingly pulsating. In summation, while this version of Cat People can get a little out of hand, it's still quite entertaining in its own part that I quite highly recommend it.

    I saw Cat People (1942) for first last week , which I thought was decent and I did not think it was that great but this 1982 one, I thought was great! I really enjoyed the whole of movie, granted the movie could have been little shorter as the were saw calm moment that took bit to long but that my only complaint, The rest of the movie was really well paced and I loved some of bloody moment in this movie, it was very nasty and bloody at times. I love the transformation scenes was ace, I loved that scenes great effect in this movie and I liked how they made this remake more of there and some little nod to the The original like the swimming pool scenes but I do think The original was bit more creepy in that but for me that only decent part in the The original, Really great acting from the whole cast 8 out of 10

    This remake of the 1940's classic, is the cat's meow, literally, especially with beautiful Nastassja Kinski in the starring role! She has one problem though, when she gets sexually aroused, she becomes...well...lets just say, a tad feral. Malcolm McDowell, as Nastassja's brother, always had a penchant for bizarre films & roles, this is no different, as he wants to mate & be mated to his sister for life. This is because their both of the same affliction, sexual arousal causes them to change, to kill, to become a cat! A BIG cat! The only way for them to have sex, & have their partner survive it, is to be an incestuous pair. Though this will repulse people, it makes sense in the film, for our morals don't apply here, & this makes for a unique film of surrealism, as Nastassja spurns her brother for another. The idea of incest repulses her too, but maybe for different reasons than normal. A portrait, a metaphor, of a young beautiful woman coming to grips with her growing sexuality. "The Cat People" is not for everyone, but those of you that are, will know it, as soon as the cat scratches you! The ending scene is as profound as they come!

    Erotic thriller with Nastassja Kinski starring as a young female who's gone searching for her own, inner self. In many ways a remake of the 1942 original, but also in many ways not a remake - a film that stands its own ground, this has a quality of sexual awakening and excitement that the original didn't have. Fabulous music by Giorgio Moroder (also featured is David Bowie's hit-single "Putting Out the Fire") accompanies many of the bloody and sexually occupied scenes that hammers on like they belonged in a artsy-fartsy porn flick. Kinskis performance at the center is typically her: odd, tactless, awkward, outlandish and sensual - in other words, highly enjoyable. She's fantastically beautiful, and she moves through a New Orleans during the fall, shot by John Bailey. And even though the level of thrills ain't always sky-high, the film has a charm and atmosphere that makes it a interesting, stylish and sexy cult picture.

    ...director Paul "Blue Collar" Schrader's "Cat People" is a mostly successful revamp of the Val Lewton 1942 classic, thanks to a sexually charged script by Alan "Dead of Night" Ormsby (tweaked by Schrader), solid performances from a well-chosen cast, fine production design from a lot of Schrader regulars, and excellent cinematography and lighting by John "Groundhog Day" Bailey (another regular Schrader collaborator). The plot centers primarily on the turmoil of female sexual awakening in the personage of Nastassja "Tess" Kinski, freshly immigrated to New Orleans in search of her brother, Paul (Malcolm "A Clockwork Orange" McDowell). What she discovers is ultimately not to her liking, as it turns out she can never consummate a love affair without turning into a big cat and then killing someone (typically the lover) in order to revert to human form. Unless she sticks with incest. Bummer for her. Despite decent critical reception, "Cat People" tanked at the box office, possibly from an ill-timed release date, early spring not being the ideal time for a slick exploitation horror film, no matter its pedigree, and never mind its perversity. It has since maintained a healthy reputation on video, for good reasons: choice nudity, ample gore, flashes of humor ("Top Cat"), and a compelling story with very few "oh, c'mons" that trades on unsettling fears of and fascinations with female empowerment. If I have any real complaints storywise, they would center on the somewhat murky parameters of the transformation from human to big cat (is it volitional, are there specific triggers?) as well as certain questions concerning Irena's ultimate willingness to suffer a submissive fate. But these are small quibbles that don't seriously impinge upon the core story. Kinski and McDowell sell their characters beautifully, while John "Home Alone" Heard and Annette "Smallville" O'Toole are strong foils heading up a support cast that includes Ruby "The Stand" Dee and Schrader favorite Ed "St. Elsewhere" Begley, Jr. Eminently entertaining (and no doubt multiply so for Kinski and/or O'Toole droolers), "Cat People" is near the top of my list of horror movies that might actually deserve another retelling with the right actors and an improved script. Still, Schrader's version is certainly recommended to genre fans everywhere.

    I enjoyed "Cat People" especially for it's interesting beginning and hope for a strong movie. It definitely shows it's age in effects, settings, and most especially music that on the whole I didn't care for. And although not a werewolf tale, people will certainly compare the 2 ideas. (spoilers) Some of the aspects of the movie I liked were the constraints of the fable, and while the character development was a bit mishandled mostly seriously in the way she does a reverse 180 after her brother dies, I liked the movie leading up to that point. The ending is mostly a compromise that makes sense for Kinski's character, but seems sort of too safe. Was hoping there'd be more "Cat People" involved in the story, and a bit more history and development as opposed to violence. Anyway, this is a fair movie and fairy-tale if you can look past it's aging that shows up.

Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown. Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling: Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in "Cat People" quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.

    Having just rewatched the original Cat People, I now had to check out the Paul Schrader remake which is set in New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current home city of Baton Rouge (which gets a couple of mentions in the movie). It begins in a dream-like desert of long ago with a woman about to be sacrificed to a black leopard. Before this leopard kills her, he seems to make love to her on the tree. We then flash forward to present time as we see Irena Gallier (Nastassia Kinski) meet her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He lives with an African-American woman named Female (Ruby Dee). When Paul temporarily disappears, Irena goes to the New Orleans Zoo (actually called Audubon Zoo) where she meets head Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his associate Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole). I'll stop there and just say while some scenes seem a bit pretentious (like the POV of Irena when she's a leopard) and the film may be a little long, I enjoyed this version of Cat People almost as much as the original one and appreciated many of the twists and changes made as well as some similarities (like Irena sketching the leopard, a woman saying "my sister" to her in her native tongue, and the pool scene with Alice). In fact, writer Alan Ormsby-with some uncredited contributions from Schrader-expands on DeWitt Bodeen's previous take with modern sensibilities and Southern Louisianaian flavor. Other acting turns I enjoyed include Ed Begley, Jr.'s role as Joe Creigh who provided come comic relief before his tragic scene and N. O. native John Larroquette's cameo as Bronte Judson. And the score by Giorgio Moroder is hauntingly pulsating. In summation, while this version of Cat People can get a little out of hand, it's still quite entertaining in its own part that I quite highly recommend it.

    I saw Cat People (1942) for first last week , which I thought was decent and I did not think it was that great but this 1982 one, I thought was great! I really enjoyed the whole of movie, granted the movie could have been little shorter as the were saw calm moment that took bit to long but that my only complaint, The rest of the movie was really well paced and I loved some of bloody moment in this movie, it was very nasty and bloody at times. I love the transformation scenes was ace, I loved that scenes great effect in this movie and I liked how they made this remake more of there and some little nod to the The original like the swimming pool scenes but I do think The original was bit more creepy in that but for me that only decent part in the The original, Really great acting from the whole cast 8 out of 10

    This remake of the 1940's classic, is the cat's meow, literally, especially with beautiful Nastassja Kinski in the starring role! She has one problem though, when she gets sexually aroused, she becomes...well...lets just say, a tad feral. Malcolm McDowell, as Nastassja's brother, always had a penchant for bizarre films & roles, this is no different, as he wants to mate & be mated to his sister for life. This is because their both of the same affliction, sexual arousal causes them to change, to kill, to become a cat! A BIG cat! The only way for them to have sex, & have their partner survive it, is to be an incestuous pair. Though this will repulse people, it makes sense in the film, for our morals don't apply here, & this makes for a unique film of surrealism, as Nastassja spurns her brother for another. The idea of incest repulses her too, but maybe for different reasons than normal. A portrait, a metaphor, of a young beautiful woman coming to grips with her growing sexuality. "The Cat People" is not for everyone, but those of you that are, will know it, as soon as the cat scratches you! The ending scene is as profound as they come!

    Erotic thriller with Nastassja Kinski starring as a young female who's gone searching for her own, inner self. In many ways a remake of the 1942 original, but also in many ways not a remake - a film that stands its own ground, this has a quality of sexual awakening and excitement that the original didn't have. Fabulous music by Giorgio Moroder (also featured is David Bowie's hit-single "Putting Out the Fire") accompanies many of the bloody and sexually occupied scenes that hammers on like they belonged in a artsy-fartsy porn flick. Kinskis performance at the center is typically her: odd, tactless, awkward, outlandish and sensual - in other words, highly enjoyable. She's fantastically beautiful, and she moves through a New Orleans during the fall, shot by John Bailey. And even though the level of thrills ain't always sky-high, the film has a charm and atmosphere that makes it a interesting, stylish and sexy cult picture.

    ...director Paul "Blue Collar" Schrader's "Cat People" is a mostly successful revamp of the Val Lewton 1942 classic, thanks to a sexually charged script by Alan "Dead of Night" Ormsby (tweaked by Schrader), solid performances from a well-chosen cast, fine production design from a lot of Schrader regulars, and excellent cinematography and lighting by John "Groundhog Day" Bailey (another regular Schrader collaborator). The plot centers primarily on the turmoil of female sexual awakening in the personage of Nastassja "Tess" Kinski, freshly immigrated to New Orleans in search of her brother, Paul (Malcolm "A Clockwork Orange" McDowell). What she discovers is ultimately not to her liking, as it turns out she can never consummate a love affair without turning into a big cat and then killing someone (typically the lover) in order to revert to human form. Unless she sticks with incest. Bummer for her. Despite decent critical reception, "Cat People" tanked at the box office, possibly from an ill-timed release date, early spring not being the ideal time for a slick exploitation horror film, no matter its pedigree, and never mind its perversity. It has since maintained a healthy reputation on video, for good reasons: choice nudity, ample gore, flashes of humor ("Top Cat"), and a compelling story with very few "oh, c'mons" that trades on unsettling fears of and fascinations with female empowerment. If I have any real complaints storywise, they would center on the somewhat murky parameters of the transformation from human to big cat (is it volitional, are there specific triggers?) as well as certain questions concerning Irena's ultimate willingness to suffer a submissive fate. But these are small quibbles that don't seriously impinge upon the core story. Kinski and McDowell sell their characters beautifully, while John "Home Alone" Heard and Annette "Smallville" O'Toole are strong foils heading up a support cast that includes Ruby "The Stand" Dee and Schrader favorite Ed "St. Elsewhere" Begley, Jr. Eminently entertaining (and no doubt multiply so for Kinski and/or O'Toole droolers), "Cat People" is near the top of my list of horror movies that might actually deserve another retelling with the right actors and an improved script. Still, Schrader's version is certainly recommended to genre fans everywhere.

    I enjoyed "Cat People" especially for it's interesting beginning and hope for a strong movie. It definitely shows it's age in effects, settings, and most especially music that on the whole I didn't care for. And although not a werewolf tale, people will certainly compare the 2 ideas. (spoilers) Some of the aspects of the movie I liked were the constraints of the fable, and while the character development was a bit mishandled mostly seriously in the way she does a reverse 180 after her brother dies, I liked the movie leading up to that point. The ending is mostly a compromise that makes sense for Kinski's character, but seems sort of too safe. Was hoping there'd be more "Cat People" involved in the story, and a bit more history and development as opposed to violence. Anyway, this is a fair movie and fairy-tale if you can look past it's aging that shows up.

    The original Cat People is considered to be a masterpiece. A masterpiece that sometimes doesn't get as much attention as it should, but still holds a positive view among people. The story is about a woman named Irena who falls for and marries a man named Oliver Reed (no relation to the actor and it's a different last name in the remake). The only problem is Irena believes an old curse upon her people from her native country will turn her into a panther if she gets too upset or displays her love in any physical way. While she's getting therapy Oliver finds out he's actually in love with his co-worker Alice and plans to divorce Irena and the result isn't very pretty. The film was given to Val Lewton to produce with a low budget and no real story behind it. But with a little imagination a lot can be achieved. It specializes for fear of the unseen and psychological messages. We don't know at first whether Irena's really able to change or just crazy at first. The film keeps you guessing with some great build-up and developed characters and some truly suspenseful scenes when Irena decides to follow Alice around. The sequel isn't half bad either showing us a somewhat troubled child and mixing reality and fantasy so well it was shown in college psychology classes. Now the remake is pretty much the same story but with some differences. You see a lot more this time and instead of a psychological tone it takes a sexual tone. Irena now has a brother who like her is one of the Cat People. Instead of Cat People being supposed witches in the myths Irena believed in the original their explained to be the result of children being sacrificed so much to the panthers they become them and can only have safe sex if it's with one another. Her brother desperately craving a passionate yet safe experience stalks her while in the meantime she learns about her dilemma and falls for Oliver. Nastassja Kinski plays a good Irena and while not quite as pitiful as Simone Simon's can still be felt for and Oliver too. The real star is Malcolm McDowell as the brother. He's so creepy and yet somewhat sympathetic too. He's so desperate for a woman to be with who he won't kill he's willing to go as far as mate with his sister. There's a lot of nice visuals and set designs, great lighting many more scenes with the panthers creating a bigger body count as a result. It sort of reminds one of American Werewolf in London at first with the transformations, but there's enough originality to make it it's own movie. The music is great too and features David Bowie doing a short yet haunting song and Paul Schrader's direction is great too. What the remake falls short in is it's ability to reflect the original effectively. Some time in the last third or so it tries to imitate the remake in having Irena stalk Alice in almost entirely the same way though with the pool scene a bit more darkly lit than the original by the look of it making it easier for a panther to hide from the camera. However Alice isn't really with Oliver in the movie (she only wishes they were for the most part) and having done so much to make it it's own movie I feel the times it tries to be a remake almost take away from the plot than add to it this time. I love when a remake can be original and still follow the original, but this time since the psychological and horror tones are decreased for a more sexual and visionary style it makes those scenes almost seem like a completely different movie and makes Irena's motives seem more cruel to Alice than defensive about her relationship. It's as if the movie was meant to be filmed completely differently at first and they decided halfway through filming they should include the stalking scenes even though they not only feel out of place but are never mentioned after wards. It's pacing seems to vary at times too. Overall Cat People is a decent film. Not a masterpiece and not really recommended for those demanding an accurate remake with the same style. Those who just want to see Kinski naked in several scenes and plenty of panther scenes complete with gore and all may feel satisfied. It all depends on taste.

    If nothing else, I'll probably remember Cat People, for its award winning theme from David Bowie, recently reincarnated for Inglorious Basterds, but the movie has a few other things going for it. At first glance it resembles An American Werewolf in London, without the humour, but from a 21st century perspective it reminds me even more of Candyman, which had yet to be adapted for film. Clive Barker's story was more inventive, and the film was scarier, but Cat People (remake or not) is pretty evocative as well. It's not as cheap as it may sound. The animals here are real. If anything Cat People has a bit of a throwback attitude to a time when monsters were sexy, (or some monsters at least). After vampires, cats may be the next most seductive of creatures. So Cat People has a few things going for it, but some things it has too much of. The film is so focused on style, and generally low tones, that it comes at the cost of believable story. The first half is not bad, but the second half feels sort of muddled and confused, not to mention anticlimactic. I like the way the movie ends though, one of those neither happy nor sad finales. So Cat People I suppose is a good movie for the monster fans. It is certainly not as cheap as many others, but its lack of story is somewhat degrading.

    This is one of the most erotic horror films I have ever seen. Cat people who mate with their own kind is typical, but suppose one of them decides to go outside her kind and just want to find romance and not save her species from extinction. The two cat people are orphans and they want to mate with each other because there are no others around. Irena(Nastassja Kinski) and brother Paul(Malcom McDowell) are the last of the breed who follows the way of their kind. Paul on the other hand venture on the hunt and is later found in the city zoo. in panther mode. Irena finds a human mate, and is smitten by him. The brother disapproves, and decides to have him killed. Well he did kill one of the keepers in the zoo by tearing off him arm and he bleeds to death. He really did more damage when he called up a call girl and and attacked her in cat mode. This movie has a lot to go by, the erotica, the mood, the intensity, and the humor this movie got to offer. It's a real keeper in my book. Tired of werewolves or vampires? "Cat People" is for you! 4 out of 5 stars!

    Cat People (1982) This is an archetype erotic film with the beautiful Nastassja Kinski as the sexually conflicted Irena Gallier, Malcolm McDowell as her brother, Paul Gallier, and John Heard as Oliver Yates, her would-be lover. This is not a remake of the 1942 version; it has the basic premise of a woman in conflict, but the sexuality is not sublimated and there are no shadows to hide the gory effects. In this movie, the panther is real, and the forbidden fruit was created specifically to be eaten raw. The reversal of the taboo from the 1942 version is a reflection of the year 1982. In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years. Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view. In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact: If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie: Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena. Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue. Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown. Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling: Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in "Cat People" quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.

    I enjoyed "Cat People" especially for it's interesting beginning and hope for a strong movie. It definitely shows it's age in effects, settings, and most especially music that on the whole I didn't care for. And although not a werewolf tale, people will certainly compare the 2 ideas. (spoilers) Some of the aspects of the movie I liked were the constraints of the fable, and while the character development was a bit mishandled mostly seriously in the way she does a reverse 180 after her brother dies, I liked the movie leading up to that point. The ending is mostly a compromise that makes sense for Kinski's character, but seems sort of too safe. Was hoping there'd be more "Cat People" involved in the story, and a bit more history and development as opposed to violence. Anyway, this is a fair movie and fairy-tale if you can look past it's aging that shows up.

    The original Cat People is considered to be a masterpiece. A masterpiece that sometimes doesn't get as much attention as it should, but still holds a positive view among people. The story is about a woman named Irena who falls for and marries a man named Oliver Reed (no relation to the actor and it's a different last name in the remake). The only problem is Irena believes an old curse upon her people from her native country will turn her into a panther if she gets too upset or displays her love in any physical way. While she's getting therapy Oliver finds out he's actually in love with his co-worker Alice and plans to divorce Irena and the result isn't very pretty. The film was given to Val Lewton to produce with a low budget and no real story behind it. But with a little imagination a lot can be achieved. It specializes for fear of the unseen and psychological messages. We don't know at first whether Irena's really able to change or just crazy at first. The film keeps you guessing with some great build-up and developed characters and some truly suspenseful scenes when Irena decides to follow Alice around. The sequel isn't half bad either showing us a somewhat troubled child and mixing reality and fantasy so well it was shown in college psychology classes. Now the remake is pretty much the same story but with some differences. You see a lot more this time and instead of a psychological tone it takes a sexual tone. Irena now has a brother who like her is one of the Cat People. Instead of Cat People being supposed witches in the myths Irena believed in the original their explained to be the result of children being sacrificed so much to the panthers they become them and can only have safe sex if it's with one another. Her brother desperately craving a passionate yet safe experience stalks her while in the meantime she learns about her dilemma and falls for Oliver. Nastassja Kinski plays a good Irena and while not quite as pitiful as Simone Simon's can still be felt for and Oliver too. The real star is Malcolm McDowell as the brother. He's so creepy and yet somewhat sympathetic too. He's so desperate for a woman to be with who he won't kill he's willing to go as far as mate with his sister. There's a lot of nice visuals and set designs, great lighting many more scenes with the panthers creating a bigger body count as a result. It sort of reminds one of American Werewolf in London at first with the transformations, but there's enough originality to make it it's own movie. The music is great too and features David Bowie doing a short yet haunting song and Paul Schrader's direction is great too. What the remake falls short in is it's ability to reflect the original effectively. Some time in the last third or so it tries to imitate the remake in having Irena stalk Alice in almost entirely the same way though with the pool scene a bit more darkly lit than the original by the look of it making it easier for a panther to hide from the camera. However Alice isn't really with Oliver in the movie (she only wishes they were for the most part) and having done so much to make it it's own movie I feel the times it tries to be a remake almost take away from the plot than add to it this time. I love when a remake can be original and still follow the original, but this time since the psychological and horror tones are decreased for a more sexual and visionary style it makes those scenes almost seem like a completely different movie and makes Irena's motives seem more cruel to Alice than defensive about her relationship. It's as if the movie was meant to be filmed completely differently at first and they decided halfway through filming they should include the stalking scenes even though they not only feel out of place but are never mentioned after wards. It's pacing seems to vary at times too. Overall Cat People is a decent film. Not a masterpiece and not really recommended for those demanding an accurate remake with the same style. Those who just want to see Kinski naked in several scenes and plenty of panther scenes complete with gore and all may feel satisfied. It all depends on taste.

    If nothing else, I'll probably remember Cat People, for its award winning theme from David Bowie, recently reincarnated for Inglorious Basterds, but the movie has a few other things going for it. At first glance it resembles An American Werewolf in London, without the humour, but from a 21st century perspective it reminds me even more of Candyman, which had yet to be adapted for film. Clive Barker's story was more inventive, and the film was scarier, but Cat People (remake or not) is pretty evocative as well. It's not as cheap as it may sound. The animals here are real. If anything Cat People has a bit of a throwback attitude to a time when monsters were sexy, (or some monsters at least). After vampires, cats may be the next most seductive of creatures. So Cat People has a few things going for it, but some things it has too much of. The film is so focused on style, and generally low tones, that it comes at the cost of believable story. The first half is not bad, but the second half feels sort of muddled and confused, not to mention anticlimactic. I like the way the movie ends though, one of those neither happy nor sad finales. So Cat People I suppose is a good movie for the monster fans. It is certainly not as cheap as many others, but its lack of story is somewhat degrading.

    This is one of the most erotic horror films I have ever seen. Cat people who mate with their own kind is typical, but suppose one of them decides to go outside her kind and just want to find romance and not save her species from extinction. The two cat people are orphans and they want to mate with each other because there are no others around. Irena(Nastassja Kinski) and brother Paul(Malcom McDowell) are the last of the breed who follows the way of their kind. Paul on the other hand venture on the hunt and is later found in the city zoo. in panther mode. Irena finds a human mate, and is smitten by him. The brother disapproves, and decides to have him killed. Well he did kill one of the keepers in the zoo by tearing off him arm and he bleeds to death. He really did more damage when he called up a call girl and and attacked her in cat mode. This movie has a lot to go by, the erotica, the mood, the intensity, and the humor this movie got to offer. It's a real keeper in my book. Tired of werewolves or vampires? "Cat People" is for you! 4 out of 5 stars!

    Cat People (1982) This is an archetype erotic film with the beautiful Nastassja Kinski as the sexually conflicted Irena Gallier, Malcolm McDowell as her brother, Paul Gallier, and John Heard as Oliver Yates, her would-be lover. This is not a remake of the 1942 version; it has the basic premise of a woman in conflict, but the sexuality is not sublimated and there are no shadows to hide the gory effects. In this movie, the panther is real, and the forbidden fruit was created specifically to be eaten raw. The reversal of the taboo from the 1942 version is a reflection of the year 1982. In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years. Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view. In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact: If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie: Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena. Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue. Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown. Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling: Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in "Cat People" quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.

    Having just rewatched the original Cat People, I now had to check out the Paul Schrader remake which is set in New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current home city of Baton Rouge (which gets a couple of mentions in the movie). It begins in a dream-like desert of long ago with a woman about to be sacrificed to a black leopard. Before this leopard kills her, he seems to make love to her on the tree. We then flash forward to present time as we see Irena Gallier (Nastassia Kinski) meet her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He lives with an African-American woman named Female (Ruby Dee). When Paul temporarily disappears, Irena goes to the New Orleans Zoo (actually called Audubon Zoo) where she meets head Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his associate Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole). I'll stop there and just say while some scenes seem a bit pretentious (like the POV of Irena when she's a leopard) and the film may be a little long, I enjoyed this version of Cat People almost as much as the original one and appreciated many of the twists and changes made as well as some similarities (like Irena sketching the leopard, a woman saying "my sister" to her in her native tongue, and the pool scene with Alice). In fact, writer Alan Ormsby-with some uncredited contributions from Schrader-expands on DeWitt Bodeen's previous take with modern sensibilities and Southern Louisianaian flavor. Other acting turns I enjoyed include Ed Begley, Jr.'s role as Joe Creigh who provided come comic relief before his tragic scene and N. O. native John Larroquette's cameo as Bronte Judson. And the score by Giorgio Moroder is hauntingly pulsating. In summation, while this version of Cat People can get a little out of hand, it's still quite entertaining in its own part that I quite highly recommend it.

    I saw Cat People (1942) for first last week , which I thought was decent and I did not think it was that great but this 1982 one, I thought was great! I really enjoyed the whole of movie, granted the movie could have been little shorter as the were saw calm moment that took bit to long but that my only complaint, The rest of the movie was really well paced and I loved some of bloody moment in this movie, it was very nasty and bloody at times. I love the transformation scenes was ace, I loved that scenes great effect in this movie and I liked how they made this remake more of there and some little nod to the The original like the swimming pool scenes but I do think The original was bit more creepy in that but for me that only decent part in the The original, Really great acting from the whole cast 8 out of 10

    This remake of the 1940's classic, is the cat's meow, literally, especially with beautiful Nastassja Kinski in the starring role! She has one problem though, when she gets sexually aroused, she becomes...well...lets just say, a tad feral. Malcolm McDowell, as Nastassja's brother, always had a penchant for bizarre films & roles, this is no different, as he wants to mate & be mated to his sister for life. This is because their both of the same affliction, sexual arousal causes them to change, to kill, to become a cat! A BIG cat! The only way for them to have sex, & have their partner survive it, is to be an incestuous pair. Though this will repulse people, it makes sense in the film, for our morals don't apply here, & this makes for a unique film of surrealism, as Nastassja spurns her brother for another. The idea of incest repulses her too, but maybe for different reasons than normal. A portrait, a metaphor, of a young beautiful woman coming to grips with her growing sexuality. "The Cat People" is not for everyone, but those of you that are, will know it, as soon as the cat scratches you! The ending scene is as profound as they come!

    Erotic thriller with Nastassja Kinski starring as a young female who's gone searching for her own, inner self. In many ways a remake of the 1942 original, but also in many ways not a remake - a film that stands its own ground, this has a quality of sexual awakening and excitement that the original didn't have. Fabulous music by Giorgio Moroder (also featured is David Bowie's hit-single "Putting Out the Fire") accompanies many of the bloody and sexually occupied scenes that hammers on like they belonged in a artsy-fartsy porn flick. Kinskis performance at the center is typically her: odd, tactless, awkward, outlandish and sensual - in other words, highly enjoyable. She's fantastically beautiful, and she moves through a New Orleans during the fall, shot by John Bailey. And even though the level of thrills ain't always sky-high, the film has a charm and atmosphere that makes it a interesting, stylish and sexy cult picture.

    ...director Paul "Blue Collar" Schrader's "Cat People" is a mostly successful revamp of the Val Lewton 1942 classic, thanks to a sexually charged script by Alan "Dead of Night" Ormsby (tweaked by Schrader), solid performances from a well-chosen cast, fine production design from a lot of Schrader regulars, and excellent cinematography and lighting by John "Groundhog Day" Bailey (another regular Schrader collaborator). The plot centers primarily on the turmoil of female sexual awakening in the personage of Nastassja "Tess" Kinski, freshly immigrated to New Orleans in search of her brother, Paul (Malcolm "A Clockwork Orange" McDowell). What she discovers is ultimately not to her liking, as it turns out she can never consummate a love affair without turning into a big cat and then killing someone (typically the lover) in order to revert to human form. Unless she sticks with incest. Bummer for her. Despite decent critical reception, "Cat People" tanked at the box office, possibly from an ill-timed release date, early spring not being the ideal time for a slick exploitation horror film, no matter its pedigree, and never mind its perversity. It has since maintained a healthy reputation on video, for good reasons: choice nudity, ample gore, flashes of humor ("Top Cat"), and a compelling story with very few "oh, c'mons" that trades on unsettling fears of and fascinations with female empowerment. If I have any real complaints storywise, they would center on the somewhat murky parameters of the transformation from human to big cat (is it volitional, are there specific triggers?) as well as certain questions concerning Irena's ultimate willingness to suffer a submissive fate. But these are small quibbles that don't seriously impinge upon the core story. Kinski and McDowell sell their characters beautifully, while John "Home Alone" Heard and Annette "Smallville" O'Toole are strong foils heading up a support cast that includes Ruby "The Stand" Dee and Schrader favorite Ed "St. Elsewhere" Begley, Jr. Eminently entertaining (and no doubt multiply so for Kinski and/or O'Toole droolers), "Cat People" is near the top of my list of horror movies that might actually deserve another retelling with the right actors and an improved script. Still, Schrader's version is certainly recommended to genre fans everywhere.

Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact: If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie: Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena. Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue. Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown. Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling: Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in "Cat People" quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.

    Having just rewatched the original Cat People, I now had to check out the Paul Schrader remake which is set in New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current home city of Baton Rouge (which gets a couple of mentions in the movie). It begins in a dream-like desert of long ago with a woman about to be sacrificed to a black leopard. Before this leopard kills her, he seems to make love to her on the tree. We then flash forward to present time as we see Irena Gallier (Nastassia Kinski) meet her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He lives with an African-American woman named Female (Ruby Dee). When Paul temporarily disappears, Irena goes to the New Orleans Zoo (actually called Audubon Zoo) where she meets head Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his associate Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole). I'll stop there and just say while some scenes seem a bit pretentious (like the POV of Irena when she's a leopard) and the film may be a little long, I enjoyed this version of Cat People almost as much as the original one and appreciated many of the twists and changes made as well as some similarities (like Irena sketching the leopard, a woman saying "my sister" to her in her native tongue, and the pool scene with Alice). In fact, writer Alan Ormsby-with some uncredited contributions from Schrader-expands on DeWitt Bodeen's previous take with modern sensibilities and Southern Louisianaian flavor. Other acting turns I enjoyed include Ed Begley, Jr.'s role as Joe Creigh who provided come comic relief before his tragic scene and N. O. native John Larroquette's cameo as Bronte Judson. And the score by Giorgio Moroder is hauntingly pulsating. In summation, while this version of Cat People can get a little out of hand, it's still quite entertaining in its own part that I quite highly recommend it.

    I saw Cat People (1942) for first last week , which I thought was decent and I did not think it was that great but this 1982 one, I thought was great! I really enjoyed the whole of movie, granted the movie could have been little shorter as the were saw calm moment that took bit to long but that my only complaint, The rest of the movie was really well paced and I loved some of bloody moment in this movie, it was very nasty and bloody at times. I love the transformation scenes was ace, I loved that scenes great effect in this movie and I liked how they made this remake more of there and some little nod to the The original like the swimming pool scenes but I do think The original was bit more creepy in that but for me that only decent part in the The original, Really great acting from the whole cast 8 out of 10

    This remake of the 1940's classic, is the cat's meow, literally, especially with beautiful Nastassja Kinski in the starring role! She has one problem though, when she gets sexually aroused, she becomes...well...lets just say, a tad feral. Malcolm McDowell, as Nastassja's brother, always had a penchant for bizarre films & roles, this is no different, as he wants to mate & be mated to his sister for life. This is because their both of the same affliction, sexual arousal causes them to change, to kill, to become a cat! A BIG cat! The only way for them to have sex, & have their partner survive it, is to be an incestuous pair. Though this will repulse people, it makes sense in the film, for our morals don't apply here, & this makes for a unique film of surrealism, as Nastassja spurns her brother for another. The idea of incest repulses her too, but maybe for different reasons than normal. A portrait, a metaphor, of a young beautiful woman coming to grips with her growing sexuality. "The Cat People" is not for everyone, but those of you that are, will know it, as soon as the cat scratches you! The ending scene is as profound as they come!

    Erotic thriller with Nastassja Kinski starring as a young female who's gone searching for her own, inner self. In many ways a remake of the 1942 original, but also in many ways not a remake - a film that stands its own ground, this has a quality of sexual awakening and excitement that the original didn't have. Fabulous music by Giorgio Moroder (also featured is David Bowie's hit-single "Putting Out the Fire") accompanies many of the bloody and sexually occupied scenes that hammers on like they belonged in a artsy-fartsy porn flick. Kinskis performance at the center is typically her: odd, tactless, awkward, outlandish and sensual - in other words, highly enjoyable. She's fantastically beautiful, and she moves through a New Orleans during the fall, shot by John Bailey. And even though the level of thrills ain't always sky-high, the film has a charm and atmosphere that makes it a interesting, stylish and sexy cult picture.

    ...director Paul "Blue Collar" Schrader's "Cat People" is a mostly successful revamp of the Val Lewton 1942 classic, thanks to a sexually charged script by Alan "Dead of Night" Ormsby (tweaked by Schrader), solid performances from a well-chosen cast, fine production design from a lot of Schrader regulars, and excellent cinematography and lighting by John "Groundhog Day" Bailey (another regular Schrader collaborator). The plot centers primarily on the turmoil of female sexual awakening in the personage of Nastassja "Tess" Kinski, freshly immigrated to New Orleans in search of her brother, Paul (Malcolm "A Clockwork Orange" McDowell). What she discovers is ultimately not to her liking, as it turns out she can never consummate a love affair without turning into a big cat and then killing someone (typically the lover) in order to revert to human form. Unless she sticks with incest. Bummer for her. Despite decent critical reception, "Cat People" tanked at the box office, possibly from an ill-timed release date, early spring not being the ideal time for a slick exploitation horror film, no matter its pedigree, and never mind its perversity. It has since maintained a healthy reputation on video, for good reasons: choice nudity, ample gore, flashes of humor ("Top Cat"), and a compelling story with very few "oh, c'mons" that trades on unsettling fears of and fascinations with female empowerment. If I have any real complaints storywise, they would center on the somewhat murky parameters of the transformation from human to big cat (is it volitional, are there specific triggers?) as well as certain questions concerning Irena's ultimate willingness to suffer a submissive fate. But these are small quibbles that don't seriously impinge upon the core story. Kinski and McDowell sell their characters beautifully, while John "Home Alone" Heard and Annette "Smallville" O'Toole are strong foils heading up a support cast that includes Ruby "The Stand" Dee and Schrader favorite Ed "St. Elsewhere" Begley, Jr. Eminently entertaining (and no doubt multiply so for Kinski and/or O'Toole droolers), "Cat People" is near the top of my list of horror movies that might actually deserve another retelling with the right actors and an improved script. Still, Schrader's version is certainly recommended to genre fans everywhere.

    I enjoyed "Cat People" especially for it's interesting beginning and hope for a strong movie. It definitely shows it's age in effects, settings, and most especially music that on the whole I didn't care for. And although not a werewolf tale, people will certainly compare the 2 ideas. (spoilers) Some of the aspects of the movie I liked were the constraints of the fable, and while the character development was a bit mishandled mostly seriously in the way she does a reverse 180 after her brother dies, I liked the movie leading up to that point. The ending is mostly a compromise that makes sense for Kinski's character, but seems sort of too safe. Was hoping there'd be more "Cat People" involved in the story, and a bit more history and development as opposed to violence. Anyway, this is a fair movie and fairy-tale if you can look past it's aging that shows up.

    The original Cat People is considered to be a masterpiece. A masterpiece that sometimes doesn't get as much attention as it should, but still holds a positive view among people. The story is about a woman named Irena who falls for and marries a man named Oliver Reed (no relation to the actor and it's a different last name in the remake). The only problem is Irena believes an old curse upon her people from her native country will turn her into a panther if she gets too upset or displays her love in any physical way. While she's getting therapy Oliver finds out he's actually in love with his co-worker Alice and plans to divorce Irena and the result isn't very pretty. The film was given to Val Lewton to produce with a low budget and no real story behind it. But with a little imagination a lot can be achieved. It specializes for fear of the unseen and psychological messages. We don't know at first whether Irena's really able to change or just crazy at first. The film keeps you guessing with some great build-up and developed characters and some truly suspenseful scenes when Irena decides to follow Alice around. The sequel isn't half bad either showing us a somewhat troubled child and mixing reality and fantasy so well it was shown in college psychology classes. Now the remake is pretty much the same story but with some differences. You see a lot more this time and instead of a psychological tone it takes a sexual tone. Irena now has a brother who like her is one of the Cat People. Instead of Cat People being supposed witches in the myths Irena believed in the original their explained to be the result of children being sacrificed so much to the panthers they become them and can only have safe sex if it's with one another. Her brother desperately craving a passionate yet safe experience stalks her while in the meantime she learns about her dilemma and falls for Oliver. Nastassja Kinski plays a good Irena and while not quite as pitiful as Simone Simon's can still be felt for and Oliver too. The real star is Malcolm McDowell as the brother. He's so creepy and yet somewhat sympathetic too. He's so desperate for a woman to be with who he won't kill he's willing to go as far as mate with his sister. There's a lot of nice visuals and set designs, great lighting many more scenes with the panthers creating a bigger body count as a result. It sort of reminds one of American Werewolf in London at first with the transformations, but there's enough originality to make it it's own movie. The music is great too and features David Bowie doing a short yet haunting song and Paul Schrader's direction is great too. What the remake falls short in is it's ability to reflect the original effectively. Some time in the last third or so it tries to imitate the remake in having Irena stalk Alice in almost entirely the same way though with the pool scene a bit more darkly lit than the original by the look of it making it easier for a panther to hide from the camera. However Alice isn't really with Oliver in the movie (she only wishes they were for the most part) and having done so much to make it it's own movie I feel the times it tries to be a remake almost take away from the plot than add to it this time. I love when a remake can be original and still follow the original, but this time since the psychological and horror tones are decreased for a more sexual and visionary style it makes those scenes almost seem like a completely different movie and makes Irena's motives seem more cruel to Alice than defensive about her relationship. It's as if the movie was meant to be filmed completely differently at first and they decided halfway through filming they should include the stalking scenes even though they not only feel out of place but are never mentioned after wards. It's pacing seems to vary at times too. Overall Cat People is a decent film. Not a masterpiece and not really recommended for those demanding an accurate remake with the same style. Those who just want to see Kinski naked in several scenes and plenty of panther scenes complete with gore and all may feel satisfied. It all depends on taste.

    If nothing else, I'll probably remember Cat People, for its award winning theme from David Bowie, recently reincarnated for Inglorious Basterds, but the movie has a few other things going for it. At first glance it resembles An American Werewolf in London, without the humour, but from a 21st century perspective it reminds me even more of Candyman, which had yet to be adapted for film. Clive Barker's story was more inventive, and the film was scarier, but Cat People (remake or not) is pretty evocative as well. It's not as cheap as it may sound. The animals here are real. If anything Cat People has a bit of a throwback attitude to a time when monsters were sexy, (or some monsters at least). After vampires, cats may be the next most seductive of creatures. So Cat People has a few things going for it, but some things it has too much of. The film is so focused on style, and generally low tones, that it comes at the cost of believable story. The first half is not bad, but the second half feels sort of muddled and confused, not to mention anticlimactic. I like the way the movie ends though, one of those neither happy nor sad finales. So Cat People I suppose is a good movie for the monster fans. It is certainly not as cheap as many others, but its lack of story is somewhat degrading.

    This is one of the most erotic horror films I have ever seen. Cat people who mate with their own kind is typical, but suppose one of them decides to go outside her kind and just want to find romance and not save her species from extinction. The two cat people are orphans and they want to mate with each other because there are no others around. Irena(Nastassja Kinski) and brother Paul(Malcom McDowell) are the last of the breed who follows the way of their kind. Paul on the other hand venture on the hunt and is later found in the city zoo. in panther mode. Irena finds a human mate, and is smitten by him. The brother disapproves, and decides to have him killed. Well he did kill one of the keepers in the zoo by tearing off him arm and he bleeds to death. He really did more damage when he called up a call girl and and attacked her in cat mode. This movie has a lot to go by, the erotica, the mood, the intensity, and the humor this movie got to offer. It's a real keeper in my book. Tired of werewolves or vampires? "Cat People" is for you! 4 out of 5 stars!

    Cat People (1982) This is an archetype erotic film with the beautiful Nastassja Kinski as the sexually conflicted Irena Gallier, Malcolm McDowell as her brother, Paul Gallier, and John Heard as Oliver Yates, her would-be lover. This is not a remake of the 1942 version; it has the basic premise of a woman in conflict, but the sexuality is not sublimated and there are no shadows to hide the gory effects. In this movie, the panther is real, and the forbidden fruit was created specifically to be eaten raw. The reversal of the taboo from the 1942 version is a reflection of the year 1982. In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years. Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view. In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942.

Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue. Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue.

Despite decent critical reception, "Cat People" tanked at the box office, possibly from an ill-timed release date, early spring not being the ideal time for a slick exploitation horror film, no matter its pedigree, and never mind its perversity. It has since maintained a healthy reputation on video, for good reasons: choice nudity, ample gore, flashes of humor ("Top Cat"), and a compelling story with very few "oh, c'mons" that trades on unsettling fears of and fascinations with female empowerment. If I have any real complaints storywise, they would center on the somewhat murky parameters of the transformation from human to big cat (is it volitional, are there specific triggers?) as well as certain questions concerning Irena's ultimate willingness to suffer a submissive fate. But these are small quibbles that don't seriously impinge upon the core story. Kinski and McDowell sell their characters beautifully, while John "Home Alone" Heard and Annette "Smallville" O'Toole are strong foils heading up a support cast that includes Ruby "The Stand" Dee and Schrader favorite Ed "St. Elsewhere" Begley, Jr. Eminently entertaining (and no doubt multiply so for Kinski and/or O'Toole droolers), "Cat People" is near the top of my list of horror movies that might actually deserve another retelling with the right actors and an improved script. Still, Schrader's version is certainly recommended to genre fans everywhere.

    I enjoyed "Cat People" especially for it's interesting beginning and hope for a strong movie. It definitely shows it's age in effects, settings, and most especially music that on the whole I didn't care for. And although not a werewolf tale, people will certainly compare the 2 ideas. (spoilers) Some of the aspects of the movie I liked were the constraints of the fable, and while the character development was a bit mishandled mostly seriously in the way she does a reverse 180 after her brother dies, I liked the movie leading up to that point. The ending is mostly a compromise that makes sense for Kinski's character, but seems sort of too safe. Was hoping there'd be more "Cat People" involved in the story, and a bit more history and development as opposed to violence. Anyway, this is a fair movie and fairy-tale if you can look past it's aging that shows up.

    The original Cat People is considered to be a masterpiece. A masterpiece that sometimes doesn't get as much attention as it should, but still holds a positive view among people. The story is about a woman named Irena who falls for and marries a man named Oliver Reed (no relation to the actor and it's a different last name in the remake). The only problem is Irena believes an old curse upon her people from her native country will turn her into a panther if she gets too upset or displays her love in any physical way. While she's getting therapy Oliver finds out he's actually in love with his co-worker Alice and plans to divorce Irena and the result isn't very pretty. The film was given to Val Lewton to produce with a low budget and no real story behind it. But with a little imagination a lot can be achieved. It specializes for fear of the unseen and psychological messages. We don't know at first whether Irena's really able to change or just crazy at first. The film keeps you guessing with some great build-up and developed characters and some truly suspenseful scenes when Irena decides to follow Alice around. The sequel isn't half bad either showing us a somewhat troubled child and mixing reality and fantasy so well it was shown in college psychology classes. Now the remake is pretty much the same story but with some differences. You see a lot more this time and instead of a psychological tone it takes a sexual tone. Irena now has a brother who like her is one of the Cat People. Instead of Cat People being supposed witches in the myths Irena believed in the original their explained to be the result of children being sacrificed so much to the panthers they become them and can only have safe sex if it's with one another. Her brother desperately craving a passionate yet safe experience stalks her while in the meantime she learns about her dilemma and falls for Oliver. Nastassja Kinski plays a good Irena and while not quite as pitiful as Simone Simon's can still be felt for and Oliver too. The real star is Malcolm McDowell as the brother. He's so creepy and yet somewhat sympathetic too. He's so desperate for a woman to be with who he won't kill he's willing to go as far as mate with his sister. There's a lot of nice visuals and set designs, great lighting many more scenes with the panthers creating a bigger body count as a result. It sort of reminds one of American Werewolf in London at first with the transformations, but there's enough originality to make it it's own movie. The music is great too and features David Bowie doing a short yet haunting song and Paul Schrader's direction is great too. What the remake falls short in is it's ability to reflect the original effectively. Some time in the last third or so it tries to imitate the remake in having Irena stalk Alice in almost entirely the same way though with the pool scene a bit more darkly lit than the original by the look of it making it easier for a panther to hide from the camera. However Alice isn't really with Oliver in the movie (she only wishes they were for the most part) and having done so much to make it it's own movie I feel the times it tries to be a remake almost take away from the plot than add to it this time. I love when a remake can be original and still follow the original, but this time since the psychological and horror tones are decreased for a more sexual and visionary style it makes those scenes almost seem like a completely different movie and makes Irena's motives seem more cruel to Alice than defensive about her relationship. It's as if the movie was meant to be filmed completely differently at first and they decided halfway through filming they should include the stalking scenes even though they not only feel out of place but are never mentioned after wards. It's pacing seems to vary at times too. Overall Cat People is a decent film. Not a masterpiece and not really recommended for those demanding an accurate remake with the same style. Those who just want to see Kinski naked in several scenes and plenty of panther scenes complete with gore and all may feel satisfied. It all depends on taste.

    If nothing else, I'll probably remember Cat People, for its award winning theme from David Bowie, recently reincarnated for Inglorious Basterds, but the movie has a few other things going for it. At first glance it resembles An American Werewolf in London, without the humour, but from a 21st century perspective it reminds me even more of Candyman, which had yet to be adapted for film. Clive Barker's story was more inventive, and the film was scarier, but Cat People (remake or not) is pretty evocative as well. It's not as cheap as it may sound. The animals here are real. If anything Cat People has a bit of a throwback attitude to a time when monsters were sexy, (or some monsters at least). After vampires, cats may be the next most seductive of creatures. So Cat People has a few things going for it, but some things it has too much of. The film is so focused on style, and generally low tones, that it comes at the cost of believable story. The first half is not bad, but the second half feels sort of muddled and confused, not to mention anticlimactic. I like the way the movie ends though, one of those neither happy nor sad finales. So Cat People I suppose is a good movie for the monster fans. It is certainly not as cheap as many others, but its lack of story is somewhat degrading.

    This is one of the most erotic horror films I have ever seen. Cat people who mate with their own kind is typical, but suppose one of them decides to go outside her kind and just want to find romance and not save her species from extinction. The two cat people are orphans and they want to mate with each other because there are no others around. Irena(Nastassja Kinski) and brother Paul(Malcom McDowell) are the last of the breed who follows the way of their kind. Paul on the other hand venture on the hunt and is later found in the city zoo. in panther mode. Irena finds a human mate, and is smitten by him. The brother disapproves, and decides to have him killed. Well he did kill one of the keepers in the zoo by tearing off him arm and he bleeds to death. He really did more damage when he called up a call girl and and attacked her in cat mode. This movie has a lot to go by, the erotica, the mood, the intensity, and the humor this movie got to offer. It's a real keeper in my book. Tired of werewolves or vampires? "Cat People" is for you! 4 out of 5 stars!

    Cat People (1982) This is an archetype erotic film with the beautiful Nastassja Kinski as the sexually conflicted Irena Gallier, Malcolm McDowell as her brother, Paul Gallier, and John Heard as Oliver Yates, her would-be lover. This is not a remake of the 1942 version; it has the basic premise of a woman in conflict, but the sexuality is not sublimated and there are no shadows to hide the gory effects. In this movie, the panther is real, and the forbidden fruit was created specifically to be eaten raw. The reversal of the taboo from the 1942 version is a reflection of the year 1982. In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years. Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view. In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact: If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie: Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena. Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue. Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown. Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling: Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in "Cat People" quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.

    Having just rewatched the original Cat People, I now had to check out the Paul Schrader remake which is set in New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current home city of Baton Rouge (which gets a couple of mentions in the movie). It begins in a dream-like desert of long ago with a woman about to be sacrificed to a black leopard. Before this leopard kills her, he seems to make love to her on the tree. We then flash forward to present time as we see Irena Gallier (Nastassia Kinski) meet her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He lives with an African-American woman named Female (Ruby Dee). When Paul temporarily disappears, Irena goes to the New Orleans Zoo (actually called Audubon Zoo) where she meets head Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his associate Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole). I'll stop there and just say while some scenes seem a bit pretentious (like the POV of Irena when she's a leopard) and the film may be a little long, I enjoyed this version of Cat People almost as much as the original one and appreciated many of the twists and changes made as well as some similarities (like Irena sketching the leopard, a woman saying "my sister" to her in her native tongue, and the pool scene with Alice). In fact, writer Alan Ormsby-with some uncredited contributions from Schrader-expands on DeWitt Bodeen's previous take with modern sensibilities and Southern Louisianaian flavor. Other acting turns I enjoyed include Ed Begley, Jr.'s role as Joe Creigh who provided come comic relief before his tragic scene and N. O. native John Larroquette's cameo as Bronte Judson. And the score by Giorgio Moroder is hauntingly pulsating. In summation, while this version of Cat People can get a little out of hand, it's still quite entertaining in its own part that I quite highly recommend it.

    I saw Cat People (1942) for first last week , which I thought was decent and I did not think it was that great but this 1982 one, I thought was great! I really enjoyed the whole of movie, granted the movie could have been little shorter as the were saw calm moment that took bit to long but that my only complaint, The rest of the movie was really well paced and I loved some of bloody moment in this movie, it was very nasty and bloody at times. I love the transformation scenes was ace, I loved that scenes great effect in this movie and I liked how they made this remake more of there and some little nod to the The original like the swimming pool scenes but I do think The original was bit more creepy in that but for me that only decent part in the The original, Really great acting from the whole cast 8 out of 10

    This remake of the 1940's classic, is the cat's meow, literally, especially with beautiful Nastassja Kinski in the starring role! She has one problem though, when she gets sexually aroused, she becomes...well...lets just say, a tad feral. Malcolm McDowell, as Nastassja's brother, always had a penchant for bizarre films & roles, this is no different, as he wants to mate & be mated to his sister for life. This is because their both of the same affliction, sexual arousal causes them to change, to kill, to become a cat! A BIG cat! The only way for them to have sex, & have their partner survive it, is to be an incestuous pair. Though this will repulse people, it makes sense in the film, for our morals don't apply here, & this makes for a unique film of surrealism, as Nastassja spurns her brother for another. The idea of incest repulses her too, but maybe for different reasons than normal. A portrait, a metaphor, of a young beautiful woman coming to grips with her growing sexuality. "The Cat People" is not for everyone, but those of you that are, will know it, as soon as the cat scratches you! The ending scene is as profound as they come!

    Erotic thriller with Nastassja Kinski starring as a young female who's gone searching for her own, inner self. In many ways a remake of the 1942 original, but also in many ways not a remake - a film that stands its own ground, this has a quality of sexual awakening and excitement that the original didn't have. Fabulous music by Giorgio Moroder (also featured is David Bowie's hit-single "Putting Out the Fire") accompanies many of the bloody and sexually occupied scenes that hammers on like they belonged in a artsy-fartsy porn flick. Kinskis performance at the center is typically her: odd, tactless, awkward, outlandish and sensual - in other words, highly enjoyable. She's fantastically beautiful, and she moves through a New Orleans during the fall, shot by John Bailey. And even though the level of thrills ain't always sky-high, the film has a charm and atmosphere that makes it a interesting, stylish and sexy cult picture.

    ...director Paul "Blue Collar" Schrader's "Cat People" is a mostly successful revamp of the Val Lewton 1942 classic, thanks to a sexually charged script by Alan "Dead of Night" Ormsby (tweaked by Schrader), solid performances from a well-chosen cast, fine production design from a lot of Schrader regulars, and excellent cinematography and lighting by John "Groundhog Day" Bailey (another regular Schrader collaborator). The plot centers primarily on the turmoil of female sexual awakening in the personage of Nastassja "Tess" Kinski, freshly immigrated to New Orleans in search of her brother, Paul (Malcolm "A Clockwork Orange" McDowell). What she discovers is ultimately not to her liking, as it turns out she can never consummate a love affair without turning into a big cat and then killing someone (typically the lover) in order to revert to human form. Unless she sticks with incest. Bummer for her. Despite decent critical reception, "Cat People" tanked at the box office, possibly from an ill-timed release date, early spring not being the ideal time for a slick exploitation horror film, no matter its pedigree, and never mind its perversity. It has since maintained a healthy reputation on video, for good reasons: choice nudity, ample gore, flashes of humor ("Top Cat"), and a compelling story with very few "oh, c'mons" that trades on unsettling fears of and fascinations with female empowerment. If I have any real complaints storywise, they would center on the somewhat murky parameters of the transformation from human to big cat (is it volitional, are there specific triggers?) as well as certain questions concerning Irena's ultimate willingness to suffer a submissive fate. But these are small quibbles that don't seriously impinge upon the core story. Kinski and McDowell sell their characters beautifully, while John "Home Alone" Heard and Annette "Smallville" O'Toole are strong foils heading up a support cast that includes Ruby "The Stand" Dee and Schrader favorite Ed "St. Elsewhere" Begley, Jr. Eminently entertaining (and no doubt multiply so for Kinski and/or O'Toole droolers), "Cat People" is near the top of my list of horror movies that might actually deserve another retelling with the right actors and an improved script. Still, Schrader's version is certainly recommended to genre fans everywhere.

    Cat People (1982) This is an archetype erotic film with the beautiful Nastassja Kinski as the sexually conflicted Irena Gallier, Malcolm McDowell as her brother, Paul Gallier, and John Heard as Oliver Yates, her would-be lover. This is not a remake of the 1942 version; it has the basic premise of a woman in conflict, but the sexuality is not sublimated and there are no shadows to hide the gory effects. In this movie, the panther is real, and the forbidden fruit was created specifically to be eaten raw. The reversal of the taboo from the 1942 version is a reflection of the year 1982. In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years. Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view. In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact: If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie: Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena. Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue. Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown. Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling: Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in "Cat People" quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.

    Having just rewatched the original Cat People, I now had to check out the Paul Schrader remake which is set in New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current home city of Baton Rouge (which gets a couple of mentions in the movie). It begins in a dream-like desert of long ago with a woman about to be sacrificed to a black leopard. Before this leopard kills her, he seems to make love to her on the tree. We then flash forward to present time as we see Irena Gallier (Nastassia Kinski) meet her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He lives with an African-American woman named Female (Ruby Dee). When Paul temporarily disappears, Irena goes to the New Orleans Zoo (actually called Audubon Zoo) where she meets head Oliver Yates (John Heard) and his associate Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole). I'll stop there and just say while some scenes seem a bit pretentious (like the POV of Irena when she's a leopard) and the film may be a little long, I enjoyed this version of Cat People almost as much as the original one and appreciated many of the twists and changes made as well as some similarities (like Irena sketching the leopard, a woman saying "my sister" to her in her native tongue, and the pool scene with Alice). In fact, writer Alan Ormsby-with some uncredited contributions from Schrader-expands on DeWitt Bodeen's previous take with modern sensibilities and Southern Louisianaian flavor. Other acting turns I enjoyed include Ed Begley, Jr.'s role as Joe Creigh who provided come comic relief before his tragic scene and N. O. native John Larroquette's cameo as Bronte Judson. And the score by Giorgio Moroder is hauntingly pulsating. In summation, while this version of Cat People can get a little out of hand, it's still quite entertaining in its own part that I quite highly recommend it.

    I saw Cat People (1942) for first last week , which I thought was decent and I did not think it was that great but this 1982 one, I thought was great! I really enjoyed the whole of movie, granted the movie could have been little shorter as the were saw calm moment that took bit to long but that my only complaint, The rest of the movie was really well paced and I loved some of bloody moment in this movie, it was very nasty and bloody at times. I love the transformation scenes was ace, I loved that scenes great effect in this movie and I liked how they made this remake more of there and some little nod to the The original like the swimming pool scenes but I do think The original was bit more creepy in that but for me that only decent part in the The original, Really great acting from the whole cast 8 out of 10

    This remake of the 1940's classic, is the cat's meow, literally, especially with beautiful Nastassja Kinski in the starring role! She has one problem though, when she gets sexually aroused, she becomes...well...lets just say, a tad feral. Malcolm McDowell, as Nastassja's brother, always had a penchant for bizarre films & roles, this is no different, as he wants to mate & be mated to his sister for life. This is because their both of the same affliction, sexual arousal causes them to change, to kill, to become a cat! A BIG cat! The only way for them to have sex, & have their partner survive it, is to be an incestuous pair. Though this will repulse people, it makes sense in the film, for our morals don't apply here, & this makes for a unique film of surrealism, as Nastassja spurns her brother for another. The idea of incest repulses her too, but maybe for different reasons than normal. A portrait, a metaphor, of a young beautiful woman coming to grips with her growing sexuality. "The Cat People" is not for everyone, but those of you that are, will know it, as soon as the cat scratches you! The ending scene is as profound as they come!

    Erotic thriller with Nastassja Kinski starring as a young female who's gone searching for her own, inner self. In many ways a remake of the 1942 original, but also in many ways not a remake - a film that stands its own ground, this has a quality of sexual awakening and excitement that the original didn't have. Fabulous music by Giorgio Moroder (also featured is David Bowie's hit-single "Putting Out the Fire") accompanies many of the bloody and sexually occupied scenes that hammers on like they belonged in a artsy-fartsy porn flick. Kinskis performance at the center is typically her: odd, tactless, awkward, outlandish and sensual - in other words, highly enjoyable. She's fantastically beautiful, and she moves through a New Orleans during the fall, shot by John Bailey. And even though the level of thrills ain't always sky-high, the film has a charm and atmosphere that makes it a interesting, stylish and sexy cult picture.

    ...director Paul "Blue Collar" Schrader's "Cat People" is a mostly successful revamp of the Val Lewton 1942 classic, thanks to a sexually charged script by Alan "Dead of Night" Ormsby (tweaked by Schrader), solid performances from a well-chosen cast, fine production design from a lot of Schrader regulars, and excellent cinematography and lighting by John "Groundhog Day" Bailey (another regular Schrader collaborator). The plot centers primarily on the turmoil of female sexual awakening in the personage of Nastassja "Tess" Kinski, freshly immigrated to New Orleans in search of her brother, Paul (Malcolm "A Clockwork Orange" McDowell). What she discovers is ultimately not to her liking, as it turns out she can never consummate a love affair without turning into a big cat and then killing someone (typically the lover) in order to revert to human form. Unless she sticks with incest. Bummer for her. Despite decent critical reception, "Cat People" tanked at the box office, possibly from an ill-timed release date, early spring not being the ideal time for a slick exploitation horror film, no matter its pedigree, and never mind its perversity. It has since maintained a healthy reputation on video, for good reasons: choice nudity, ample gore, flashes of humor ("Top Cat"), and a compelling story with very few "oh, c'mons" that trades on unsettling fears of and fascinations with female empowerment. If I have any real complaints storywise, they would center on the somewhat murky parameters of the transformation from human to big cat (is it volitional, are there specific triggers?) as well as certain questions concerning Irena's ultimate willingness to suffer a submissive fate. But these are small quibbles that don't seriously impinge upon the core story. Kinski and McDowell sell their characters beautifully, while John "Home Alone" Heard and Annette "Smallville" O'Toole are strong foils heading up a support cast that includes Ruby "The Stand" Dee and Schrader favorite Ed "St. Elsewhere" Begley, Jr. Eminently entertaining (and no doubt multiply so for Kinski and/or O'Toole droolers), "Cat People" is near the top of my list of horror movies that might actually deserve another retelling with the right actors and an improved script. Still, Schrader's version is certainly recommended to genre fans everywhere.

    I enjoyed "Cat People" especially for it's interesting beginning and hope for a strong movie. It definitely shows it's age in effects, settings, and most especially music that on the whole I didn't care for. And although not a werewolf tale, people will certainly compare the 2 ideas. (spoilers) Some of the aspects of the movie I liked were the constraints of the fable, and while the character development was a bit mishandled mostly seriously in the way she does a reverse 180 after her brother dies, I liked the movie leading up to that point. The ending is mostly a compromise that makes sense for Kinski's character, but seems sort of too safe. Was hoping there'd be more "Cat People" involved in the story, and a bit more history and development as opposed to violence. Anyway, this is a fair movie and fairy-tale if you can look past it's aging that shows up.

    The original Cat People is considered to be a masterpiece. A masterpiece that sometimes doesn't get as much attention as it should, but still holds a positive view among people. The story is about a woman named Irena who falls for and marries a man named Oliver Reed (no relation to the actor and it's a different last name in the remake). The only problem is Irena believes an old curse upon her people from her native country will turn her into a panther if she gets too upset or displays her love in any physical way. While she's getting therapy Oliver finds out he's actually in love with his co-worker Alice and plans to divorce Irena and the result isn't very pretty. The film was given to Val Lewton to produce with a low budget and no real story behind it. But with a little imagination a lot can be achieved. It specializes for fear of the unseen and psychological messages. We don't know at first whether Irena's really able to change or just crazy at first. The film keeps you guessing with some great build-up and developed characters and some truly suspenseful scenes when Irena decides to follow Alice around. The sequel isn't half bad either showing us a somewhat troubled child and mixing reality and fantasy so well it was shown in college psychology classes. Now the remake is pretty much the same story but with some differences. You see a lot more this time and instead of a psychological tone it takes a sexual tone. Irena now has a brother who like her is one of the Cat People. Instead of Cat People being supposed witches in the myths Irena believed in the original their explained to be the result of children being sacrificed so much to the panthers they become them and can only have safe sex if it's with one another. Her brother desperately craving a passionate yet safe experience stalks her while in the meantime she learns about her dilemma and falls for Oliver. Nastassja Kinski plays a good Irena and while not quite as pitiful as Simone Simon's can still be felt for and Oliver too. The real star is Malcolm McDowell as the brother. He's so creepy and yet somewhat sympathetic too. He's so desperate for a woman to be with who he won't kill he's willing to go as far as mate with his sister. There's a lot of nice visuals and set designs, great lighting many more scenes with the panthers creating a bigger body count as a result. It sort of reminds one of American Werewolf in London at first with the transformations, but there's enough originality to make it it's own movie. The music is great too and features David Bowie doing a short yet haunting song and Paul Schrader's direction is great too. What the remake falls short in is it's ability to reflect the original effectively. Some time in the last third or so it tries to imitate the remake in having Irena stalk Alice in almost entirely the same way though with the pool scene a bit more darkly lit than the original by the look of it making it easier for a panther to hide from the camera. However Alice isn't really with Oliver in the movie (she only wishes they were for the most part) and having done so much to make it it's own movie I feel the times it tries to be a remake almost take away from the plot than add to it this time. I love when a remake can be original and still follow the original, but this time since the psychological and horror tones are decreased for a more sexual and visionary style it makes those scenes almost seem like a completely different movie and makes Irena's motives seem more cruel to Alice than defensive about her relationship. It's as if the movie was meant to be filmed completely differently at first and they decided halfway through filming they should include the stalking scenes even though they not only feel out of place but are never mentioned after wards. It's pacing seems to vary at times too. Overall Cat People is a decent film. Not a masterpiece and not really recommended for those demanding an accurate remake with the same style. Those who just want to see Kinski naked in several scenes and plenty of panther scenes complete with gore and all may feel satisfied. It all depends on taste.

    If nothing else, I'll probably remember Cat People, for its award winning theme from David Bowie, recently reincarnated for Inglorious Basterds, but the movie has a few other things going for it. At first glance it resembles An American Werewolf in London, without the humour, but from a 21st century perspective it reminds me even more of Candyman, which had yet to be adapted for film. Clive Barker's story was more inventive, and the film was scarier, but Cat People (remake or not) is pretty evocative as well. It's not as cheap as it may sound. The animals here are real. If anything Cat People has a bit of a throwback attitude to a time when monsters were sexy, (or some monsters at least). After vampires, cats may be the next most seductive of creatures. So Cat People has a few things going for it, but some things it has too much of. The film is so focused on style, and generally low tones, that it comes at the cost of believable story. The first half is not bad, but the second half feels sort of muddled and confused, not to mention anticlimactic. I like the way the movie ends though, one of those neither happy nor sad finales. So Cat People I suppose is a good movie for the monster fans. It is certainly not as cheap as many others, but its lack of story is somewhat degrading.

    This is one of the most erotic horror films I have ever seen. Cat people who mate with their own kind is typical, but suppose one of them decides to go outside her kind and just want to find romance and not save her species from extinction. The two cat people are orphans and they want to mate with each other because there are no others around. Irena(Nastassja Kinski) and brother Paul(Malcom McDowell) are the last of the breed who follows the way of their kind. Paul on the other hand venture on the hunt and is later found in the city zoo. in panther mode. Irena finds a human mate, and is smitten by him. The brother disapproves, and decides to have him killed. Well he did kill one of the keepers in the zoo by tearing off him arm and he bleeds to death. He really did more damage when he called up a call girl and and attacked her in cat mode. This movie has a lot to go by, the erotica, the mood, the intensity, and the humor this movie got to offer. It's a real keeper in my book. Tired of werewolves or vampires? "Cat People" is for you! 4 out of 5 stars!
