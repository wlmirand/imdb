    I loved this book when I was growing up in the sixties, and I was thrilled when I found out that they made a movie out of it, but didn't get around to seeing it until last night. At first, I thought it was going to be one of those disappointing, modernized versions, mostly because of the distracting musical score, but despite the truly annoying score, the movie remained true to the book except for a few minor details. Even the toys depicted were from the era that the book was written in. I think that's so important when making a movie out of a children's book. The story is brilliant, about a little girl who wants to be a writer, so she gets her practice by keeping a notebook in which she writes down all her thoughts and observations about the people in her world, and even goes to the extreme of spying on people to get her material. When the notebook falls into the wrong hands, her world is turned upside down. I think the film does a very good job of portraying the children in a realistic light, and I could identify with Harriet's feelings as well as those of her friends and classmates. The adults in the movie, as well as Harriet's nemesis, seemed a bit like caricatures, but Harriet's character and those of her best friends were quite well developed. Definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of this book.

    A writer while describing the life and work of John Le Carr&eacute; said this: "Writer and spy are two lonely professions, carried of emotions and both are developed under a certain load of tension". Nothing is more adequate than such quote when the analyzed person is the great Le Carr&eacute;, author of treasures like "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy", "Smiley's People" among many other espionage novels. The same can't be said to the main character of "Harriet the Spy" neither about the story, that almost reached such description (and it could have been way better). So, little Harriet (Michelle Trachtenberg) wants to be a writer and for such she pretends to be like a spy who sees everything, writing down all the things she sees, from random and somewhat pointless happenings to making truthful remarks about her friends and school mates. But when her diary is stolen by her most ferocious enemy things can turn out to be real bad for her if such descriptions be known to everyone she knows. A cute movie, nice to watch but that doesn't help us much. Fine, this a movie for kids and for them is prefect, very enjoyable, but those kind of flicks work better if they attract mature audiences as well, even if using two or three jokes for them. The cast assembled here with names like Trachtenberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Robert Joy and Gregory Smith makes of "Harriet the Spy" quite a good film, and we can excuse some of its problems. The main focus that a good writer is made with observations and notes only isn't much handy (as Harriet discovers). Above all, and I can't believe this was left out of the movie, a good writer must be a great reader of all sources and different types of readings, must have a background of readings. And if I'm making too much fuzz over a kid's movie, too much complications, is because is that I wanted to see an intelligent work, with this kind of plot but in a dramatic way, with lots of suspense, a teenager who wants to be a writer but gets involved with more and more trouble while covering a story. Instead, we have an emo tale filled with corny moments. But that's OK. 6/10

    I still remember coming out of the theater when I was about 8 years old. My father was really surprised by how cruel the children in the film were and he asked me if that's actually how it is. I was more surprised by his reaction than by anything else. Yes, adults need to stop thinking childhood is all about happiness. Personally, it got me to write. At the time I saw this film I had gotten into writing fiction at about age 6. This actually gave me the idea to start journal writing and I have yet to stop at age 22. The way Harriet resolves things with her friends is a bit quick, but I think it's because the other kids become hypocrites. During my college Children's Lit class, we discussed this book and how Harriet is attacked because her thoughts become public. Everyone thinks negative thoughts about everyone else -- It shouldn't make her the target. Self expression is very important to everyone, I think that is a big part of what the story and film are about. Her writing and exploration of the society around her is just like any other child's. She just goes about it more directly.

    While not as zippily paced as the book, and the film can get predictable and a tad corny, it is entertaining thanks to the spirited acting and the enthusiasm that shapes this movie. The script is well written and quite mature and funny, and the premise about a girl who spies on her friends and family and writes about them in her notebook, is a nice one. The direction is good, the tone of the film is quirky and the performances are great. Michelle Trachtenberg is perfectly cast as Harriet, Trachtenberg was a very promising child actress and this is proof of that. Eartha Kitt is great as Agatha, and Gregory Smith and Vanessa Lee Chester both give spirited turns as Sport and Janie. As Harriet's nanny, Rosie O'Donnell is a really pleasant surprise. Here she gives a very warm performance, and I do think she was better than she was in The Flintstones, where I did like her but she didn't quite have the voluptuousness of her character Betty. The film is well shot, with a nice soundtrack. Overall, not perfect, but definitely worth watching. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    I grew up being forced to watch this film, quite simply because my siblings adored it and I ended up having to watch it with them whether I like it or not. Now the story is simple and straight foreward- a young girl spies on other people and writes about their flaws in a notebook she carries with her everywhere but her fun in spying is soon foiled when the other kids read the notebook and thus begin to lash out onto her. The class gets their revenge on her and she gets revenge back and she ends up apologizing for her actions. Even when I was like eight or nine when I first saw the film, I never felt bad for Harriet. Why? Simply because this definitely was not a victim-less situation where "oh, poor Harriet everyone is picking on her; let's pity her!" comes to mind. Heck no, in fact I ended up feeling more sorry for some of the people she got back at. Sure, the bullies were harsh but what she did was over the line. I didn't even feel sorry for her in the first place because she had it coming the entire time that she was spying, writing notes in her book and writing rather negative conclusions about other people. Had it not been for her "greater than thou" attitude, I would have appreciated the story a lot better. Speaking of her "greater than thou" attitude, am I the only one who was always bothered by her revenge scene? She simply could've been the bigger person to actually realize that her nosey habits and attitude were the problem, not just other people. However, no, we follow a rather immature brat who instead of taking responsibility goes as far as using verbal abuse and cutting off someone's long braid off for her own petty "revenge"; even though she was asking for it the moment she chose to bring the book everywhere. 2/10

    "Harriet the Spy" has to be one of Nickelodeon's greatest movies ever created! Michelle Trachtenberg was flawless in her role as Harriet M. Welsch as she displays such emotion and energy, that her acting made Harriet a very likable character. I love the way that Harriet is spunky and eager to learn more about life and that just makes me love her character more. I also love Rosie O'Donnell's role in this movie as she acts as Harriet's guide to learning more about life by encouraging her to write about what she sees out in the open. The scenes where Harriet is tortured by her classmates because she wrote some nasty things about them, is both intense and realistic as we actually see Harriet suffering from losing her two best friends and how she ends up distrusting everyone around her. "Harriet the Spy" is definitely one of Nickelodeon's classics that can't be forgotten for a long time.

    After seeing this movie, Harriet the Spy, I have to admit it was something. Harriet spies a lot, writes down what she learns and observe, and wants to be something in life. Too bad her friends snooped in her notebook and she got exposed. I felt bad for her after everybody found out her private thoughts and hated her for it. Sometimes kids can be relentless. I felt worse when the kids became spy catchers and interfered with her spying, including her own friends Sport and Janie. I also cannot believe they went and got blue paint all over her. I knew after that bitch Marion poured paint in her hair and got slapped in the face for it, that was going to be it. Harriet wasn't lying when she told them she was going to get them real bad, and she did. As I watched her get back at the kids that did cruel things to her, I was cracking up, especially when Laura got nailed by an unexpected haircut. Too bad for Beth's pictures she posted. Harriet vandalized them. Time to throw them away. When Carrie was looking for her bra, it wasn't pretty when she realized that bra Harriet put on a pole was hers. And look how bad Pinky and Janie's projects turned out after Harriet tampered with them. Mostly, I felt worse for Marion and Sport when Harriet said something false about her father to Marion to make her cry like crazy and when Harriet humiliated Sport in front of the whole school by posting an embarrassing picture of him. He was so broken hearted. that was going way too far and was really low even for her. Not just her, all of them. Well, I am glad Harriet's nanny, Golly, gave her advice on what to do. I am even more glad everybody forgave her and left that club Marion and Rachel invented. Besides, even though Marion may have edited the newspaper for 3 years, her writing wasn't as good. She just threw in something and got credit for it. But Harriet knows what she is talking about as the editor of the newspaper now. People are interested and they aren't laughing. You know why? Because it all makes sense. The kids get the point. Harriet had details that made sense. Marion just threw in anything, just so she could get what she wanted. That girl acted like a brat when Harriet suggested it was time to change the person who's editor. She learned that it always doesn't have to be about her, especially at the pageant. Her dancing was all right, but boring. Harriet and her friends fast and active dancing was awesome. Plus, kids really got their groove on when they were limboing on stage, especially Marion, Harriet and her friends. Also, I am relieved that Harriet got back to her spy route after she was forgiven. She is to do what she does best again and put it in article form for the newspaper.

    If I had seen this movie on its own, I would probably have no strong opinion of it. I can see how children would like it, and it's not "bad" in and of itself. However, as an adaptation of my favorite book from childhood, it's very disappointing, and that's why I rate it as I do. Perhaps "Harriet the Spy" was never suited for updating to the late 20th century. And it's a difficult thing to adapt to film, since so much of the text takes place inside Harriet's head and in the pages of her notebook. This book and I are about the same age and I'd like to see it done again as a period piece, with more attention paid to casting and less to the swirly 1990's camera work. It's simple: look at the author's illustrations in the book, and find actors who look like that. Eartha Kitt can be wonderful, but she's no Agatha Plummer what about Angela Lansbury? Or Rue McClanahan? The worst choice of all was Rosie O'Donnell as Ole Golly. (To indulge in a little fantasy casting, I'd love to have seen the late Nancy Kulp as Ole Golly; I think she would have done a wonderful job.) Oh well. It is what it is, and your mileage will vary. I don't think Louise Fitzhugh would have been pleased, and I know I wasn't.

    I saw this movie with my dad when it came out in the theaters -AHHH! IT CAME OUT IN IN 1996!!! I FEEL SO OLD!!-...ahem-sorry, my age just slapped me in the face. Anywho, we were watching the movie and the movie went out just as Harriett was taking out all her supplies from various places, and I remember telling my dad, "Maybe they don't want us to know where she keeps her things." The reason I bring up that random memory is because I remember it. I was so entranced by it, I remember saying that. I use to love this movie. The movie use to depress me, though, as Harriet loves all her friends thanks to her spying. Anyway, the acting is OK. Granted, it's no "Shakespeare in love", but it's OK. The story is also very out there, however, that's not fair for me to say, as I can't remember the storyline!

    I love this movie. It is just so much fun. Michelle Trachtenberg was so adorable as Harriet M. Welsch, the little kid detective. Watch this with your kids, parents. It is so funny! I highly recommend this movie to everybody. Everyone will love it. Especially the kids. It teaches them a good lesson. It taught me one when I was little. The plot is so silly but so fun that it makes the movie so fun. I loved watching it when I was little. Me being older now, 15, makes me a little less into it but I still adore this and I watch it with my little cousin Lydia every Thanksgiving. She loves it as much as I do. Watch this movie. It's so awesome!

    If I had seen this movie on its own, I would probably have no strong opinion of it. I can see how children would like it, and it's not "bad" in and of itself. However, as an adaptation of my favorite book from childhood, it's very disappointing, and that's why I rate it as I do. Perhaps "Harriet the Spy" was never suited for updating to the late 20th century. And it's a difficult thing to adapt to film, since so much of the text takes place inside Harriet's head and in the pages of her notebook. This book and I are about the same age and I'd like to see it done again as a period piece, with more attention paid to casting and less to the swirly 1990's camera work. It's simple: look at the author's illustrations in the book, and find actors who look like that. Eartha Kitt can be wonderful, but she's no Agatha Plummer what about Angela Lansbury? Or Rue McClanahan? The worst choice of all was Rosie O'Donnell as Ole Golly. (To indulge in a little fantasy casting, I'd love to have seen the late Nancy Kulp as Ole Golly; I think she would have done a wonderful job.) Oh well. It is what it is, and your mileage will vary. I don't think Louise Fitzhugh would have been pleased, and I know I wasn't.

    I saw this movie with my dad when it came out in the theaters -AHHH! IT CAME OUT IN IN 1996!!! I FEEL SO OLD!!-...ahem-sorry, my age just slapped me in the face. Anywho, we were watching the movie and the movie went out just as Harriett was taking out all her supplies from various places, and I remember telling my dad, "Maybe they don't want us to know where she keeps her things." The reason I bring up that random memory is because I remember it. I was so entranced by it, I remember saying that. I use to love this movie. The movie use to depress me, though, as Harriet loves all her friends thanks to her spying. Anyway, the acting is OK. Granted, it's no "Shakespeare in love", but it's OK. The story is also very out there, however, that's not fair for me to say, as I can't remember the storyline!

    I love this movie. It is just so much fun. Michelle Trachtenberg was so adorable as Harriet M. Welsch, the little kid detective. Watch this with your kids, parents. It is so funny! I highly recommend this movie to everybody. Everyone will love it. Especially the kids. It teaches them a good lesson. It taught me one when I was little. The plot is so silly but so fun that it makes the movie so fun. I loved watching it when I was little. Me being older now, 15, makes me a little less into it but I still adore this and I watch it with my little cousin Lydia every Thanksgiving. She loves it as much as I do. Watch this movie. It's so awesome!

    I loved this book when I was growing up in the sixties, and I was thrilled when I found out that they made a movie out of it, but didn't get around to seeing it until last night. At first, I thought it was going to be one of those disappointing, modernized versions, mostly because of the distracting musical score, but despite the truly annoying score, the movie remained true to the book except for a few minor details. Even the toys depicted were from the era that the book was written in. I think that's so important when making a movie out of a children's book. The story is brilliant, about a little girl who wants to be a writer, so she gets her practice by keeping a notebook in which she writes down all her thoughts and observations about the people in her world, and even goes to the extreme of spying on people to get her material. When the notebook falls into the wrong hands, her world is turned upside down. I think the film does a very good job of portraying the children in a realistic light, and I could identify with Harriet's feelings as well as those of her friends and classmates. The adults in the movie, as well as Harriet's nemesis, seemed a bit like caricatures, but Harriet's character and those of her best friends were quite well developed. Definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of this book.

    A writer while describing the life and work of John Le Carr&eacute; said this: "Writer and spy are two lonely professions, carried of emotions and both are developed under a certain load of tension". Nothing is more adequate than such quote when the analyzed person is the great Le Carr&eacute;, author of treasures like "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy", "Smiley's People" among many other espionage novels. The same can't be said to the main character of "Harriet the Spy" neither about the story, that almost reached such description (and it could have been way better). So, little Harriet (Michelle Trachtenberg) wants to be a writer and for such she pretends to be like a spy who sees everything, writing down all the things she sees, from random and somewhat pointless happenings to making truthful remarks about her friends and school mates. But when her diary is stolen by her most ferocious enemy things can turn out to be real bad for her if such descriptions be known to everyone she knows. A cute movie, nice to watch but that doesn't help us much. Fine, this a movie for kids and for them is prefect, very enjoyable, but those kind of flicks work better if they attract mature audiences as well, even if using two or three jokes for them. The cast assembled here with names like Trachtenberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Robert Joy and Gregory Smith makes of "Harriet the Spy" quite a good film, and we can excuse some of its problems. The main focus that a good writer is made with observations and notes only isn't much handy (as Harriet discovers). Above all, and I can't believe this was left out of the movie, a good writer must be a great reader of all sources and different types of readings, must have a background of readings. And if I'm making too much fuzz over a kid's movie, too much complications, is because is that I wanted to see an intelligent work, with this kind of plot but in a dramatic way, with lots of suspense, a teenager who wants to be a writer but gets involved with more and more trouble while covering a story. Instead, we have an emo tale filled with corny moments. But that's OK. 6/10

    I still remember coming out of the theater when I was about 8 years old. My father was really surprised by how cruel the children in the film were and he asked me if that's actually how it is. I was more surprised by his reaction than by anything else. Yes, adults need to stop thinking childhood is all about happiness. Personally, it got me to write. At the time I saw this film I had gotten into writing fiction at about age 6. This actually gave me the idea to start journal writing and I have yet to stop at age 22. The way Harriet resolves things with her friends is a bit quick, but I think it's because the other kids become hypocrites. During my college Children's Lit class, we discussed this book and how Harriet is attacked because her thoughts become public. Everyone thinks negative thoughts about everyone else -- It shouldn't make her the target. Self expression is very important to everyone, I think that is a big part of what the story and film are about. Her writing and exploration of the society around her is just like any other child's. She just goes about it more directly.

    While not as zippily paced as the book, and the film can get predictable and a tad corny, it is entertaining thanks to the spirited acting and the enthusiasm that shapes this movie. The script is well written and quite mature and funny, and the premise about a girl who spies on her friends and family and writes about them in her notebook, is a nice one. The direction is good, the tone of the film is quirky and the performances are great. Michelle Trachtenberg is perfectly cast as Harriet, Trachtenberg was a very promising child actress and this is proof of that. Eartha Kitt is great as Agatha, and Gregory Smith and Vanessa Lee Chester both give spirited turns as Sport and Janie. As Harriet's nanny, Rosie O'Donnell is a really pleasant surprise. Here she gives a very warm performance, and I do think she was better than she was in The Flintstones, where I did like her but she didn't quite have the voluptuousness of her character Betty. The film is well shot, with a nice soundtrack. Overall, not perfect, but definitely worth watching. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    I grew up being forced to watch this film, quite simply because my siblings adored it and I ended up having to watch it with them whether I like it or not. Now the story is simple and straight foreward- a young girl spies on other people and writes about their flaws in a notebook she carries with her everywhere but her fun in spying is soon foiled when the other kids read the notebook and thus begin to lash out onto her. The class gets their revenge on her and she gets revenge back and she ends up apologizing for her actions. Even when I was like eight or nine when I first saw the film, I never felt bad for Harriet. Why? Simply because this definitely was not a victim-less situation where "oh, poor Harriet everyone is picking on her; let's pity her!" comes to mind. Heck no, in fact I ended up feeling more sorry for some of the people she got back at. Sure, the bullies were harsh but what she did was over the line. I didn't even feel sorry for her in the first place because she had it coming the entire time that she was spying, writing notes in her book and writing rather negative conclusions about other people. Had it not been for her "greater than thou" attitude, I would have appreciated the story a lot better. Speaking of her "greater than thou" attitude, am I the only one who was always bothered by her revenge scene? She simply could've been the bigger person to actually realize that her nosey habits and attitude were the problem, not just other people. However, no, we follow a rather immature brat who instead of taking responsibility goes as far as using verbal abuse and cutting off someone's long braid off for her own petty "revenge"; even though she was asking for it the moment she chose to bring the book everywhere. 2/10

    "Harriet the Spy" has to be one of Nickelodeon's greatest movies ever created! Michelle Trachtenberg was flawless in her role as Harriet M. Welsch as she displays such emotion and energy, that her acting made Harriet a very likable character. I love the way that Harriet is spunky and eager to learn more about life and that just makes me love her character more. I also love Rosie O'Donnell's role in this movie as she acts as Harriet's guide to learning more about life by encouraging her to write about what she sees out in the open. The scenes where Harriet is tortured by her classmates because she wrote some nasty things about them, is both intense and realistic as we actually see Harriet suffering from losing her two best friends and how she ends up distrusting everyone around her. "Harriet the Spy" is definitely one of Nickelodeon's classics that can't be forgotten for a long time.

    After seeing this movie, Harriet the Spy, I have to admit it was something. Harriet spies a lot, writes down what she learns and observe, and wants to be something in life. Too bad her friends snooped in her notebook and she got exposed. I felt bad for her after everybody found out her private thoughts and hated her for it. Sometimes kids can be relentless. I felt worse when the kids became spy catchers and interfered with her spying, including her own friends Sport and Janie. I also cannot believe they went and got blue paint all over her. I knew after that bitch Marion poured paint in her hair and got slapped in the face for it, that was going to be it. Harriet wasn't lying when she told them she was going to get them real bad, and she did. As I watched her get back at the kids that did cruel things to her, I was cracking up, especially when Laura got nailed by an unexpected haircut. Too bad for Beth's pictures she posted. Harriet vandalized them. Time to throw them away. When Carrie was looking for her bra, it wasn't pretty when she realized that bra Harriet put on a pole was hers. And look how bad Pinky and Janie's projects turned out after Harriet tampered with them. Mostly, I felt worse for Marion and Sport when Harriet said something false about her father to Marion to make her cry like crazy and when Harriet humiliated Sport in front of the whole school by posting an embarrassing picture of him. He was so broken hearted. that was going way too far and was really low even for her. Not just her, all of them. Well, I am glad Harriet's nanny, Golly, gave her advice on what to do. I am even more glad everybody forgave her and left that club Marion and Rachel invented. Besides, even though Marion may have edited the newspaper for 3 years, her writing wasn't as good. She just threw in something and got credit for it. But Harriet knows what she is talking about as the editor of the newspaper now. People are interested and they aren't laughing. You know why? Because it all makes sense. The kids get the point. Harriet had details that made sense. Marion just threw in anything, just so she could get what she wanted. That girl acted like a brat when Harriet suggested it was time to change the person who's editor. She learned that it always doesn't have to be about her, especially at the pageant. Her dancing was all right, but boring. Harriet and her friends fast and active dancing was awesome. Plus, kids really got their groove on when they were limboing on stage, especially Marion, Harriet and her friends. Also, I am relieved that Harriet got back to her spy route after she was forgiven. She is to do what she does best again and put it in article form for the newspaper.

Or Rue McClanahan? The worst choice of all was Rosie O'Donnell as Ole Golly. (To indulge in a little fantasy casting, I'd love to have seen the late Nancy Kulp as Ole Golly; I think she would have done a wonderful job.) Oh well. It is what it is, and your mileage will vary. I don't think Louise Fitzhugh would have been pleased, and I know I wasn't.

Mostly, I felt worse for Marion and Sport when Harriet said something false about her father to Marion to make her cry like crazy and when Harriet humiliated Sport in front of the whole school by posting an embarrassing picture of him. He was so broken hearted. that was going way too far and was really low even for her. Not just her, all of them. Well, I am glad Harriet's nanny, Golly, gave her advice on what to do. I am even more glad everybody forgave her and left that club Marion and Rachel invented. Besides, even though Marion may have edited the newspaper for 3 years, her writing wasn't as good. She just threw in something and got credit for it. But Harriet knows what she is talking about as the editor of the newspaper now. People are interested and they aren't laughing. You know why? Because it all makes sense. The kids get the point. Harriet had details that made sense. Marion just threw in anything, just so she could get what she wanted. That girl acted like a brat when Harriet suggested it was time to change the person who's editor. She learned that it always doesn't have to be about her, especially at the pageant. Her dancing was all right, but boring. Harriet and her friends fast and active dancing was awesome. Plus, kids really got their groove on when they were limboing on stage, especially Marion, Harriet and her friends. Also, I am relieved that Harriet got back to her spy route after she was forgiven. She is to do what she does best again and put it in article form for the newspaper.

    If I had seen this movie on its own, I would probably have no strong opinion of it. I can see how children would like it, and it's not "bad" in and of itself. However, as an adaptation of my favorite book from childhood, it's very disappointing, and that's why I rate it as I do. Perhaps "Harriet the Spy" was never suited for updating to the late 20th century. And it's a difficult thing to adapt to film, since so much of the text takes place inside Harriet's head and in the pages of her notebook. This book and I are about the same age and I'd like to see it done again as a period piece, with more attention paid to casting and less to the swirly 1990's camera work. It's simple: look at the author's illustrations in the book, and find actors who look like that. Eartha Kitt can be wonderful, but she's no Agatha Plummer what about Angela Lansbury? Or Rue McClanahan? The worst choice of all was Rosie O'Donnell as Ole Golly. (To indulge in a little fantasy casting, I'd love to have seen the late Nancy Kulp as Ole Golly; I think she would have done a wonderful job.) Oh well. It is what it is, and your mileage will vary. I don't think Louise Fitzhugh would have been pleased, and I know I wasn't.

    I saw this movie with my dad when it came out in the theaters -AHHH! IT CAME OUT IN IN 1996!!! I FEEL SO OLD!!-...ahem-sorry, my age just slapped me in the face. Anywho, we were watching the movie and the movie went out just as Harriett was taking out all her supplies from various places, and I remember telling my dad, "Maybe they don't want us to know where she keeps her things." The reason I bring up that random memory is because I remember it. I was so entranced by it, I remember saying that. I use to love this movie. The movie use to depress me, though, as Harriet loves all her friends thanks to her spying. Anyway, the acting is OK. Granted, it's no "Shakespeare in love", but it's OK. The story is also very out there, however, that's not fair for me to say, as I can't remember the storyline!

    I love this movie. It is just so much fun. Michelle Trachtenberg was so adorable as Harriet M. Welsch, the little kid detective. Watch this with your kids, parents. It is so funny! I highly recommend this movie to everybody. Everyone will love it. Especially the kids. It teaches them a good lesson. It taught me one when I was little. The plot is so silly but so fun that it makes the movie so fun. I loved watching it when I was little. Me being older now, 15, makes me a little less into it but I still adore this and I watch it with my little cousin Lydia every Thanksgiving. She loves it as much as I do. Watch this movie. It's so awesome!
