    I think the biggest problem with this film is that it has some great people in it. Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and Rob Reiner. It could of been great, but no. There is only one joke in this film that I laughed at. Others either didn't make sense or just were not funny. The casting is terrible for the most part, the characters are nasty, the plot is stupid and the writing is strange. Wood, along with Graham Greene, Abe Vigoda and Matthew McCurly, do give us a nice performance, but that certainly does not make the film worth watching at all. It is terrible. It does not deserve to be watched. You should skip buying this film, unless you really want to see how bad it is.

    The film North (which was released on July 22, 1994) features a comedy-drama-adventure plot written by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman and directed by Rob Reiner. The story is based on the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel. North was Rob Reiner's first recent family-friendly movie. Rob Reiner also directed the greats such as "This is Spinal Tap (1984)", "Misery (1990)", and "A Few Good Men (1992)". The film stars a talented then 13-year old actor Elijah Wood as the main protagonist, North. At the time the film was released in 1994, Elijah Wood was starting to become a somewhat well known celebrity. The film also stars Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, and Abe Vigoda. It is also Scarlett Johansson's debut film, who's gone on to be considered one of the sexiest actresses of our era . North (Elijah Wood) is a eleven year old kid, with busy parents (Julia Louis Dreyfus & Jason Alexander) not giving him the attention he needs. So, North and his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz) file a lawsuit against them. The judge played by Alan Arkin decides that North should either find new parents or return to his own parents by Labor Day  a deadline of two months. If he hasn't found new parents or returned to his by the deadline, he will be sent to an orphanage. So North sets out traveling the world in search of parents who really care about him. His first stop is Texas where he takes a shot at getting to know potentially new parents played by Dan Aykroyd & Reba McEntire. That doesn't work out very well and he moves on to Hawaii and Alaska where he meets an Eskimo mother played by Oscar-winning movie actress Kathy Bates. The parents he encounters in the movie aren't funny, although they aren't serious and turn out not to be helpful to North. Either way, I believe the actors in the movie don't play their characters in the humorous way needed. The film is narrated by Bruce Willis in the form of a mysterious characters who follows North throughout the movie in various character forms - the Easter bunny, a Texan cowboy, a beach bum and a Fed-Ex driver. The narrator first meets North at a mall wearing an Easter bunny costume a role difficult to reconcile with Willis' usual tough-guy role. His role as narrator in the film really falls short. The narrator, in my mind, is not helpful to the movie. One example of this is the way that the narrator verbalizes to North about his terrible parents. Rob Reiner's biggest mistake as a film director takes place with creation of this motion picture, a mistake he himself acknowledged: "North is one of the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life!". I feel sorry for Rob Reiner with respect to his directing of this film, but he, of course, was unaware while directing the film that it would turn out as bad as it did and he probably shouldn't have even made the film whose greatest weakness is the screenplay and film production itself. (Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman also produced the film.) The film North has one of the stupidest stories ever and I disliked every character portrayed in the movie. Even the film was really poor, I still respect Rob Reiner because it is his only failure of a movie; the only truly bad film he's ever directed. Here's my advice: "Do not watch this film! However, you could watch it just to see how bad the movie truly is!" I give that film a 0 out of 4 stars!

    I have difficulty in understanding the low rating given by other reviewers (unless the absence of violence, gratuitous sex and profanity deserves low rating with some reviewers). While it may not be an Academy Award winning candidate, it is really a fun, entertaining and movie which my wife and I found to be hilarious! Good, clean, entertaining movies which are enjoyable for the whole family are all too rare. Unless you like profanity, violence and sex in a movie I highly recommend this for the whole family. We had no idea what it was about, but got "hooked" on it after the first few minutes and enjoyed watching it to the end. It has an excellent cast, and all performed well.

    I'll admit, I'm a fan and a connoisseur of bad movies, and I only watched this because I read Ebert's famous "hated, hated, hated" review. I figured anything that bad had to be at least interesting. Unfortunately, Ebert's review is far more memorable than the movie itself, and probably gave it a lot more attention than it deserved. The movie isn't bad in any really notable or entertaining way, just lame, annoying, and ultimately forgettable. It poses an interesting question; namely, what makes one movie "quirky and charming" and another - well, this? After all, some of the best movies by people like the Coen Brothers or Wes Anderson have fantastical characters and plot elements, and are occasionally mean- spirited. In contrast, this movie falls flat at every turn. There's not a *single* funny line or likable character, but the quality of the acting and production is high enough that it even fails to be "so bad it's good". Oddly, I think the movie it reminded of most was Myra Breckinridge. Both movies are similarly colorful, surreal, remarkably star-studded, completely unfunny, and genuinely unpleasant to watch. Of course, unlike Myra Breckinridge, this was supposed to be a kids' movie! It's lucky that Rob Reiner has so many other great movie to his credit, and generally comes across as a likable guy. Not everyone would be forgiven for this.

    "North" is probably the most hateful movie I've seen in an extremely long time. With a god-awful script with extremely tasteless dialogue, a stupid plot and wasting the perfectly good talent of Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and it's director Rob Reiner (A Few Good Men, The Princess Bride, Misery, When Harry Met Sally, etc.). This movie even makes me cringe when I'm sitting her writing this review A boy (Elijah Wood) gets fed up with his folks and decides to divorce them and go looking for a new set of parents, like Texans (Reba McEntire and Dan Aykroyd), Hawaiians, Eskimos (Kathy Bates, Abe Vigoda) Amish, etc. Everything in this film is UNBELIEVABLY bad! This is a very, very, very, very bad movie. Just like the great Roger Ebert, I hated this movie! I think Elijah Wood is a good actor, and the director Rob Reiner has made one terrific movie after another, but this is garbage. First class garbage!!! I'm sorry, but this sucked!!!

    North (Elijah Wood), a bright and talented eleven year old boy (or so we're told) who clearly never had to go hungry but whose parents are so preoccupied with their career that they don't let him speak at the dinner table to dispense the wisdom his many gifts have bequeathed him (speaking of child-abuse), decide to "divorce" them and find himself a new set of parents more appreciative of his talents. Consequently, he meets a bunch of wannabe quirky characters who all desperately want to adopt him and is being helped along the way by his "guardian angel" (Bruce Willis). I've never really been one to join in on a mob. Crowds generally make me nervous and I usually regard any gathering of any kind with a healthy dose of suspicion. So jumping into any bandwagon just isn't me. Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of "North", the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record, his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could "North" be? Or more accurately put: how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like? Well... "North" is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults, the "philosophical" narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with off-colour jokes and somewhat waspish clich&eacute;s that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where "North" really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work, the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass (the Hawaiian episode springs to mind, in that respect). Of course, one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place (like any other Rob Reiner film) and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that "North" is never funny (which in itself is pure torture for a so-called comedy) but offensive and ultimately mean-spirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects, going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters, the main villain here chief suspect among these, deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life. I so wanted to like this film, if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone, which I admit is rather obnoxious of me. But I simply can't and must add my voice to the sound of the crowd as the song goes. Is "North" the worse film ever made? Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse. But somehow, thinking of it I feel like punching something. So that can't be good...

    North is a story about a kid with a strange name played by pre-Frodo Elijah Wood who thinks mommy and daddy didn't get him enough ice cream and goes to find new ones. That's it. That's the premise of the movie. North's parents are loving but busy despite him being a child prodigy, all the other parents love him, giving us more reason to despise him (and the other kids too I would guess, and rightly so). He takes the advice of Bruce Willis in a rabbit costume, and 'divorces' his parents at the behest of a judge who looks more like a hobo disguised as a judge. North then goes around to strange parodies of parents around the world, including Oklahoma-style parents, some Hawaiians who establish a disgustingly borderline paedophilic poster of him, Eskimoes, Africans, Chinese where they worship him as a God (strange in a communist country), and a Walton-esque clich&eacute; family who seem perfect, but the spoilt little snot-face is still unhappy and abandons them, visits the Amish, the French, and due to some implausible plot line with his former friend, has to return to his parents in the right time without getting killed, only to wake up to discover it was all a dream and he returns home. Not only is this film unfunny, insulting, patronising and stupid, it breaks the one rule of writing. Making the story a dream by the end without making this clear at the start is the worst thing a writer can do. Rob Reiner's career never recovered, but considering he thought pre-teen Elijah Wood's arse on a billboard was more appropriate on screen than a cigarette, I would say he deserved it.

    I noticed that some people on this site are giving this god-awful film good reviews. Anybody giving this film 5 or higher is either A)A troll B)Blind and deaf C)Really stupid or D)One of the cast or crew of this film Sorry but this film belongs in the dustbin of history. Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    Just to make one thing clear before I review this: I never heard or watched this film before. I mean, I was born in the 90s, but I didn't even know this came out the same year as Disney's The Lion King, one of my personal childhood favorites. What really drew my attention to it was not only the Nostalgia Critic review, but the Siskel & Ebert review. At first, I thought it was gonna be one of those average family comedies, but given the quote from Siskel & Ebert themselves (It's junk. First class junk. It's a movie that makes me cringe even when I'm sitting here thinking about it.), I'm personally at their side now. I thought it had a creative, but somewhat sad and unrealistic premise: A boy who leaves his neglected parents and searches all over the world for better ones. It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander, and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. But, when I watched the whole thing online, I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be. Overall, North isn't the worse movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.

    I don't need to say how bad this movie is because Roger Ebert and Doug Walker already have done that for us. It is garbage...no it's garbage of garbage that get spewed out by more garbage and compacted. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm dead serious. The only thing that save this movie is Dan Akyroyd and he's just portraying a Texan stereotype. This movie makes The Room look good by comparison. Save yourselves from the black void that is this movie by watching something better.

Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of "North", the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record, his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could "North" be? Or more accurately put: how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like? Well... "North" is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults, the "philosophical" narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with off-colour jokes and somewhat waspish clich&eacute;s that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where "North" really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work, the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass (the Hawaiian episode springs to mind, in that respect). Of course, one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place (like any other Rob Reiner film) and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that "North" is never funny (which in itself is pure torture for a so-called comedy) but offensive and ultimately mean-spirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects, going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters, the main villain here chief suspect among these, deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life. I so wanted to like this film, if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone, which I admit is rather obnoxious of me. But I simply can't and must add my voice to the sound of the crowd as the song goes. Is "North" the worse film ever made? Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse. But somehow, thinking of it I feel like punching something. So that can't be good...

    North is a story about a kid with a strange name played by pre-Frodo Elijah Wood who thinks mommy and daddy didn't get him enough ice cream and goes to find new ones. That's it. That's the premise of the movie. North's parents are loving but busy despite him being a child prodigy, all the other parents love him, giving us more reason to despise him (and the other kids too I would guess, and rightly so). He takes the advice of Bruce Willis in a rabbit costume, and 'divorces' his parents at the behest of a judge who looks more like a hobo disguised as a judge. North then goes around to strange parodies of parents around the world, including Oklahoma-style parents, some Hawaiians who establish a disgustingly borderline paedophilic poster of him, Eskimoes, Africans, Chinese where they worship him as a God (strange in a communist country), and a Walton-esque clich&eacute; family who seem perfect, but the spoilt little snot-face is still unhappy and abandons them, visits the Amish, the French, and due to some implausible plot line with his former friend, has to return to his parents in the right time without getting killed, only to wake up to discover it was all a dream and he returns home. Not only is this film unfunny, insulting, patronising and stupid, it breaks the one rule of writing. Making the story a dream by the end without making this clear at the start is the worst thing a writer can do. Rob Reiner's career never recovered, but considering he thought pre-teen Elijah Wood's arse on a billboard was more appropriate on screen than a cigarette, I would say he deserved it.

    I noticed that some people on this site are giving this god-awful film good reviews. Anybody giving this film 5 or higher is either A)A troll B)Blind and deaf C)Really stupid or D)One of the cast or crew of this film Sorry but this film belongs in the dustbin of history. Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    Just to make one thing clear before I review this: I never heard or watched this film before. I mean, I was born in the 90s, but I didn't even know this came out the same year as Disney's The Lion King, one of my personal childhood favorites. What really drew my attention to it was not only the Nostalgia Critic review, but the Siskel & Ebert review. At first, I thought it was gonna be one of those average family comedies, but given the quote from Siskel & Ebert themselves (It's junk. First class junk. It's a movie that makes me cringe even when I'm sitting here thinking about it.), I'm personally at their side now. I thought it had a creative, but somewhat sad and unrealistic premise: A boy who leaves his neglected parents and searches all over the world for better ones. It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander, and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. But, when I watched the whole thing online, I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be. Overall, North isn't the worse movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.

    I don't need to say how bad this movie is because Roger Ebert and Doug Walker already have done that for us. It is garbage...no it's garbage of garbage that get spewed out by more garbage and compacted. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm dead serious. The only thing that save this movie is Dan Akyroyd and he's just portraying a Texan stereotype. This movie makes The Room look good by comparison. Save yourselves from the black void that is this movie by watching something better.

    I think the biggest problem with this film is that it has some great people in it. Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and Rob Reiner. It could of been great, but no. There is only one joke in this film that I laughed at. Others either didn't make sense or just were not funny. The casting is terrible for the most part, the characters are nasty, the plot is stupid and the writing is strange. Wood, along with Graham Greene, Abe Vigoda and Matthew McCurly, do give us a nice performance, but that certainly does not make the film worth watching at all. It is terrible. It does not deserve to be watched. You should skip buying this film, unless you really want to see how bad it is.

    The film North (which was released on July 22, 1994) features a comedy-drama-adventure plot written by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman and directed by Rob Reiner. The story is based on the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel. North was Rob Reiner's first recent family-friendly movie. Rob Reiner also directed the greats such as "This is Spinal Tap (1984)", "Misery (1990)", and "A Few Good Men (1992)". The film stars a talented then 13-year old actor Elijah Wood as the main protagonist, North. At the time the film was released in 1994, Elijah Wood was starting to become a somewhat well known celebrity. The film also stars Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, and Abe Vigoda. It is also Scarlett Johansson's debut film, who's gone on to be considered one of the sexiest actresses of our era . North (Elijah Wood) is a eleven year old kid, with busy parents (Julia Louis Dreyfus & Jason Alexander) not giving him the attention he needs. So, North and his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz) file a lawsuit against them. The judge played by Alan Arkin decides that North should either find new parents or return to his own parents by Labor Day  a deadline of two months. If he hasn't found new parents or returned to his by the deadline, he will be sent to an orphanage. So North sets out traveling the world in search of parents who really care about him. His first stop is Texas where he takes a shot at getting to know potentially new parents played by Dan Aykroyd & Reba McEntire. That doesn't work out very well and he moves on to Hawaii and Alaska where he meets an Eskimo mother played by Oscar-winning movie actress Kathy Bates. The parents he encounters in the movie aren't funny, although they aren't serious and turn out not to be helpful to North. Either way, I believe the actors in the movie don't play their characters in the humorous way needed. The film is narrated by Bruce Willis in the form of a mysterious characters who follows North throughout the movie in various character forms - the Easter bunny, a Texan cowboy, a beach bum and a Fed-Ex driver. The narrator first meets North at a mall wearing an Easter bunny costume a role difficult to reconcile with Willis' usual tough-guy role. His role as narrator in the film really falls short. The narrator, in my mind, is not helpful to the movie. One example of this is the way that the narrator verbalizes to North about his terrible parents. Rob Reiner's biggest mistake as a film director takes place with creation of this motion picture, a mistake he himself acknowledged: "North is one of the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life!". I feel sorry for Rob Reiner with respect to his directing of this film, but he, of course, was unaware while directing the film that it would turn out as bad as it did and he probably shouldn't have even made the film whose greatest weakness is the screenplay and film production itself. (Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman also produced the film.) The film North has one of the stupidest stories ever and I disliked every character portrayed in the movie. Even the film was really poor, I still respect Rob Reiner because it is his only failure of a movie; the only truly bad film he's ever directed. Here's my advice: "Do not watch this film! However, you could watch it just to see how bad the movie truly is!" I give that film a 0 out of 4 stars!

    I have difficulty in understanding the low rating given by other reviewers (unless the absence of violence, gratuitous sex and profanity deserves low rating with some reviewers). While it may not be an Academy Award winning candidate, it is really a fun, entertaining and movie which my wife and I found to be hilarious! Good, clean, entertaining movies which are enjoyable for the whole family are all too rare. Unless you like profanity, violence and sex in a movie I highly recommend this for the whole family. We had no idea what it was about, but got "hooked" on it after the first few minutes and enjoyed watching it to the end. It has an excellent cast, and all performed well.

    I'll admit, I'm a fan and a connoisseur of bad movies, and I only watched this because I read Ebert's famous "hated, hated, hated" review. I figured anything that bad had to be at least interesting. Unfortunately, Ebert's review is far more memorable than the movie itself, and probably gave it a lot more attention than it deserved. The movie isn't bad in any really notable or entertaining way, just lame, annoying, and ultimately forgettable. It poses an interesting question; namely, what makes one movie "quirky and charming" and another - well, this? After all, some of the best movies by people like the Coen Brothers or Wes Anderson have fantastical characters and plot elements, and are occasionally mean- spirited. In contrast, this movie falls flat at every turn. There's not a *single* funny line or likable character, but the quality of the acting and production is high enough that it even fails to be "so bad it's good". Oddly, I think the movie it reminded of most was Myra Breckinridge. Both movies are similarly colorful, surreal, remarkably star-studded, completely unfunny, and genuinely unpleasant to watch. Of course, unlike Myra Breckinridge, this was supposed to be a kids' movie! It's lucky that Rob Reiner has so many other great movie to his credit, and generally comes across as a likable guy. Not everyone would be forgiven for this.

    "North" is probably the most hateful movie I've seen in an extremely long time. With a god-awful script with extremely tasteless dialogue, a stupid plot and wasting the perfectly good talent of Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and it's director Rob Reiner (A Few Good Men, The Princess Bride, Misery, When Harry Met Sally, etc.). This movie even makes me cringe when I'm sitting her writing this review A boy (Elijah Wood) gets fed up with his folks and decides to divorce them and go looking for a new set of parents, like Texans (Reba McEntire and Dan Aykroyd), Hawaiians, Eskimos (Kathy Bates, Abe Vigoda) Amish, etc. Everything in this film is UNBELIEVABLY bad! This is a very, very, very, very bad movie. Just like the great Roger Ebert, I hated this movie! I think Elijah Wood is a good actor, and the director Rob Reiner has made one terrific movie after another, but this is garbage. First class garbage!!! I'm sorry, but this sucked!!!

    North (Elijah Wood), a bright and talented eleven year old boy (or so we're told) who clearly never had to go hungry but whose parents are so preoccupied with their career that they don't let him speak at the dinner table to dispense the wisdom his many gifts have bequeathed him (speaking of child-abuse), decide to "divorce" them and find himself a new set of parents more appreciative of his talents. Consequently, he meets a bunch of wannabe quirky characters who all desperately want to adopt him and is being helped along the way by his "guardian angel" (Bruce Willis). I've never really been one to join in on a mob. Crowds generally make me nervous and I usually regard any gathering of any kind with a healthy dose of suspicion. So jumping into any bandwagon just isn't me. Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of "North", the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued.

Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    The film North (which was released on July 22, 1994) features a comedy-drama-adventure plot written by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman and directed by Rob Reiner. The story is based on the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel. North was Rob Reiner's first recent family-friendly movie. Rob Reiner also directed the greats such as "This is Spinal Tap (1984)", "Misery (1990)", and "A Few Good Men (1992)". The film stars a talented then 13-year old actor Elijah Wood as the main protagonist, North.

The film also stars Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, and Abe Vigoda. It is also Scarlett Johansson's debut film, who's gone on to be considered one of the sexiest actresses of our era . North (Elijah Wood) is a eleven year old kid, with busy parents (Julia Louis Dreyfus & Jason Alexander) not giving him the attention he needs. So, North and his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz) file a lawsuit against them. The judge played by Alan Arkin decides that North should either find new parents or return to his own parents by Labor Day  a deadline of two months. If he hasn't found new parents or returned to his by the deadline, he will be sent to an orphanage. So North sets out traveling the world in search of parents who really care about him. His first stop is Texas where he takes a shot at getting to know potentially new parents played by Dan Aykroyd & Reba McEntire. That doesn't work out very well and he moves on to Hawaii and Alaska where he meets an Eskimo mother played by Oscar-winning movie actress Kathy Bates. The parents he encounters in the movie aren't funny, although they aren't serious and turn out not to be helpful to North. Either way, I believe the actors in the movie don't play their characters in the humorous way needed. The film is narrated by Bruce Willis in the form of a mysterious characters who follows North throughout the movie in various character forms - the Easter bunny, a Texan cowboy, a beach bum and a Fed-Ex driver. The narrator first meets North at a mall wearing an Easter bunny costume a role difficult to reconcile with Willis' usual tough-guy role. His role as narrator in the film really falls short. The narrator, in my mind, is not helpful to the movie. One example of this is the way that the narrator verbalizes to North about his terrible parents. Rob Reiner's biggest mistake as a film director takes place with creation of this motion picture, a mistake he himself acknowledged: "North is one of the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life!". I feel sorry for Rob Reiner with respect to his directing of this film, but he, of course, was unaware while directing the film that it would turn out as bad as it did and he probably shouldn't have even made the film whose greatest weakness is the screenplay and film production itself. (Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman also produced the film.) The film North has one of the stupidest stories ever and I disliked every character portrayed in the movie. Even the film was really poor, I still respect Rob Reiner because it is his only failure of a movie; the only truly bad film he's ever directed. Here's my advice: "Do not watch this film! However, you could watch it just to see how bad the movie truly is!" I give that film a 0 out of 4 stars!

    I have difficulty in understanding the low rating given by other reviewers (unless the absence of violence, gratuitous sex and profanity deserves low rating with some reviewers). While it may not be an Academy Award winning candidate, it is really a fun, entertaining and movie which my wife and I found to be hilarious! Good, clean, entertaining movies which are enjoyable for the whole family are all too rare. Unless you like profanity, violence and sex in a movie I highly recommend this for the whole family. We had no idea what it was about, but got "hooked" on it after the first few minutes and enjoyed watching it to the end. It has an excellent cast, and all performed well.

    I'll admit, I'm a fan and a connoisseur of bad movies, and I only watched this because I read Ebert's famous "hated, hated, hated" review. I figured anything that bad had to be at least interesting. Unfortunately, Ebert's review is far more memorable than the movie itself, and probably gave it a lot more attention than it deserved. The movie isn't bad in any really notable or entertaining way, just lame, annoying, and ultimately forgettable. It poses an interesting question; namely, what makes one movie "quirky and charming" and another - well, this? After all, some of the best movies by people like the Coen Brothers or Wes Anderson have fantastical characters and plot elements, and are occasionally mean- spirited. In contrast, this movie falls flat at every turn. There's not a *single* funny line or likable character, but the quality of the acting and production is high enough that it even fails to be "so bad it's good". Oddly, I think the movie it reminded of most was Myra Breckinridge. Both movies are similarly colorful, surreal, remarkably star-studded, completely unfunny, and genuinely unpleasant to watch. Of course, unlike Myra Breckinridge, this was supposed to be a kids' movie! It's lucky that Rob Reiner has so many other great movie to his credit, and generally comes across as a likable guy. Not everyone would be forgiven for this.

    "North" is probably the most hateful movie I've seen in an extremely long time. With a god-awful script with extremely tasteless dialogue, a stupid plot and wasting the perfectly good talent of Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and it's director Rob Reiner (A Few Good Men, The Princess Bride, Misery, When Harry Met Sally, etc.). This movie even makes me cringe when I'm sitting her writing this review A boy (Elijah Wood) gets fed up with his folks and decides to divorce them and go looking for a new set of parents, like Texans (Reba McEntire and Dan Aykroyd), Hawaiians, Eskimos (Kathy Bates, Abe Vigoda) Amish, etc. Everything in this film is UNBELIEVABLY bad! This is a very, very, very, very bad movie. Just like the great Roger Ebert, I hated this movie! I think Elijah Wood is a good actor, and the director Rob Reiner has made one terrific movie after another, but this is garbage. First class garbage!!! I'm sorry, but this sucked!!!

    North (Elijah Wood), a bright and talented eleven year old boy (or so we're told) who clearly never had to go hungry but whose parents are so preoccupied with their career that they don't let him speak at the dinner table to dispense the wisdom his many gifts have bequeathed him (speaking of child-abuse), decide to "divorce" them and find himself a new set of parents more appreciative of his talents. Consequently, he meets a bunch of wannabe quirky characters who all desperately want to adopt him and is being helped along the way by his "guardian angel" (Bruce Willis). I've never really been one to join in on a mob. Crowds generally make me nervous and I usually regard any gathering of any kind with a healthy dose of suspicion. So jumping into any bandwagon just isn't me. Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of "North", the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record, his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could "North" be? Or more accurately put: how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like? Well... "North" is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults, the "philosophical" narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with off-colour jokes and somewhat waspish clich&eacute;s that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where "North" really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work, the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass (the Hawaiian episode springs to mind, in that respect). Of course, one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place (like any other Rob Reiner film) and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that "North" is never funny (which in itself is pure torture for a so-called comedy) but offensive and ultimately mean-spirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects, going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters, the main villain here chief suspect among these, deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life. I so wanted to like this film, if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone, which I admit is rather obnoxious of me. But I simply can't and must add my voice to the sound of the crowd as the song goes. Is "North" the worse film ever made? Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse. But somehow, thinking of it I feel like punching something. So that can't be good...

    North is a story about a kid with a strange name played by pre-Frodo Elijah Wood who thinks mommy and daddy didn't get him enough ice cream and goes to find new ones. That's it. That's the premise of the movie. North's parents are loving but busy despite him being a child prodigy, all the other parents love him, giving us more reason to despise him (and the other kids too I would guess, and rightly so). He takes the advice of Bruce Willis in a rabbit costume, and 'divorces' his parents at the behest of a judge who looks more like a hobo disguised as a judge. North then goes around to strange parodies of parents around the world, including Oklahoma-style parents, some Hawaiians who establish a disgustingly borderline paedophilic poster of him, Eskimoes, Africans, Chinese where they worship him as a God (strange in a communist country), and a Walton-esque clich&eacute; family who seem perfect, but the spoilt little snot-face is still unhappy and abandons them, visits the Amish, the French, and due to some implausible plot line with his former friend, has to return to his parents in the right time without getting killed, only to wake up to discover it was all a dream and he returns home. Not only is this film unfunny, insulting, patronising and stupid, it breaks the one rule of writing. Making the story a dream by the end without making this clear at the start is the worst thing a writer can do. Rob Reiner's career never recovered, but considering he thought pre-teen Elijah Wood's arse on a billboard was more appropriate on screen than a cigarette, I would say he deserved it.

    I noticed that some people on this site are giving this god-awful film good reviews. Anybody giving this film 5 or higher is either A)A troll B)Blind and deaf C)Really stupid or D)One of the cast or crew of this film Sorry but this film belongs in the dustbin of history. Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    Just to make one thing clear before I review this: I never heard or watched this film before. I mean, I was born in the 90s, but I didn't even know this came out the same year as Disney's The Lion King, one of my personal childhood favorites. What really drew my attention to it was not only the Nostalgia Critic review, but the Siskel & Ebert review. At first, I thought it was gonna be one of those average family comedies, but given the quote from Siskel & Ebert themselves (It's junk. First class junk. It's a movie that makes me cringe even when I'm sitting here thinking about it.), I'm personally at their side now. I thought it had a creative, but somewhat sad and unrealistic premise: A boy who leaves his neglected parents and searches all over the world for better ones. It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander, and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. But, when I watched the whole thing online, I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be. Overall, North isn't the worse movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.

    I don't need to say how bad this movie is because Roger Ebert and Doug Walker already have done that for us. It is garbage...no it's garbage of garbage that get spewed out by more garbage and compacted. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm dead serious. The only thing that save this movie is Dan Akyroyd and he's just portraying a Texan stereotype. This movie makes The Room look good by comparison. Save yourselves from the black void that is this movie by watching something better.

    I think the biggest problem with this film is that it has some great people in it. Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and Rob Reiner. It could of been great, but no. There is only one joke in this film that I laughed at. Others either didn't make sense or just were not funny. The casting is terrible for the most part, the characters are nasty, the plot is stupid and the writing is strange. Wood, along with Graham Greene, Abe Vigoda and Matthew McCurly, do give us a nice performance, but that certainly does not make the film worth watching at all. It is terrible. It does not deserve to be watched. You should skip buying this film, unless you really want to see how bad it is.

    The film North (which was released on July 22, 1994) features a comedy-drama-adventure plot written by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman and directed by Rob Reiner. The story is based on the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel. North was Rob Reiner's first recent family-friendly movie. Rob Reiner also directed the greats such as "This is Spinal Tap (1984)", "Misery (1990)", and "A Few Good Men (1992)". The film stars a talented then 13-year old actor Elijah Wood as the main protagonist, North. At the time the film was released in 1994, Elijah Wood was starting to become a somewhat well known celebrity. The film also stars Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, and Abe Vigoda. It is also Scarlett Johansson's debut film, who's gone on to be considered one of the sexiest actresses of our era . North (Elijah Wood) is a eleven year old kid, with busy parents (Julia Louis Dreyfus & Jason Alexander) not giving him the attention he needs. So, North and his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz) file a lawsuit against them. The judge played by Alan Arkin decides that North should either find new parents or return to his own parents by Labor Day  a deadline of two months. If he hasn't found new parents or returned to his by the deadline, he will be sent to an orphanage. So North sets out traveling the world in search of parents who really care about him. His first stop is Texas where he takes a shot at getting to know potentially new parents played by Dan Aykroyd & Reba McEntire. That doesn't work out very well and he moves on to Hawaii and Alaska where he meets an Eskimo mother played by Oscar-winning movie actress Kathy Bates. The parents he encounters in the movie aren't funny, although they aren't serious and turn out not to be helpful to North. Either way, I believe the actors in the movie don't play their characters in the humorous way needed. The film is narrated by Bruce Willis in the form of a mysterious characters who follows North throughout the movie in various character forms - the Easter bunny, a Texan cowboy, a beach bum and a Fed-Ex driver.

Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    Just to make one thing clear before I review this: I never heard or watched this film before. I mean, I was born in the 90s, but I didn't even know this came out the same year as Disney's The Lion King, one of my personal childhood favorites. What really drew my attention to it was not only the Nostalgia Critic review, but the Siskel & Ebert review. At first, I thought it was gonna be one of those average family comedies, but given the quote from Siskel & Ebert themselves (It's junk. First class junk. It's a movie that makes me cringe even when I'm sitting here thinking about it.), I'm personally at their side now. I thought it had a creative, but somewhat sad and unrealistic premise: A boy who leaves his neglected parents and searches all over the world for better ones. It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander, and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. But, when I watched the whole thing online, I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be. Overall, North isn't the worse movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.

    I don't need to say how bad this movie is because Roger Ebert and Doug Walker already have done that for us. It is garbage...no it's garbage of garbage that get spewed out by more garbage and compacted. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm dead serious. The only thing that save this movie is Dan Akyroyd and he's just portraying a Texan stereotype. This movie makes The Room look good by comparison. Save yourselves from the black void that is this movie by watching something better.

    I think the biggest problem with this film is that it has some great people in it. Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and Rob Reiner. It could of been great, but no. There is only one joke in this film that I laughed at. Others either didn't make sense or just were not funny. The casting is terrible for the most part, the characters are nasty, the plot is stupid and the writing is strange. Wood, along with Graham Greene, Abe Vigoda and Matthew McCurly, do give us a nice performance, but that certainly does not make the film worth watching at all. It is terrible. It does not deserve to be watched. You should skip buying this film, unless you really want to see how bad it is.

    The film North (which was released on July 22, 1994) features a comedy-drama-adventure plot written by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman and directed by Rob Reiner. The story is based on the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel. North was Rob Reiner's first recent family-friendly movie. Rob Reiner also directed the greats such as "This is Spinal Tap (1984)", "Misery (1990)", and "A Few Good Men (1992)". The film stars a talented then 13-year old actor Elijah Wood as the main protagonist, North. At the time the film was released in 1994, Elijah Wood was starting to become a somewhat well known celebrity. The film also stars Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, and Abe Vigoda. It is also Scarlett Johansson's debut film, who's gone on to be considered one of the sexiest actresses of our era . North (Elijah Wood) is a eleven year old kid, with busy parents (Julia Louis Dreyfus & Jason Alexander) not giving him the attention he needs. So, North and his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz) file a lawsuit against them. The judge played by Alan Arkin decides that North should either find new parents or return to his own parents by Labor Day  a deadline of two months. If he hasn't found new parents or returned to his by the deadline, he will be sent to an orphanage. So North sets out traveling the world in search of parents who really care about him. His first stop is Texas where he takes a shot at getting to know potentially new parents played by Dan Aykroyd & Reba McEntire. That doesn't work out very well and he moves on to Hawaii and Alaska where he meets an Eskimo mother played by Oscar-winning movie actress Kathy Bates. The parents he encounters in the movie aren't funny, although they aren't serious and turn out not to be helpful to North. Either way, I believe the actors in the movie don't play their characters in the humorous way needed. The film is narrated by Bruce Willis in the form of a mysterious characters who follows North throughout the movie in various character forms - the Easter bunny, a Texan cowboy, a beach bum and a Fed-Ex driver. The narrator first meets North at a mall wearing an Easter bunny costume a role difficult to reconcile with Willis' usual tough-guy role. His role as narrator in the film really falls short. The narrator, in my mind, is not helpful to the movie. One example of this is the way that the narrator verbalizes to North about his terrible parents. Rob Reiner's biggest mistake as a film director takes place with creation of this motion picture, a mistake he himself acknowledged: "North is one of the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life!". I feel sorry for Rob Reiner with respect to his directing of this film, but he, of course, was unaware while directing the film that it would turn out as bad as it did and he probably shouldn't have even made the film whose greatest weakness is the screenplay and film production itself. (Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman also produced the film.) The film North has one of the stupidest stories ever and I disliked every character portrayed in the movie. Even the film was really poor, I still respect Rob Reiner because it is his only failure of a movie; the only truly bad film he's ever directed. Here's my advice: "Do not watch this film! However, you could watch it just to see how bad the movie truly is!" I give that film a 0 out of 4 stars!

    I have difficulty in understanding the low rating given by other reviewers (unless the absence of violence, gratuitous sex and profanity deserves low rating with some reviewers). While it may not be an Academy Award winning candidate, it is really a fun, entertaining and movie which my wife and I found to be hilarious! Good, clean, entertaining movies which are enjoyable for the whole family are all too rare. Unless you like profanity, violence and sex in a movie I highly recommend this for the whole family. We had no idea what it was about, but got "hooked" on it after the first few minutes and enjoyed watching it to the end. It has an excellent cast, and all performed well.

    I'll admit, I'm a fan and a connoisseur of bad movies, and I only watched this because I read Ebert's famous "hated, hated, hated" review. I figured anything that bad had to be at least interesting. Unfortunately, Ebert's review is far more memorable than the movie itself, and probably gave it a lot more attention than it deserved. The movie isn't bad in any really notable or entertaining way, just lame, annoying, and ultimately forgettable. It poses an interesting question; namely, what makes one movie "quirky and charming" and another - well, this? After all, some of the best movies by people like the Coen Brothers or Wes Anderson have fantastical characters and plot elements, and are occasionally mean- spirited. In contrast, this movie falls flat at every turn. There's not a *single* funny line or likable character, but the quality of the acting and production is high enough that it even fails to be "so bad it's good". Oddly, I think the movie it reminded of most was Myra Breckinridge. Both movies are similarly colorful, surreal, remarkably star-studded, completely unfunny, and genuinely unpleasant to watch. Of course, unlike Myra Breckinridge, this was supposed to be a kids' movie! It's lucky that Rob Reiner has so many other great movie to his credit, and generally comes across as a likable guy. Not everyone would be forgiven for this.

    "North" is probably the most hateful movie I've seen in an extremely long time. With a god-awful script with extremely tasteless dialogue, a stupid plot and wasting the perfectly good talent of Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and it's director Rob Reiner (A Few Good Men, The Princess Bride, Misery, When Harry Met Sally, etc.). This movie even makes me cringe when I'm sitting her writing this review A boy (Elijah Wood) gets fed up with his folks and decides to divorce them and go looking for a new set of parents, like Texans (Reba McEntire and Dan Aykroyd), Hawaiians, Eskimos (Kathy Bates, Abe Vigoda) Amish, etc. Everything in this film is UNBELIEVABLY bad! This is a very, very, very, very bad movie. Just like the great Roger Ebert, I hated this movie! I think Elijah Wood is a good actor, and the director Rob Reiner has made one terrific movie after another, but this is garbage. First class garbage!!! I'm sorry, but this sucked!!!

    North (Elijah Wood), a bright and talented eleven year old boy (or so we're told) who clearly never had to go hungry but whose parents are so preoccupied with their career that they don't let him speak at the dinner table to dispense the wisdom his many gifts have bequeathed him (speaking of child-abuse), decide to "divorce" them and find himself a new set of parents more appreciative of his talents. Consequently, he meets a bunch of wannabe quirky characters who all desperately want to adopt him and is being helped along the way by his "guardian angel" (Bruce Willis). I've never really been one to join in on a mob. Crowds generally make me nervous and I usually regard any gathering of any kind with a healthy dose of suspicion. So jumping into any bandwagon just isn't me. Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of "North", the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record, his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could "North" be? Or more accurately put: how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like? Well... "North" is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults, the "philosophical" narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with off-colour jokes and somewhat waspish clich&eacute;s that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where "North" really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work, the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass (the Hawaiian episode springs to mind, in that respect). Of course, one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place (like any other Rob Reiner film) and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that "North" is never funny (which in itself is pure torture for a so-called comedy) but offensive and ultimately mean-spirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects, going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters, the main villain here chief suspect among these, deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life. I so wanted to like this film, if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone, which I admit is rather obnoxious of me. But I simply can't and must add my voice to the sound of the crowd as the song goes. Is "North" the worse film ever made? Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse. But somehow, thinking of it I feel like punching something. So that can't be good...

    North is a story about a kid with a strange name played by pre-Frodo Elijah Wood who thinks mommy and daddy didn't get him enough ice cream and goes to find new ones. That's it. That's the premise of the movie. North's parents are loving but busy despite him being a child prodigy, all the other parents love him, giving us more reason to despise him (and the other kids too I would guess, and rightly so). He takes the advice of Bruce Willis in a rabbit costume, and 'divorces' his parents at the behest of a judge who looks more like a hobo disguised as a judge. North then goes around to strange parodies of parents around the world, including Oklahoma-style parents, some Hawaiians who establish a disgustingly borderline paedophilic poster of him, Eskimoes, Africans, Chinese where they worship him as a God (strange in a communist country), and a Walton-esque clich&eacute; family who seem perfect, but the spoilt little snot-face is still unhappy and abandons them, visits the Amish, the French, and due to some implausible plot line with his former friend, has to return to his parents in the right time without getting killed, only to wake up to discover it was all a dream and he returns home. Not only is this film unfunny, insulting, patronising and stupid, it breaks the one rule of writing. Making the story a dream by the end without making this clear at the start is the worst thing a writer can do. Rob Reiner's career never recovered, but considering he thought pre-teen Elijah Wood's arse on a billboard was more appropriate on screen than a cigarette, I would say he deserved it.

Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    The film North (which was released on July 22, 1994) features a comedy-drama-adventure plot written by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman and directed by Rob Reiner. The story is based on the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel. North was Rob Reiner's first recent family-friendly movie. Rob Reiner also directed the greats such as "This is Spinal Tap (1984)", "Misery (1990)", and "A Few Good Men (1992)". The film stars a talented then 13-year old actor Elijah Wood as the main protagonist, North.

In contrast, this movie falls flat at every turn. There's not a *single* funny line or likable character, but the quality of the acting and production is high enough that it even fails to be "so bad it's good". Oddly, I think the movie it reminded of most was Myra Breckinridge. Both movies are similarly colorful, surreal, remarkably star-studded, completely unfunny, and genuinely unpleasant to watch. Of course, unlike Myra Breckinridge, this was supposed to be a kids' movie! It's lucky that Rob Reiner has so many other great movie to his credit, and generally comes across as a likable guy. Not everyone would be forgiven for this.

    "North" is probably the most hateful movie I've seen in an extremely long time. With a god-awful script with extremely tasteless dialogue, a stupid plot and wasting the perfectly good talent of Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and it's director Rob Reiner (A Few Good Men, The Princess Bride, Misery, When Harry Met Sally, etc.). This movie even makes me cringe when I'm sitting her writing this review A boy (Elijah Wood) gets fed up with his folks and decides to divorce them and go looking for a new set of parents, like Texans (Reba McEntire and Dan Aykroyd), Hawaiians, Eskimos (Kathy Bates, Abe Vigoda) Amish, etc. Everything in this film is UNBELIEVABLY bad! This is a very, very, very, very bad movie. Just like the great Roger Ebert, I hated this movie! I think Elijah Wood is a good actor, and the director Rob Reiner has made one terrific movie after another, but this is garbage. First class garbage!!! I'm sorry, but this sucked!!!

    North (Elijah Wood), a bright and talented eleven year old boy (or so we're told) who clearly never had to go hungry but whose parents are so preoccupied with their career that they don't let him speak at the dinner table to dispense the wisdom his many gifts have bequeathed him (speaking of child-abuse), decide to "divorce" them and find himself a new set of parents more appreciative of his talents. Consequently, he meets a bunch of wannabe quirky characters who all desperately want to adopt him and is being helped along the way by his "guardian angel" (Bruce Willis). I've never really been one to join in on a mob. Crowds generally make me nervous and I usually regard any gathering of any kind with a healthy dose of suspicion. So jumping into any bandwagon just isn't me. Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of "North", the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record, his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could "North" be? Or more accurately put: how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like? Well... "North" is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults, the "philosophical" narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with off-colour jokes and somewhat waspish clich&eacute;s that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where "North" really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work, the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass (the Hawaiian episode springs to mind, in that respect). Of course, one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place (like any other Rob Reiner film) and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that "North" is never funny (which in itself is pure torture for a so-called comedy) but offensive and ultimately mean-spirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects, going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters, the main villain here chief suspect among these, deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life. I so wanted to like this film, if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone, which I admit is rather obnoxious of me. But I simply can't and must add my voice to the sound of the crowd as the song goes. Is "North" the worse film ever made? Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse. But somehow, thinking of it I feel like punching something. So that can't be good...

    North is a story about a kid with a strange name played by pre-Frodo Elijah Wood who thinks mommy and daddy didn't get him enough ice cream and goes to find new ones. That's it. That's the premise of the movie. North's parents are loving but busy despite him being a child prodigy, all the other parents love him, giving us more reason to despise him (and the other kids too I would guess, and rightly so). He takes the advice of Bruce Willis in a rabbit costume, and 'divorces' his parents at the behest of a judge who looks more like a hobo disguised as a judge. North then goes around to strange parodies of parents around the world, including Oklahoma-style parents, some Hawaiians who establish a disgustingly borderline paedophilic poster of him, Eskimoes, Africans, Chinese where they worship him as a God (strange in a communist country), and a Walton-esque clich&eacute; family who seem perfect, but the spoilt little snot-face is still unhappy and abandons them, visits the Amish, the French, and due to some implausible plot line with his former friend, has to return to his parents in the right time without getting killed, only to wake up to discover it was all a dream and he returns home. Not only is this film unfunny, insulting, patronising and stupid, it breaks the one rule of writing. Making the story a dream by the end without making this clear at the start is the worst thing a writer can do. Rob Reiner's career never recovered, but considering he thought pre-teen Elijah Wood's arse on a billboard was more appropriate on screen than a cigarette, I would say he deserved it.

    I noticed that some people on this site are giving this god-awful film good reviews. Anybody giving this film 5 or higher is either A)A troll B)Blind and deaf C)Really stupid or D)One of the cast or crew of this film Sorry but this film belongs in the dustbin of history. Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    Just to make one thing clear before I review this: I never heard or watched this film before. I mean, I was born in the 90s, but I didn't even know this came out the same year as Disney's The Lion King, one of my personal childhood favorites. What really drew my attention to it was not only the Nostalgia Critic review, but the Siskel & Ebert review. At first, I thought it was gonna be one of those average family comedies, but given the quote from Siskel & Ebert themselves (It's junk. First class junk. It's a movie that makes me cringe even when I'm sitting here thinking about it.), I'm personally at their side now. I thought it had a creative, but somewhat sad and unrealistic premise: A boy who leaves his neglected parents and searches all over the world for better ones. It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander, and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. But, when I watched the whole thing online, I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be. Overall, North isn't the worse movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.

    I don't need to say how bad this movie is because Roger Ebert and Doug Walker already have done that for us. It is garbage...no it's garbage of garbage that get spewed out by more garbage and compacted. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm dead serious. The only thing that save this movie is Dan Akyroyd and he's just portraying a Texan stereotype. This movie makes The Room look good by comparison. Save yourselves from the black void that is this movie by watching something better.

    I think the biggest problem with this film is that it has some great people in it. Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and Rob Reiner. It could of been great, but no. There is only one joke in this film that I laughed at. Others either didn't make sense or just were not funny. The casting is terrible for the most part, the characters are nasty, the plot is stupid and the writing is strange. Wood, along with Graham Greene, Abe Vigoda and Matthew McCurly, do give us a nice performance, but that certainly does not make the film worth watching at all. It is terrible. It does not deserve to be watched. You should skip buying this film, unless you really want to see how bad it is.

    The film North (which was released on July 22, 1994) features a comedy-drama-adventure plot written by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman and directed by Rob Reiner. The story is based on the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel. North was Rob Reiner's first recent family-friendly movie. Rob Reiner also directed the greats such as "This is Spinal Tap (1984)", "Misery (1990)", and "A Few Good Men (1992)". The film stars a talented then 13-year old actor Elijah Wood as the main protagonist, North. At the time the film was released in 1994, Elijah Wood was starting to become a somewhat well known celebrity. The film also stars Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, and Abe Vigoda. It is also Scarlett Johansson's debut film, who's gone on to be considered one of the sexiest actresses of our era . North (Elijah Wood) is a eleven year old kid, with busy parents (Julia Louis Dreyfus & Jason Alexander) not giving him the attention he needs. So, North and his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz) file a lawsuit against them. The judge played by Alan Arkin decides that North should either find new parents or return to his own parents by Labor Day  a deadline of two months. If he hasn't found new parents or returned to his by the deadline, he will be sent to an orphanage. So North sets out traveling the world in search of parents who really care about him. His first stop is Texas where he takes a shot at getting to know potentially new parents played by Dan Aykroyd & Reba McEntire. That doesn't work out very well and he moves on to Hawaii and Alaska where he meets an Eskimo mother played by Oscar-winning movie actress Kathy Bates. The parents he encounters in the movie aren't funny, although they aren't serious and turn out not to be helpful to North. Either way, I believe the actors in the movie don't play their characters in the humorous way needed. The film is narrated by Bruce Willis in the form of a mysterious characters who follows North throughout the movie in various character forms - the Easter bunny, a Texan cowboy, a beach bum and a Fed-Ex driver. The narrator first meets North at a mall wearing an Easter bunny costume a role difficult to reconcile with Willis' usual tough-guy role. His role as narrator in the film really falls short. The narrator, in my mind, is not helpful to the movie. One example of this is the way that the narrator verbalizes to North about his terrible parents. Rob Reiner's biggest mistake as a film director takes place with creation of this motion picture, a mistake he himself acknowledged: "North is one of the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life!". I feel sorry for Rob Reiner with respect to his directing of this film, but he, of course, was unaware while directing the film that it would turn out as bad as it did and he probably shouldn't have even made the film whose greatest weakness is the screenplay and film production itself. (Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman also produced the film.) The film North has one of the stupidest stories ever and I disliked every character portrayed in the movie. Even the film was really poor, I still respect Rob Reiner because it is his only failure of a movie; the only truly bad film he's ever directed. Here's my advice: "Do not watch this film! However, you could watch it just to see how bad the movie truly is!" I give that film a 0 out of 4 stars!

    I have difficulty in understanding the low rating given by other reviewers (unless the absence of violence, gratuitous sex and profanity deserves low rating with some reviewers). While it may not be an Academy Award winning candidate, it is really a fun, entertaining and movie which my wife and I found to be hilarious! Good, clean, entertaining movies which are enjoyable for the whole family are all too rare. Unless you like profanity, violence and sex in a movie I highly recommend this for the whole family. We had no idea what it was about, but got "hooked" on it after the first few minutes and enjoyed watching it to the end. It has an excellent cast, and all performed well.

    I'll admit, I'm a fan and a connoisseur of bad movies, and I only watched this because I read Ebert's famous "hated, hated, hated" review. I figured anything that bad had to be at least interesting. Unfortunately, Ebert's review is far more memorable than the movie itself, and probably gave it a lot more attention than it deserved. The movie isn't bad in any really notable or entertaining way, just lame, annoying, and ultimately forgettable. It poses an interesting question; namely, what makes one movie "quirky and charming" and another - well, this? After all, some of the best movies by people like the Coen Brothers or Wes Anderson have fantastical characters and plot elements, and are occasionally mean- spirited. In contrast, this movie falls flat at every turn. There's not a *single* funny line or likable character, but the quality of the acting and production is high enough that it even fails to be "so bad it's good". Oddly, I think the movie it reminded of most was Myra Breckinridge. Both movies are similarly colorful, surreal, remarkably star-studded, completely unfunny, and genuinely unpleasant to watch. Of course, unlike Myra Breckinridge, this was supposed to be a kids' movie! It's lucky that Rob Reiner has so many other great movie to his credit, and generally comes across as a likable guy. Not everyone would be forgiven for this.

Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    I don't need to say how bad this movie is because Roger Ebert and Doug Walker already have done that for us. It is garbage...no it's garbage of garbage that get spewed out by more garbage and compacted. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm dead serious. The only thing that save this movie is Dan Akyroyd and he's just portraying a Texan stereotype. This movie makes The Room look good by comparison. Save yourselves from the black void that is this movie by watching something better.

    I think the biggest problem with this film is that it has some great people in it. Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and Rob Reiner. It could of been great, but no. There is only one joke in this film that I laughed at. Others either didn't make sense or just were not funny. The casting is terrible for the most part, the characters are nasty, the plot is stupid and the writing is strange. Wood, along with Graham Greene, Abe Vigoda and Matthew McCurly, do give us a nice performance, but that certainly does not make the film worth watching at all. It is terrible. It does not deserve to be watched. You should skip buying this film, unless you really want to see how bad it is.

    The film North (which was released on July 22, 1994) features a comedy-drama-adventure plot written by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman and directed by Rob Reiner. The story is based on the novel North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents by Alan Zweibel. North was Rob Reiner's first recent family-friendly movie. Rob Reiner also directed the greats such as "This is Spinal Tap (1984)", "Misery (1990)", and "A Few Good Men (1992)". The film stars a talented then 13-year old actor Elijah Wood as the main protagonist, North. At the time the film was released in 1994, Elijah Wood was starting to become a somewhat well known celebrity. The film also stars Jon Lovitz, Jason Alexander, Alan Arkin, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, Faith Ford, Graham Greene, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Reba McEntire, John Ritter, and Abe Vigoda. It is also Scarlett Johansson's debut film, who's gone on to be considered one of the sexiest actresses of our era . North (Elijah Wood) is a eleven year old kid, with busy parents (Julia Louis Dreyfus & Jason Alexander) not giving him the attention he needs. So, North and his lawyer Arthur Belt (Jon Lovitz) file a lawsuit against them. The judge played by Alan Arkin decides that North should either find new parents or return to his own parents by Labor Day  a deadline of two months. If he hasn't found new parents or returned to his by the deadline, he will be sent to an orphanage. So North sets out traveling the world in search of parents who really care about him. His first stop is Texas where he takes a shot at getting to know potentially new parents played by Dan Aykroyd & Reba McEntire. That doesn't work out very well and he moves on to Hawaii and Alaska where he meets an Eskimo mother played by Oscar-winning movie actress Kathy Bates. The parents he encounters in the movie aren't funny, although they aren't serious and turn out not to be helpful to North. Either way, I believe the actors in the movie don't play their characters in the humorous way needed. The film is narrated by Bruce Willis in the form of a mysterious characters who follows North throughout the movie in various character forms - the Easter bunny, a Texan cowboy, a beach bum and a Fed-Ex driver. The narrator first meets North at a mall wearing an Easter bunny costume a role difficult to reconcile with Willis' usual tough-guy role. His role as narrator in the film really falls short. The narrator, in my mind, is not helpful to the movie. One example of this is the way that the narrator verbalizes to North about his terrible parents. Rob Reiner's biggest mistake as a film director takes place with creation of this motion picture, a mistake he himself acknowledged: "North is one of the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life!". I feel sorry for Rob Reiner with respect to his directing of this film, but he, of course, was unaware while directing the film that it would turn out as bad as it did and he probably shouldn't have even made the film whose greatest weakness is the screenplay and film production itself. (Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman also produced the film.) The film North has one of the stupidest stories ever and I disliked every character portrayed in the movie. Even the film was really poor, I still respect Rob Reiner because it is his only failure of a movie; the only truly bad film he's ever directed. Here's my advice: "Do not watch this film! However, you could watch it just to see how bad the movie truly is!" I give that film a 0 out of 4 stars!

    I have difficulty in understanding the low rating given by other reviewers (unless the absence of violence, gratuitous sex and profanity deserves low rating with some reviewers). While it may not be an Academy Award winning candidate, it is really a fun, entertaining and movie which my wife and I found to be hilarious! Good, clean, entertaining movies which are enjoyable for the whole family are all too rare. Unless you like profanity, violence and sex in a movie I highly recommend this for the whole family. We had no idea what it was about, but got "hooked" on it after the first few minutes and enjoyed watching it to the end. It has an excellent cast, and all performed well.

    I'll admit, I'm a fan and a connoisseur of bad movies, and I only watched this because I read Ebert's famous "hated, hated, hated" review. I figured anything that bad had to be at least interesting. Unfortunately, Ebert's review is far more memorable than the movie itself, and probably gave it a lot more attention than it deserved. The movie isn't bad in any really notable or entertaining way, just lame, annoying, and ultimately forgettable. It poses an interesting question; namely, what makes one movie "quirky and charming" and another - well, this? After all, some of the best movies by people like the Coen Brothers or Wes Anderson have fantastical characters and plot elements, and are occasionally mean- spirited. In contrast, this movie falls flat at every turn. There's not a *single* funny line or likable character, but the quality of the acting and production is high enough that it even fails to be "so bad it's good". Oddly, I think the movie it reminded of most was Myra Breckinridge. Both movies are similarly colorful, surreal, remarkably star-studded, completely unfunny, and genuinely unpleasant to watch. Of course, unlike Myra Breckinridge, this was supposed to be a kids' movie! It's lucky that Rob Reiner has so many other great movie to his credit, and generally comes across as a likable guy. Not everyone would be forgiven for this.

    "North" is probably the most hateful movie I've seen in an extremely long time. With a god-awful script with extremely tasteless dialogue, a stupid plot and wasting the perfectly good talent of Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis and it's director Rob Reiner (A Few Good Men, The Princess Bride, Misery, When Harry Met Sally, etc.). This movie even makes me cringe when I'm sitting her writing this review A boy (Elijah Wood) gets fed up with his folks and decides to divorce them and go looking for a new set of parents, like Texans (Reba McEntire and Dan Aykroyd), Hawaiians, Eskimos (Kathy Bates, Abe Vigoda) Amish, etc. Everything in this film is UNBELIEVABLY bad! This is a very, very, very, very bad movie. Just like the great Roger Ebert, I hated this movie! I think Elijah Wood is a good actor, and the director Rob Reiner has made one terrific movie after another, but this is garbage. First class garbage!!! I'm sorry, but this sucked!!!

    North (Elijah Wood), a bright and talented eleven year old boy (or so we're told) who clearly never had to go hungry but whose parents are so preoccupied with their career that they don't let him speak at the dinner table to dispense the wisdom his many gifts have bequeathed him (speaking of child-abuse), decide to "divorce" them and find himself a new set of parents more appreciative of his talents. Consequently, he meets a bunch of wannabe quirky characters who all desperately want to adopt him and is being helped along the way by his "guardian angel" (Bruce Willis). I've never really been one to join in on a mob. Crowds generally make me nervous and I usually regard any gathering of any kind with a healthy dose of suspicion. So jumping into any bandwagon just isn't me. Furthermore, I've always had a soft spot for the underdog, the ugly duckling, the universally vilified, always finding redeeming features to features that usually can't be redeemed. So obviously, when I heard of "North", the 1994 comedy from director Rob Reiner, with its stellar cast and very bad reputation, I was intrigued. Reiner has always been a director with a rather good track record, his movies usually ranging from decent to excellent. So how bad could "North" be? Or more accurately put: how does a bad Rob Reiner film look like? Well... "North" is a film that constantly struggles to find its audience and eventually fails to find any. As a film for adults, the "philosophical" narration provided by Bruce Willis never succeeds to soften the absurdity of the plot and as a film for children the whole thing is riddled with off-colour jokes and somewhat waspish clich&eacute;s that make this spectacle quite inappropriate for that particular target audience. But where "North" really goes south is that failing to have a single joke that work, the film goes for the jugular and turns downright crass (the Hawaiian episode springs to mind, in that respect). Of course, one could argue that the film has its heart beating at the right place (like any other Rob Reiner film) and was simply a misguided effort but not quite. The fact of the matter is that "North" is never funny (which in itself is pure torture for a so-called comedy) but offensive and ultimately mean-spirited through its boring stereotypes and its attempts at poking fun at somewhat dodgy subjects, going as far as insulting the audience's intelligence with truck loads of ludicrous and stupid characters, the main villain here chief suspect among these, deserving of a good spanking before being sent to bed without dessert... for life. I so wanted to like this film, if only for the fact that it was generally reviled by everyone, which I admit is rather obnoxious of me. But I simply can't and must add my voice to the sound of the crowd as the song goes. Is "North" the worse film ever made? Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse. But somehow, thinking of it I feel like punching something. So that can't be good...

    North is a story about a kid with a strange name played by pre-Frodo Elijah Wood who thinks mommy and daddy didn't get him enough ice cream and goes to find new ones. That's it. That's the premise of the movie. North's parents are loving but busy despite him being a child prodigy, all the other parents love him, giving us more reason to despise him (and the other kids too I would guess, and rightly so). He takes the advice of Bruce Willis in a rabbit costume, and 'divorces' his parents at the behest of a judge who looks more like a hobo disguised as a judge. North then goes around to strange parodies of parents around the world, including Oklahoma-style parents, some Hawaiians who establish a disgustingly borderline paedophilic poster of him, Eskimoes, Africans, Chinese where they worship him as a God (strange in a communist country), and a Walton-esque clich&eacute; family who seem perfect, but the spoilt little snot-face is still unhappy and abandons them, visits the Amish, the French, and due to some implausible plot line with his former friend, has to return to his parents in the right time without getting killed, only to wake up to discover it was all a dream and he returns home. Not only is this film unfunny, insulting, patronising and stupid, it breaks the one rule of writing. Making the story a dream by the end without making this clear at the start is the worst thing a writer can do. Rob Reiner's career never recovered, but considering he thought pre-teen Elijah Wood's arse on a billboard was more appropriate on screen than a cigarette, I would say he deserved it.

    I noticed that some people on this site are giving this god-awful film good reviews. Anybody giving this film 5 or higher is either A)A troll B)Blind and deaf C)Really stupid or D)One of the cast or crew of this film Sorry but this film belongs in the dustbin of history. Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    Just to make one thing clear before I review this: I never heard or watched this film before. I mean, I was born in the 90s, but I didn't even know this came out the same year as Disney's The Lion King, one of my personal childhood favorites. What really drew my attention to it was not only the Nostalgia Critic review, but the Siskel & Ebert review. At first, I thought it was gonna be one of those average family comedies, but given the quote from Siskel & Ebert themselves (It's junk. First class junk. It's a movie that makes me cringe even when I'm sitting here thinking about it.), I'm personally at their side now. I thought it had a creative, but somewhat sad and unrealistic premise: A boy who leaves his neglected parents and searches all over the world for better ones. It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander, and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. But, when I watched the whole thing online, I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be. Overall, North isn't the worse movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.

But I simply can't and must add my voice to the sound of the crowd as the song goes. Is "North" the worse film ever made? Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse. But somehow, thinking of it I feel like punching something. So that can't be good...

    North is a story about a kid with a strange name played by pre-Frodo Elijah Wood who thinks mommy and daddy didn't get him enough ice cream and goes to find new ones. That's it. That's the premise of the movie. North's parents are loving but busy despite him being a child prodigy, all the other parents love him, giving us more reason to despise him (and the other kids too I would guess, and rightly so). He takes the advice of Bruce Willis in a rabbit costume, and 'divorces' his parents at the behest of a judge who looks more like a hobo disguised as a judge. North then goes around to strange parodies of parents around the world, including Oklahoma-style parents, some Hawaiians who establish a disgustingly borderline paedophilic poster of him, Eskimoes, Africans, Chinese where they worship him as a God (strange in a communist country), and a Walton-esque clich&eacute; family who seem perfect, but the spoilt little snot-face is still unhappy and abandons them, visits the Amish, the French, and due to some implausible plot line with his former friend, has to return to his parents in the right time without getting killed, only to wake up to discover it was all a dream and he returns home. Not only is this film unfunny, insulting, patronising and stupid, it breaks the one rule of writing. Making the story a dream by the end without making this clear at the start is the worst thing a writer can do. Rob Reiner's career never recovered, but considering he thought pre-teen Elijah Wood's arse on a billboard was more appropriate on screen than a cigarette, I would say he deserved it.

    I noticed that some people on this site are giving this god-awful film good reviews. Anybody giving this film 5 or higher is either A)A troll B)Blind and deaf C)Really stupid or D)One of the cast or crew of this film Sorry but this film belongs in the dustbin of history. Rodger Ebert was correct about this film. I hated it even when I was a kid. OK so here is the "plot"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP AHEAD TO THE END OF MY REVIEW) North(Elijah Wood,BEFORE he was Frodo)is a kid that has parents that don't see his talents and is upset about this. So one day he is at a mall and gets visited by Bruce Willis(Who is some pedo in a bunny suit) and tells him to make up with his parents,but he doesn't listen and hires a lawyer to divorce his parents(This causes his parents to pass out). So he moves to Texas where he meets a stereotypical western family that sing a REALLY bad musical number about the things that they are gonna do to him. So he leaves and goes to Hawaii where he meets a stereotypical Hawaiian couple named Mr. and Mrs. Ho (Some last name). They plan to display a picture of North's ass on billboards on every major highway in the mainland. This causes North to go to Alaska where he movies in with Sarah Palin and her family! Nah,I'm just kidding,he didn't move in with Sarah Palin,but he did move in with a family that is just as bad. The family is a stereotypical Inuit family,and the lady of the family is Kathy Bates wearing BLACKFACE to portray an Inuit. He then tries a bunch of other families that are ethnic stereotypes then tries to go back to his original family, but he is shot and wakes up. Yep. The film ended up using the "It's-all-a-dream" clich&eacute;. (SPOILERS END HERE) This is a horrid film that deserved the bad reviews that it got. Oh and don't try to defend this film by going "It's a kid's film!" Bullshit. I know it's a kid's film,but that doesn't mean it's immune from criticism. Kid's films have standards to. The fact that it's a kid's film doesn't make it OK for it to have awful jokes,a crappy plot,and offensive ethnic and cultural stereotypes. In conclusion:North is a horrid film that deserves all the bad reviews that it got.

    Just to make one thing clear before I review this: I never heard or watched this film before. I mean, I was born in the 90s, but I didn't even know this came out the same year as Disney's The Lion King, one of my personal childhood favorites. What really drew my attention to it was not only the Nostalgia Critic review, but the Siskel & Ebert review. At first, I thought it was gonna be one of those average family comedies, but given the quote from Siskel & Ebert themselves (It's junk. First class junk. It's a movie that makes me cringe even when I'm sitting here thinking about it.), I'm personally at their side now. I thought it had a creative, but somewhat sad and unrealistic premise: A boy who leaves his neglected parents and searches all over the world for better ones. It has a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Jason Alexander, and others and one of the greatest directors of all time Rob Reiner who made such great hits like Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride. But, when I watched the whole thing online, I became shocked at how unbelievably cruel and horrendous this movie is and is by far the director's embarrassing project that he had ever done in the history of filmmaking. However, I don't think it's the worse for there are some nice scenery throughout the film and I think I like the Texas song sequence sang by Reba McEntire. Apparently, those redeeming qualities are completely ruined by it's flaws especially it's lazy and cheap cop-out ending. Like I said before, it has a talented cast, but they seem to be wasted by a terrible script, unfunny one-liners, and clumsy direction from Rob Reiner. The characters are poorly conceived. I don't hate Elijah Wood, but I did find him rather obnoxious here and the music from Marc Shaiman is instantly forgettable. Even the story is thinly plotted it doesn't try what it wants to be. Overall, North isn't the worse movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible movie that needs to be avoided at all costs.

    I don't need to say how bad this movie is because Roger Ebert and Doug Walker already have done that for us. It is garbage...no it's garbage of garbage that get spewed out by more garbage and compacted. Avoid this movie at all costs. I'm dead serious. The only thing that save this movie is Dan Akyroyd and he's just portraying a Texan stereotype. This movie makes The Room look good by comparison. Save yourselves from the black void that is this movie by watching something better.
