 <sinopse>
  A big-city reporter travels to the small town where her mother has been arrested for the murder of an elderly woman that she works for as a maid.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Dolores Claiborne works as a maid for a wealthy woman in remote Maine. When she is indicted for the elderly woman's murder, Dolores' daughter Selena returns from New York, where she has become a big-shot reporter. In the course of working out the details of what has happened, as well as some shady questions from the past and Selina's troubled childhood, many difficult truths are revealed about their family's domestic strife. This is cleverly portrayed with present reality shot in cool blue tones blending seamlessly into flashbacks shot in vivid color. As small town justice relentlessly grinds forward, surprises lie in store for the viewers....

    A talented group of filmmakers take a particularly interesting Stephen King novel, one that basically amounts to one long monologue by the main character, and fleshes it out quite well, giving each of the main characters their own chance to shine. It's a long but heavily engrossing story of damaged people affected deeply by the past and living in a dreary present, and a story of the fractured relationship between a long estranged mother and daughter with differing memories of long ago events. Eventually truths are revealed and they are able to finally able to make some sort of attempt at coping. Kathy Bates, who'd performed so superbly and memorably as the villainess in the previous King adaptation "Misery", here plays a more sympathetic person, the title woman who's had to put up with a lot of garbage during her life. In the present day she stands accused of murdering her longtime employer, Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt). This brings Dolores's bitter daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) home for the first time in a while. Selena still hasn't forgiven Dolores for the past, and a weary old detective bearing a grudge (Christopher Plummer) is determined that this time he will prove Dolores to be a killer. Set on a fictional Maine island dubbed Little Tall Island, this was filmed in Canadas' province of Nova Scotia (which is close enough to Maine geographically), and there's plenty of atmosphere to be enjoyed in the presentation. The films' biggest visual hook is the way that director Taylor Hackford and director of photography Gabriel Beristain differentiate points in time, by having the '75 period be bright and sunny and well lit to having lots of overcast skies and a somber mood to permeate the '93 scenes. The tale itself is one of Kings' best, and it receives respectful treatment from Hackford and screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who with the assistance of some very good actors create a rich gallery of personalities. Bates, Leigh, and Plummer are all wonderful; David Strathairn is very much slime personified as the worthless husband / father, Parfitt is a delight as the rich society type with more heart than she likes to reveal, Ellen Muth is touching as the teen aged version of Selena, and John C. Reilly is likable as well meaning constable Frank Stamshaw. Everything is further enhanced by a haunting and emotional score composed by Danny Elfman and good visual effects; the climactic solar eclipse is well realized on film. Those King fans disappointed with the quality of some of the films based on his work need only check out or revisit this resonant gem. Dolores is one of those great King characters whom you know you'll remember. Eight out of 10.

    This is a great movie and had to watch it about 3 times in order to get all the "flashbacks" put together. These sudden changes were similar to the quality of David Lynch, but done a little better. After a few flashbacks, when Dolorles was crying in front of Vera, I began to realize that Very was telling in a quiet way, the her husband's death was no accident when the brakes failed. Vera's eyes had an indication of evil all the way through the movie. Delorles worked for Vera for 22 years and saved her money, but her husband stole it. It was never known why Vera left her $1,600,000 in her will, and that is what kept the detective going, trying to prove Delorles murdered her. This was acting at it's best, and a storyline worthy of these fine actors.

    but not an ordinary Stephen King adaptation. because great performance of Kathy Bates change everything. story about sacrifice, abuse, rude existence, silent crime, it is only slice from many existences. picture of a fight, touching, profound, dark, seductive, it is one of films who define piece by piece its public. because line between life and fiction is very fragile. because important is not the word but the rumor of silence. because each detail makes a strong building of feelings. because it is a testimony , like many others, about nuances, cruel nuances of pain. and nothing more. it is not a Stephen King but only a mirror. because victims and new version of Javert, the hole in garden and Vera, the confession on tape or the joy of meeting are crumbs of many existences far from every script.

    Okay, where do I start here? I like Stephen King (I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though the fact that I read it on a sunny beach will colour my recollections). I like Kathy Bates and John C. Reilly. And I really like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Things are looking good for this movie so. And it delivered in almost every aspect. Almost. The film relays the story of a tough woman trying to get through her bad marriage, abusive husband (both to his wife and his daughter) and her penchant for being suspected of murder not once but twice in her lifetime. Dolores (Bates) is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she works for as a maid. When her daughter Selena (Leigh) finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she returns home from New York. Not exactly to support her Mom - she is a reporter looking for a story. The fact that Dolores was a suspect in her husband's demise some 19 years earlier hasn't helped her in this particular case or in her life in general. The problem with most King adaps - is they can come across as trite and simplistic and what works on a page does not translate to the screen. There are exceptions of course - The Shining, The Dead Zone (terrific film), The Green Mile and of course The Shawshank Redemption. But for every Shawshank there is a 'Riding the Bullet' or a 'Maximum Overdrive'. Dolores Claiburne fits in the middle of these extremes. The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good (I particularly liked the way that the flashback scenes are in vivid, bright colours whereas the scenes set in the present are in cold, blue tones). Bates is another Annie Wilkes type character here and she handles it just as well. She truly is a great actress and her portrayal of being a tough cookie with a strong heart was totally believable. Leigh is as intense as she always is. Her usual good looks washed away by the cold colours used by the lens to correctly depict her character as a washed-up, drugs-laden, hard drinking, lonely, bitter, sullen young woman. She has been eaten up by all sorts of insecurities buried so deep that even she has forgotten them over the years. Yet, in some way she still blames her mother. For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera. The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order. Other than that - well worth a watch....7/10.

    In 1990 Kathy Bates delivered a memorable, Oscar-winning performance as the crazed fan Annie Wilkes in MISERY, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Five years later, once again in a King adaptation, she gave arguably an even better and more multi-faceted performance in the title role of DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a non-horror story about a woman's past and the daughter she will do anything to protect. She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of "leave me alone;" Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand. The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it: the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the "now" is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize. Running through this film is the leitmotif "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto." Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story: the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives. Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that "there's always one in every small town" kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a "victim" would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises. Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film. Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up. The adult Serena is better termed a "survivor;" she may overdo the booze and the pills, but she's still standing. Leigh is virtually flawless here. Special mention must be made of Christopher Plummer as the detective, so certain that Dolores has committed a murder that he enters the film with his mind made up. Condescending in the extreme, his final showdown, when it comes, is not with Dolores, but with Selena. And last but by no means least, the marvelous David Strathairn as Joe. Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks. Yet Strathairn somehow manages to make him rather a pathetic character; you might hate him, but you'll also pity him. This is a truly great film that was completely overlooked by the Academy. Shame on them.

    Stephen King has been my favourite author since the 70s. Many of his novels have hit the big screen and I have over a dozen of his books in my bookshelf. Dolores Claiborne was also made into a movie and when I saw it recently I was thrilled and wanted it for my DVD collection. I guess most of the audience was unsure if the protagonist Dolores Claiborne were guilty or not for quite a while, and so was her daughter Selena in the story. So there is the excitement on two levels, one can say. The strongest aspect of this movie is the female actors, especially Kathy Bates as the main character. She is very credible as the wounded, bitter - but strong Dolores, and this peculiar love/hate relationship between the snobby Vera and hard working Dolores is a great interplay between Bates and Judy Parfitt. One other great performance is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Selena - the nervous, stifled and pill eating daughter of Dolores. The screen version of this superb book has become an absolutely great movie. Kathy Bates is at her best. She has earlier said that King's novels made her a superstar and she proves it here; she shines! And with the presentation of the beautiful environments of Maine, which is almost a standard in King's novels, I was really pleased with the outcome. Something to put my finger on? Unfortunately, yes. Leigh's character became too indistinct at times, it's difficult to figure out if that was the purpose. Also the make up on the women is not very good; at times it looks artificial. but okay, But all in all, this is a very good movie based on a great book!

    Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain. Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present. A terrificly well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly. The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward. The latter unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan. 8/10

    Misery was good and it takes great skill to make us feel for a raving lunatic. But what Kathy Bates does in this film is otherworldly. I don't follow these awards shows but I hope that she was, at very least, nominated. EVERYONE involved in this film did an INCREDIBLE job. I especially loved the relationship between Dolores and Vera -and- I'm a dude. I haven't seen any of Judy Parfitt's other works but her work in this film makes me want to seek out everything she's ever appeared in. The soundtrack, pacing/ editing, the cinematography - EVERYTHING in this movie works on many different levels. I've purchased/ gifted this film at least three times now and it's easily my favorite story from Stephen King. Dolores Claiborne (film) is about perception, forgiveness and love and anyone would be a better human being for seeing it.

    Kathy Bates is the title character, a working class mother of a driven  and clearly damaged  journalist daughter who returns to her home town after fifteen years when Dolores is accused of the murder of her wealthy long-term employer. Given that Dolores was found standing over her alleged victim with a rolling pin raised above her head, the future looks bleak for her. Based on one of Stephen King's least typical novels, Dolores Claiborne is a leisurely paced study of the self-deceptions practiced by the mind in order to survive an unmentionable childhood trauma, and of how such self-delusion can push away well-meaning loved ones. In its way it's every bit a horror story as King's more typical output. Only this is the quiet horror of within, the type that can visit even the most ordinary of people. Bates is entirely believable as the no-nonsense mother who has become something of an outcast in her small Maine home-town since her alcoholic husband died after falling down a concealed well in their garden. Christopher Plummer's tenacious detective was convinced of her guilt, but she proved to be the only case out of 86 that slipped through his fingers. Now, more than fifteen years later, his determination to put right what he believes to be a mis-justice blinds him to his own impartiality. Plummer's performance is equal to Bates', and it's interesting how the story essentially paints those who have killed in a better light than those who seek to make them pay. Jennifer Jason Leigh is Dolores' daughter, a highly-strung neurotic, dependent on pills and alcohol to get her through. Her performance is OK, but the character itself is slightly too annoying  even though her mental fragility is entirely understandable. Taylor Hackford is the director. He's not generally recognised as one of Hollywood's better directors, but he had a couple of sizable hits in the 1980s and 90s. He does a good job here, keeping a talky film visually stimulating, and emphasising the link between the present and the past by seamlessly introducing brightly coloured flashbacks that emphasise the relative innocence of both Dolores and her daughter when compared to the relentlessly grey palette of the present.

    As far as the subject matter is concerned, it is very adult and I would not recommend allowing children to see it. Cinematography is excellent, but the reason every adult person should see this movie is the acting. Rarely can you assemble a cast so varied, but so capable. Every principal actor gave a riveting performance. Kathy Bates has to stand out as over and above, but every actor in this was able to convey a persona carefully cultivated but completely natural. Compelling dramatic scenes, and the little dark comedy that occurred was also skillfully performed. Heck even the background actors were great. This is also a movie crafted as a whole, rather than various scenes thrown together, like a Merchant Ivory film in that respect. Rarely can a mature audience be treated to a show of talent like this.

She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of "leave me alone;" Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand. The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it: the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the "now" is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize. Running through this film is the leitmotif "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto." Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story: the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives. Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that "there's always one in every small town" kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a "victim" would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises. Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film. Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up. The adult Serena is better termed a "survivor;" she may overdo the booze and the pills, but she's still standing. Leigh is virtually flawless here. Special mention must be made of Christopher Plummer as the detective, so certain that Dolores has committed a murder that he enters the film with his mind made up. Condescending in the extreme, his final showdown, when it comes, is not with Dolores, but with Selena. And last but by no means least, the marvelous David Strathairn as Joe. Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks. Yet Strathairn somehow manages to make him rather a pathetic character; you might hate him, but you'll also pity him. This is a truly great film that was completely overlooked by the Academy. Shame on them.

    Stephen King has been my favourite author since the 70s. Many of his novels have hit the big screen and I have over a dozen of his books in my bookshelf. Dolores Claiborne was also made into a movie and when I saw it recently I was thrilled and wanted it for my DVD collection. I guess most of the audience was unsure if the protagonist Dolores Claiborne were guilty or not for quite a while, and so was her daughter Selena in the story. So there is the excitement on two levels, one can say. The strongest aspect of this movie is the female actors, especially Kathy Bates as the main character. She is very credible as the wounded, bitter - but strong Dolores, and this peculiar love/hate relationship between the snobby Vera and hard working Dolores is a great interplay between Bates and Judy Parfitt. One other great performance is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Selena - the nervous, stifled and pill eating daughter of Dolores. The screen version of this superb book has become an absolutely great movie. Kathy Bates is at her best. She has earlier said that King's novels made her a superstar and she proves it here; she shines! And with the presentation of the beautiful environments of Maine, which is almost a standard in King's novels, I was really pleased with the outcome. Something to put my finger on? Unfortunately, yes. Leigh's character became too indistinct at times, it's difficult to figure out if that was the purpose. Also the make up on the women is not very good; at times it looks artificial. but okay, But all in all, this is a very good movie based on a great book!

    Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain. Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present. A terrificly well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly. The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward. The latter unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan. 8/10

    Misery was good and it takes great skill to make us feel for a raving lunatic. But what Kathy Bates does in this film is otherworldly. I don't follow these awards shows but I hope that she was, at very least, nominated. EVERYONE involved in this film did an INCREDIBLE job. I especially loved the relationship between Dolores and Vera -and- I'm a dude. I haven't seen any of Judy Parfitt's other works but her work in this film makes me want to seek out everything she's ever appeared in. The soundtrack, pacing/ editing, the cinematography - EVERYTHING in this movie works on many different levels. I've purchased/ gifted this film at least three times now and it's easily my favorite story from Stephen King. Dolores Claiborne (film) is about perception, forgiveness and love and anyone would be a better human being for seeing it.

    Kathy Bates is the title character, a working class mother of a driven  and clearly damaged  journalist daughter who returns to her home town after fifteen years when Dolores is accused of the murder of her wealthy long-term employer. Given that Dolores was found standing over her alleged victim with a rolling pin raised above her head, the future looks bleak for her. Based on one of Stephen King's least typical novels, Dolores Claiborne is a leisurely paced study of the self-deceptions practiced by the mind in order to survive an unmentionable childhood trauma, and of how such self-delusion can push away well-meaning loved ones. In its way it's every bit a horror story as King's more typical output. Only this is the quiet horror of within, the type that can visit even the most ordinary of people. Bates is entirely believable as the no-nonsense mother who has become something of an outcast in her small Maine home-town since her alcoholic husband died after falling down a concealed well in their garden. Christopher Plummer's tenacious detective was convinced of her guilt, but she proved to be the only case out of 86 that slipped through his fingers. Now, more than fifteen years later, his determination to put right what he believes to be a mis-justice blinds him to his own impartiality. Plummer's performance is equal to Bates', and it's interesting how the story essentially paints those who have killed in a better light than those who seek to make them pay. Jennifer Jason Leigh is Dolores' daughter, a highly-strung neurotic, dependent on pills and alcohol to get her through. Her performance is OK, but the character itself is slightly too annoying  even though her mental fragility is entirely understandable. Taylor Hackford is the director. He's not generally recognised as one of Hollywood's better directors, but he had a couple of sizable hits in the 1980s and 90s. He does a good job here, keeping a talky film visually stimulating, and emphasising the link between the present and the past by seamlessly introducing brightly coloured flashbacks that emphasise the relative innocence of both Dolores and her daughter when compared to the relentlessly grey palette of the present.

    As far as the subject matter is concerned, it is very adult and I would not recommend allowing children to see it. Cinematography is excellent, but the reason every adult person should see this movie is the acting. Rarely can you assemble a cast so varied, but so capable. Every principal actor gave a riveting performance. Kathy Bates has to stand out as over and above, but every actor in this was able to convey a persona carefully cultivated but completely natural. Compelling dramatic scenes, and the little dark comedy that occurred was also skillfully performed. Heck even the background actors were great. This is also a movie crafted as a whole, rather than various scenes thrown together, like a Merchant Ivory film in that respect. Rarely can a mature audience be treated to a show of talent like this.

    A talented group of filmmakers take a particularly interesting Stephen King novel, one that basically amounts to one long monologue by the main character, and fleshes it out quite well, giving each of the main characters their own chance to shine. It's a long but heavily engrossing story of damaged people affected deeply by the past and living in a dreary present, and a story of the fractured relationship between a long estranged mother and daughter with differing memories of long ago events. Eventually truths are revealed and they are able to finally able to make some sort of attempt at coping. Kathy Bates, who'd performed so superbly and memorably as the villainess in the previous King adaptation "Misery", here plays a more sympathetic person, the title woman who's had to put up with a lot of garbage during her life. In the present day she stands accused of murdering her longtime employer, Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt). This brings Dolores's bitter daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) home for the first time in a while. Selena still hasn't forgiven Dolores for the past, and a weary old detective bearing a grudge (Christopher Plummer) is determined that this time he will prove Dolores to be a killer. Set on a fictional Maine island dubbed Little Tall Island, this was filmed in Canadas' province of Nova Scotia (which is close enough to Maine geographically), and there's plenty of atmosphere to be enjoyed in the presentation. The films' biggest visual hook is the way that director Taylor Hackford and director of photography Gabriel Beristain differentiate points in time, by having the '75 period be bright and sunny and well lit to having lots of overcast skies and a somber mood to permeate the '93 scenes. The tale itself is one of Kings' best, and it receives respectful treatment from Hackford and screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who with the assistance of some very good actors create a rich gallery of personalities. Bates, Leigh, and Plummer are all wonderful; David Strathairn is very much slime personified as the worthless husband / father, Parfitt is a delight as the rich society type with more heart than she likes to reveal, Ellen Muth is touching as the teen aged version of Selena, and John C. Reilly is likable as well meaning constable Frank Stamshaw. Everything is further enhanced by a haunting and emotional score composed by Danny Elfman and good visual effects; the climactic solar eclipse is well realized on film. Those King fans disappointed with the quality of some of the films based on his work need only check out or revisit this resonant gem. Dolores is one of those great King characters whom you know you'll remember. Eight out of 10.

    This is a great movie and had to watch it about 3 times in order to get all the "flashbacks" put together. These sudden changes were similar to the quality of David Lynch, but done a little better. After a few flashbacks, when Dolorles was crying in front of Vera, I began to realize that Very was telling in a quiet way, the her husband's death was no accident when the brakes failed. Vera's eyes had an indication of evil all the way through the movie. Delorles worked for Vera for 22 years and saved her money, but her husband stole it. It was never known why Vera left her $1,600,000 in her will, and that is what kept the detective going, trying to prove Delorles murdered her. This was acting at it's best, and a storyline worthy of these fine actors.

    but not an ordinary Stephen King adaptation. because great performance of Kathy Bates change everything. story about sacrifice, abuse, rude existence, silent crime, it is only slice from many existences. picture of a fight, touching, profound, dark, seductive, it is one of films who define piece by piece its public. because line between life and fiction is very fragile. because important is not the word but the rumor of silence. because each detail makes a strong building of feelings. because it is a testimony , like many others, about nuances, cruel nuances of pain. and nothing more. it is not a Stephen King but only a mirror. because victims and new version of Javert, the hole in garden and Vera, the confession on tape or the joy of meeting are crumbs of many existences far from every script.

    Okay, where do I start here? I like Stephen King (I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though the fact that I read it on a sunny beach will colour my recollections). I like Kathy Bates and John C. Reilly. And I really like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Things are looking good for this movie so. And it delivered in almost every aspect. Almost. The film relays the story of a tough woman trying to get through her bad marriage, abusive husband (both to his wife and his daughter) and her penchant for being suspected of murder not once but twice in her lifetime. Dolores (Bates) is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she works for as a maid. When her daughter Selena (Leigh) finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she returns home from New York. Not exactly to support her Mom - she is a reporter looking for a story. The fact that Dolores was a suspect in her husband's demise some 19 years earlier hasn't helped her in this particular case or in her life in general. The problem with most King adaps - is they can come across as trite and simplistic and what works on a page does not translate to the screen. There are exceptions of course - The Shining, The Dead Zone (terrific film), The Green Mile and of course The Shawshank Redemption. But for every Shawshank there is a 'Riding the Bullet' or a 'Maximum Overdrive'. Dolores Claiburne fits in the middle of these extremes. The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good (I particularly liked the way that the flashback scenes are in vivid, bright colours whereas the scenes set in the present are in cold, blue tones). Bates is another Annie Wilkes type character here and she handles it just as well. She truly is a great actress and her portrayal of being a tough cookie with a strong heart was totally believable. Leigh is as intense as she always is. Her usual good looks washed away by the cold colours used by the lens to correctly depict her character as a washed-up, drugs-laden, hard drinking, lonely, bitter, sullen young woman. She has been eaten up by all sorts of insecurities buried so deep that even she has forgotten them over the years. Yet, in some way she still blames her mother. For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera. The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order. Other than that - well worth a watch....7/10.

    As far as the subject matter is concerned, it is very adult and I would not recommend allowing children to see it. Cinematography is excellent, but the reason every adult person should see this movie is the acting. Rarely can you assemble a cast so varied, but so capable. Every principal actor gave a riveting performance. Kathy Bates has to stand out as over and above, but every actor in this was able to convey a persona carefully cultivated but completely natural. Compelling dramatic scenes, and the little dark comedy that occurred was also skillfully performed. Heck even the background actors were great. This is also a movie crafted as a whole, rather than various scenes thrown together, like a Merchant Ivory film in that respect. Rarely can a mature audience be treated to a show of talent like this.

    A talented group of filmmakers take a particularly interesting Stephen King novel, one that basically amounts to one long monologue by the main character, and fleshes it out quite well, giving each of the main characters their own chance to shine. It's a long but heavily engrossing story of damaged people affected deeply by the past and living in a dreary present, and a story of the fractured relationship between a long estranged mother and daughter with differing memories of long ago events. Eventually truths are revealed and they are able to finally able to make some sort of attempt at coping. Kathy Bates, who'd performed so superbly and memorably as the villainess in the previous King adaptation "Misery", here plays a more sympathetic person, the title woman who's had to put up with a lot of garbage during her life. In the present day she stands accused of murdering her longtime employer, Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt). This brings Dolores's bitter daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) home for the first time in a while. Selena still hasn't forgiven Dolores for the past, and a weary old detective bearing a grudge (Christopher Plummer) is determined that this time he will prove Dolores to be a killer. Set on a fictional Maine island dubbed Little Tall Island, this was filmed in Canadas' province of Nova Scotia (which is close enough to Maine geographically), and there's plenty of atmosphere to be enjoyed in the presentation. The films' biggest visual hook is the way that director Taylor Hackford and director of photography Gabriel Beristain differentiate points in time, by having the '75 period be bright and sunny and well lit to having lots of overcast skies and a somber mood to permeate the '93 scenes. The tale itself is one of Kings' best, and it receives respectful treatment from Hackford and screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who with the assistance of some very good actors create a rich gallery of personalities. Bates, Leigh, and Plummer are all wonderful; David Strathairn is very much slime personified as the worthless husband / father, Parfitt is a delight as the rich society type with more heart than she likes to reveal, Ellen Muth is touching as the teen aged version of Selena, and John C. Reilly is likable as well meaning constable Frank Stamshaw. Everything is further enhanced by a haunting and emotional score composed by Danny Elfman and good visual effects; the climactic solar eclipse is well realized on film. Those King fans disappointed with the quality of some of the films based on his work need only check out or revisit this resonant gem. Dolores is one of those great King characters whom you know you'll remember. Eight out of 10.

    This is a great movie and had to watch it about 3 times in order to get all the "flashbacks" put together. These sudden changes were similar to the quality of David Lynch, but done a little better. After a few flashbacks, when Dolorles was crying in front of Vera, I began to realize that Very was telling in a quiet way, the her husband's death was no accident when the brakes failed. Vera's eyes had an indication of evil all the way through the movie. Delorles worked for Vera for 22 years and saved her money, but her husband stole it. It was never known why Vera left her $1,600,000 in her will, and that is what kept the detective going, trying to prove Delorles murdered her. This was acting at it's best, and a storyline worthy of these fine actors.

    but not an ordinary Stephen King adaptation. because great performance of Kathy Bates change everything. story about sacrifice, abuse, rude existence, silent crime, it is only slice from many existences. picture of a fight, touching, profound, dark, seductive, it is one of films who define piece by piece its public. because line between life and fiction is very fragile. because important is not the word but the rumor of silence. because each detail makes a strong building of feelings. because it is a testimony , like many others, about nuances, cruel nuances of pain. and nothing more. it is not a Stephen King but only a mirror. because victims and new version of Javert, the hole in garden and Vera, the confession on tape or the joy of meeting are crumbs of many existences far from every script.

    Okay, where do I start here? I like Stephen King (I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though the fact that I read it on a sunny beach will colour my recollections). I like Kathy Bates and John C. Reilly. And I really like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Things are looking good for this movie so. And it delivered in almost every aspect. Almost. The film relays the story of a tough woman trying to get through her bad marriage, abusive husband (both to his wife and his daughter) and her penchant for being suspected of murder not once but twice in her lifetime. Dolores (Bates) is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she works for as a maid. When her daughter Selena (Leigh) finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she returns home from New York. Not exactly to support her Mom - she is a reporter looking for a story. The fact that Dolores was a suspect in her husband's demise some 19 years earlier hasn't helped her in this particular case or in her life in general. The problem with most King adaps - is they can come across as trite and simplistic and what works on a page does not translate to the screen. There are exceptions of course - The Shining, The Dead Zone (terrific film), The Green Mile and of course The Shawshank Redemption. But for every Shawshank there is a 'Riding the Bullet' or a 'Maximum Overdrive'. Dolores Claiburne fits in the middle of these extremes. The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good (I particularly liked the way that the flashback scenes are in vivid, bright colours whereas the scenes set in the present are in cold, blue tones). Bates is another Annie Wilkes type character here and she handles it just as well. She truly is a great actress and her portrayal of being a tough cookie with a strong heart was totally believable. Leigh is as intense as she always is. Her usual good looks washed away by the cold colours used by the lens to correctly depict her character as a washed-up, drugs-laden, hard drinking, lonely, bitter, sullen young woman. She has been eaten up by all sorts of insecurities buried so deep that even she has forgotten them over the years. Yet, in some way she still blames her mother. For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera. The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order. Other than that - well worth a watch....7/10.

    In 1990 Kathy Bates delivered a memorable, Oscar-winning performance as the crazed fan Annie Wilkes in MISERY, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Five years later, once again in a King adaptation, she gave arguably an even better and more multi-faceted performance in the title role of DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a non-horror story about a woman's past and the daughter she will do anything to protect. She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of "leave me alone;" Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand. The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it: the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the "now" is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize. Running through this film is the leitmotif "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto." Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story: the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives. Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that "there's always one in every small town" kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a "victim" would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises. Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film. Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up. The adult Serena is better termed a "survivor;" she may overdo the booze and the pills, but she's still standing. Leigh is virtually flawless here. Special mention must be made of Christopher Plummer as the detective, so certain that Dolores has committed a murder that he enters the film with his mind made up. Condescending in the extreme, his final showdown, when it comes, is not with Dolores, but with Selena. And last but by no means least, the marvelous David Strathairn as Joe. Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks. Yet Strathairn somehow manages to make him rather a pathetic character; you might hate him, but you'll also pity him. This is a truly great film that was completely overlooked by the Academy. Shame on them.

    Stephen King has been my favourite author since the 70s. Many of his novels have hit the big screen and I have over a dozen of his books in my bookshelf. Dolores Claiborne was also made into a movie and when I saw it recently I was thrilled and wanted it for my DVD collection. I guess most of the audience was unsure if the protagonist Dolores Claiborne were guilty or not for quite a while, and so was her daughter Selena in the story. So there is the excitement on two levels, one can say. The strongest aspect of this movie is the female actors, especially Kathy Bates as the main character. She is very credible as the wounded, bitter - but strong Dolores, and this peculiar love/hate relationship between the snobby Vera and hard working Dolores is a great interplay between Bates and Judy Parfitt. One other great performance is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Selena - the nervous, stifled and pill eating daughter of Dolores. The screen version of this superb book has become an absolutely great movie. Kathy Bates is at her best. She has earlier said that King's novels made her a superstar and she proves it here; she shines! And with the presentation of the beautiful environments of Maine, which is almost a standard in King's novels, I was really pleased with the outcome. Something to put my finger on? Unfortunately, yes. Leigh's character became too indistinct at times, it's difficult to figure out if that was the purpose. Also the make up on the women is not very good; at times it looks artificial. but okay, But all in all, this is a very good movie based on a great book!

    Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain. Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present. A terrificly well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly. The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward. The latter unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan. 8/10

    Misery was good and it takes great skill to make us feel for a raving lunatic. But what Kathy Bates does in this film is otherworldly. I don't follow these awards shows but I hope that she was, at very least, nominated. EVERYONE involved in this film did an INCREDIBLE job. I especially loved the relationship between Dolores and Vera -and- I'm a dude. I haven't seen any of Judy Parfitt's other works but her work in this film makes me want to seek out everything she's ever appeared in. The soundtrack, pacing/ editing, the cinematography - EVERYTHING in this movie works on many different levels. I've purchased/ gifted this film at least three times now and it's easily my favorite story from Stephen King. Dolores Claiborne (film) is about perception, forgiveness and love and anyone would be a better human being for seeing it.

    Kathy Bates is the title character, a working class mother of a driven  and clearly damaged  journalist daughter who returns to her home town after fifteen years when Dolores is accused of the murder of her wealthy long-term employer. Given that Dolores was found standing over her alleged victim with a rolling pin raised above her head, the future looks bleak for her. Based on one of Stephen King's least typical novels, Dolores Claiborne is a leisurely paced study of the self-deceptions practiced by the mind in order to survive an unmentionable childhood trauma, and of how such self-delusion can push away well-meaning loved ones. In its way it's every bit a horror story as King's more typical output. Only this is the quiet horror of within, the type that can visit even the most ordinary of people. Bates is entirely believable as the no-nonsense mother who has become something of an outcast in her small Maine home-town since her alcoholic husband died after falling down a concealed well in their garden. Christopher Plummer's tenacious detective was convinced of her guilt, but she proved to be the only case out of 86 that slipped through his fingers. Now, more than fifteen years later, his determination to put right what he believes to be a mis-justice blinds him to his own impartiality. Plummer's performance is equal to Bates', and it's interesting how the story essentially paints those who have killed in a better light than those who seek to make them pay. Jennifer Jason Leigh is Dolores' daughter, a highly-strung neurotic, dependent on pills and alcohol to get her through. Her performance is OK, but the character itself is slightly too annoying  even though her mental fragility is entirely understandable. Taylor Hackford is the director. He's not generally recognised as one of Hollywood's better directors, but he had a couple of sizable hits in the 1980s and 90s. He does a good job here, keeping a talky film visually stimulating, and emphasising the link between the present and the past by seamlessly introducing brightly coloured flashbacks that emphasise the relative innocence of both Dolores and her daughter when compared to the relentlessly grey palette of the present.

Yet to call her simply a "victim" would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises. Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film. Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up. The adult Serena is better termed a "survivor;" she may overdo the booze and the pills, but she's still standing. Leigh is virtually flawless here. Special mention must be made of Christopher Plummer as the detective, so certain that Dolores has committed a murder that he enters the film with his mind made up. Condescending in the extreme, his final showdown, when it comes, is not with Dolores, but with Selena. And last but by no means least, the marvelous David Strathairn as Joe. Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks. Yet Strathairn somehow manages to make him rather a pathetic character; you might hate him, but you'll also pity him. This is a truly great film that was completely overlooked by the Academy. Shame on them.

    Stephen King has been my favourite author since the 70s. Many of his novels have hit the big screen and I have over a dozen of his books in my bookshelf. Dolores Claiborne was also made into a movie and when I saw it recently I was thrilled and wanted it for my DVD collection. I guess most of the audience was unsure if the protagonist Dolores Claiborne were guilty or not for quite a while, and so was her daughter Selena in the story. So there is the excitement on two levels, one can say. The strongest aspect of this movie is the female actors, especially Kathy Bates as the main character. She is very credible as the wounded, bitter - but strong Dolores, and this peculiar love/hate relationship between the snobby Vera and hard working Dolores is a great interplay between Bates and Judy Parfitt. One other great performance is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Selena - the nervous, stifled and pill eating daughter of Dolores. The screen version of this superb book has become an absolutely great movie. Kathy Bates is at her best. She has earlier said that King's novels made her a superstar and she proves it here; she shines! And with the presentation of the beautiful environments of Maine, which is almost a standard in King's novels, I was really pleased with the outcome. Something to put my finger on? Unfortunately, yes. Leigh's character became too indistinct at times, it's difficult to figure out if that was the purpose. Also the make up on the women is not very good; at times it looks artificial. but okay, But all in all, this is a very good movie based on a great book!

    Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain. Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present. A terrificly well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly. The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward. The latter unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan. 8/10

    Misery was good and it takes great skill to make us feel for a raving lunatic. But what Kathy Bates does in this film is otherworldly. I don't follow these awards shows but I hope that she was, at very least, nominated. EVERYONE involved in this film did an INCREDIBLE job. I especially loved the relationship between Dolores and Vera -and- I'm a dude. I haven't seen any of Judy Parfitt's other works but her work in this film makes me want to seek out everything she's ever appeared in. The soundtrack, pacing/ editing, the cinematography - EVERYTHING in this movie works on many different levels. I've purchased/ gifted this film at least three times now and it's easily my favorite story from Stephen King. Dolores Claiborne (film) is about perception, forgiveness and love and anyone would be a better human being for seeing it.

    Kathy Bates is the title character, a working class mother of a driven  and clearly damaged  journalist daughter who returns to her home town after fifteen years when Dolores is accused of the murder of her wealthy long-term employer. Given that Dolores was found standing over her alleged victim with a rolling pin raised above her head, the future looks bleak for her. Based on one of Stephen King's least typical novels, Dolores Claiborne is a leisurely paced study of the self-deceptions practiced by the mind in order to survive an unmentionable childhood trauma, and of how such self-delusion can push away well-meaning loved ones. In its way it's every bit a horror story as King's more typical output. Only this is the quiet horror of within, the type that can visit even the most ordinary of people. Bates is entirely believable as the no-nonsense mother who has become something of an outcast in her small Maine home-town since her alcoholic husband died after falling down a concealed well in their garden. Christopher Plummer's tenacious detective was convinced of her guilt, but she proved to be the only case out of 86 that slipped through his fingers. Now, more than fifteen years later, his determination to put right what he believes to be a mis-justice blinds him to his own impartiality. Plummer's performance is equal to Bates', and it's interesting how the story essentially paints those who have killed in a better light than those who seek to make them pay. Jennifer Jason Leigh is Dolores' daughter, a highly-strung neurotic, dependent on pills and alcohol to get her through. Her performance is OK, but the character itself is slightly too annoying  even though her mental fragility is entirely understandable. Taylor Hackford is the director. He's not generally recognised as one of Hollywood's better directors, but he had a couple of sizable hits in the 1980s and 90s. He does a good job here, keeping a talky film visually stimulating, and emphasising the link between the present and the past by seamlessly introducing brightly coloured flashbacks that emphasise the relative innocence of both Dolores and her daughter when compared to the relentlessly grey palette of the present.

    As far as the subject matter is concerned, it is very adult and I would not recommend allowing children to see it. Cinematography is excellent, but the reason every adult person should see this movie is the acting. Rarely can you assemble a cast so varied, but so capable. Every principal actor gave a riveting performance. Kathy Bates has to stand out as over and above, but every actor in this was able to convey a persona carefully cultivated but completely natural. Compelling dramatic scenes, and the little dark comedy that occurred was also skillfully performed. Heck even the background actors were great. This is also a movie crafted as a whole, rather than various scenes thrown together, like a Merchant Ivory film in that respect. Rarely can a mature audience be treated to a show of talent like this.

    A talented group of filmmakers take a particularly interesting Stephen King novel, one that basically amounts to one long monologue by the main character, and fleshes it out quite well, giving each of the main characters their own chance to shine. It's a long but heavily engrossing story of damaged people affected deeply by the past and living in a dreary present, and a story of the fractured relationship between a long estranged mother and daughter with differing memories of long ago events. Eventually truths are revealed and they are able to finally able to make some sort of attempt at coping. Kathy Bates, who'd performed so superbly and memorably as the villainess in the previous King adaptation "Misery", here plays a more sympathetic person, the title woman who's had to put up with a lot of garbage during her life. In the present day she stands accused of murdering her longtime employer, Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt). This brings Dolores's bitter daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) home for the first time in a while. Selena still hasn't forgiven Dolores for the past, and a weary old detective bearing a grudge (Christopher Plummer) is determined that this time he will prove Dolores to be a killer. Set on a fictional Maine island dubbed Little Tall Island, this was filmed in Canadas' province of Nova Scotia (which is close enough to Maine geographically), and there's plenty of atmosphere to be enjoyed in the presentation. The films' biggest visual hook is the way that director Taylor Hackford and director of photography Gabriel Beristain differentiate points in time, by having the '75 period be bright and sunny and well lit to having lots of overcast skies and a somber mood to permeate the '93 scenes. The tale itself is one of Kings' best, and it receives respectful treatment from Hackford and screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who with the assistance of some very good actors create a rich gallery of personalities. Bates, Leigh, and Plummer are all wonderful; David Strathairn is very much slime personified as the worthless husband / father, Parfitt is a delight as the rich society type with more heart than she likes to reveal, Ellen Muth is touching as the teen aged version of Selena, and John C. Reilly is likable as well meaning constable Frank Stamshaw. Everything is further enhanced by a haunting and emotional score composed by Danny Elfman and good visual effects; the climactic solar eclipse is well realized on film. Those King fans disappointed with the quality of some of the films based on his work need only check out or revisit this resonant gem. Dolores is one of those great King characters whom you know you'll remember. Eight out of 10.

    This is a great movie and had to watch it about 3 times in order to get all the "flashbacks" put together. These sudden changes were similar to the quality of David Lynch, but done a little better. After a few flashbacks, when Dolorles was crying in front of Vera, I began to realize that Very was telling in a quiet way, the her husband's death was no accident when the brakes failed. Vera's eyes had an indication of evil all the way through the movie. Delorles worked for Vera for 22 years and saved her money, but her husband stole it. It was never known why Vera left her $1,600,000 in her will, and that is what kept the detective going, trying to prove Delorles murdered her. This was acting at it's best, and a storyline worthy of these fine actors.

    but not an ordinary Stephen King adaptation. because great performance of Kathy Bates change everything. story about sacrifice, abuse, rude existence, silent crime, it is only slice from many existences. picture of a fight, touching, profound, dark, seductive, it is one of films who define piece by piece its public. because line between life and fiction is very fragile. because important is not the word but the rumor of silence. because each detail makes a strong building of feelings. because it is a testimony , like many others, about nuances, cruel nuances of pain. and nothing more. it is not a Stephen King but only a mirror. because victims and new version of Javert, the hole in garden and Vera, the confession on tape or the joy of meeting are crumbs of many existences far from every script.

    Okay, where do I start here? I like Stephen King (I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though the fact that I read it on a sunny beach will colour my recollections). I like Kathy Bates and John C. Reilly. And I really like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Things are looking good for this movie so. And it delivered in almost every aspect. Almost. The film relays the story of a tough woman trying to get through her bad marriage, abusive husband (both to his wife and his daughter) and her penchant for being suspected of murder not once but twice in her lifetime. Dolores (Bates) is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she works for as a maid. When her daughter Selena (Leigh) finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she returns home from New York. Not exactly to support her Mom - she is a reporter looking for a story. The fact that Dolores was a suspect in her husband's demise some 19 years earlier hasn't helped her in this particular case or in her life in general. The problem with most King adaps - is they can come across as trite and simplistic and what works on a page does not translate to the screen. There are exceptions of course - The Shining, The Dead Zone (terrific film), The Green Mile and of course The Shawshank Redemption. But for every Shawshank there is a 'Riding the Bullet' or a 'Maximum Overdrive'. Dolores Claiburne fits in the middle of these extremes. The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good (I particularly liked the way that the flashback scenes are in vivid, bright colours whereas the scenes set in the present are in cold, blue tones). Bates is another Annie Wilkes type character here and she handles it just as well. She truly is a great actress and her portrayal of being a tough cookie with a strong heart was totally believable. Leigh is as intense as she always is. Her usual good looks washed away by the cold colours used by the lens to correctly depict her character as a washed-up, drugs-laden, hard drinking, lonely, bitter, sullen young woman. She has been eaten up by all sorts of insecurities buried so deep that even she has forgotten them over the years. Yet, in some way she still blames her mother. For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera. The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order. Other than that - well worth a watch....7/10.

    In 1990 Kathy Bates delivered a memorable, Oscar-winning performance as the crazed fan Annie Wilkes in MISERY, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Five years later, once again in a King adaptation, she gave arguably an even better and more multi-faceted performance in the title role of DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a non-horror story about a woman's past and the daughter she will do anything to protect. She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of "leave me alone;" Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand. The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it: the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the "now" is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize. Running through this film is the leitmotif "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto." Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story: the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives. Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that "there's always one in every small town" kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a "victim" would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises. Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film. Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up.

Selena still hasn't forgiven Dolores for the past, and a weary old detective bearing a grudge (Christopher Plummer) is determined that this time he will prove Dolores to be a killer. Set on a fictional Maine island dubbed Little Tall Island, this was filmed in Canadas' province of Nova Scotia (which is close enough to Maine geographically), and there's plenty of atmosphere to be enjoyed in the presentation. The films' biggest visual hook is the way that director Taylor Hackford and director of photography Gabriel Beristain differentiate points in time, by having the '75 period be bright and sunny and well lit to having lots of overcast skies and a somber mood to permeate the '93 scenes. The tale itself is one of Kings' best, and it receives respectful treatment from Hackford and screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who with the assistance of some very good actors create a rich gallery of personalities. Bates, Leigh, and Plummer are all wonderful; David Strathairn is very much slime personified as the worthless husband / father, Parfitt is a delight as the rich society type with more heart than she likes to reveal, Ellen Muth is touching as the teen aged version of Selena, and John C. Reilly is likable as well meaning constable Frank Stamshaw. Everything is further enhanced by a haunting and emotional score composed by Danny Elfman and good visual effects; the climactic solar eclipse is well realized on film. Those King fans disappointed with the quality of some of the films based on his work need only check out or revisit this resonant gem. Dolores is one of those great King characters whom you know you'll remember. Eight out of 10.

    This is a great movie and had to watch it about 3 times in order to get all the "flashbacks" put together. These sudden changes were similar to the quality of David Lynch, but done a little better. After a few flashbacks, when Dolorles was crying in front of Vera, I began to realize that Very was telling in a quiet way, the her husband's death was no accident when the brakes failed. Vera's eyes had an indication of evil all the way through the movie. Delorles worked for Vera for 22 years and saved her money, but her husband stole it. It was never known why Vera left her $1,600,000 in her will, and that is what kept the detective going, trying to prove Delorles murdered her. This was acting at it's best, and a storyline worthy of these fine actors.

    but not an ordinary Stephen King adaptation. because great performance of Kathy Bates change everything. story about sacrifice, abuse, rude existence, silent crime, it is only slice from many existences. picture of a fight, touching, profound, dark, seductive, it is one of films who define piece by piece its public. because line between life and fiction is very fragile. because important is not the word but the rumor of silence. because each detail makes a strong building of feelings. because it is a testimony , like many others, about nuances, cruel nuances of pain. and nothing more. it is not a Stephen King but only a mirror. because victims and new version of Javert, the hole in garden and Vera, the confession on tape or the joy of meeting are crumbs of many existences far from every script.

    Okay, where do I start here? I like Stephen King (I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though the fact that I read it on a sunny beach will colour my recollections). I like Kathy Bates and John C. Reilly. And I really like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Things are looking good for this movie so. And it delivered in almost every aspect. Almost. The film relays the story of a tough woman trying to get through her bad marriage, abusive husband (both to his wife and his daughter) and her penchant for being suspected of murder not once but twice in her lifetime. Dolores (Bates) is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she works for as a maid. When her daughter Selena (Leigh) finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she returns home from New York. Not exactly to support her Mom - she is a reporter looking for a story. The fact that Dolores was a suspect in her husband's demise some 19 years earlier hasn't helped her in this particular case or in her life in general. The problem with most King adaps - is they can come across as trite and simplistic and what works on a page does not translate to the screen. There are exceptions of course - The Shining, The Dead Zone (terrific film), The Green Mile and of course The Shawshank Redemption. But for every Shawshank there is a 'Riding the Bullet' or a 'Maximum Overdrive'. Dolores Claiburne fits in the middle of these extremes. The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good (I particularly liked the way that the flashback scenes are in vivid, bright colours whereas the scenes set in the present are in cold, blue tones). Bates is another Annie Wilkes type character here and she handles it just as well. She truly is a great actress and her portrayal of being a tough cookie with a strong heart was totally believable. Leigh is as intense as she always is. Her usual good looks washed away by the cold colours used by the lens to correctly depict her character as a washed-up, drugs-laden, hard drinking, lonely, bitter, sullen young woman. She has been eaten up by all sorts of insecurities buried so deep that even she has forgotten them over the years. Yet, in some way she still blames her mother. For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera. The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order. Other than that - well worth a watch....7/10.

    In 1990 Kathy Bates delivered a memorable, Oscar-winning performance as the crazed fan Annie Wilkes in MISERY, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Five years later, once again in a King adaptation, she gave arguably an even better and more multi-faceted performance in the title role of DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a non-horror story about a woman's past and the daughter she will do anything to protect. She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of "leave me alone;" Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand. The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it: the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the "now" is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize. Running through this film is the leitmotif "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto." Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story: the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives. Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that "there's always one in every small town" kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a "victim" would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises. Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film. Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up. The adult Serena is better termed a "survivor;" she may overdo the booze and the pills, but she's still standing. Leigh is virtually flawless here. Special mention must be made of Christopher Plummer as the detective, so certain that Dolores has committed a murder that he enters the film with his mind made up. Condescending in the extreme, his final showdown, when it comes, is not with Dolores, but with Selena. And last but by no means least, the marvelous David Strathairn as Joe. Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks. Yet Strathairn somehow manages to make him rather a pathetic character; you might hate him, but you'll also pity him. This is a truly great film that was completely overlooked by the Academy. Shame on them.

    Stephen King has been my favourite author since the 70s. Many of his novels have hit the big screen and I have over a dozen of his books in my bookshelf. Dolores Claiborne was also made into a movie and when I saw it recently I was thrilled and wanted it for my DVD collection. I guess most of the audience was unsure if the protagonist Dolores Claiborne were guilty or not for quite a while, and so was her daughter Selena in the story. So there is the excitement on two levels, one can say. The strongest aspect of this movie is the female actors, especially Kathy Bates as the main character. She is very credible as the wounded, bitter - but strong Dolores, and this peculiar love/hate relationship between the snobby Vera and hard working Dolores is a great interplay between Bates and Judy Parfitt. One other great performance is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Selena - the nervous, stifled and pill eating daughter of Dolores. The screen version of this superb book has become an absolutely great movie. Kathy Bates is at her best. She has earlier said that King's novels made her a superstar and she proves it here; she shines! And with the presentation of the beautiful environments of Maine, which is almost a standard in King's novels, I was really pleased with the outcome. Something to put my finger on? Unfortunately, yes. Leigh's character became too indistinct at times, it's difficult to figure out if that was the purpose. Also the make up on the women is not very good; at times it looks artificial. but okay, But all in all, this is a very good movie based on a great book!

    Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain. Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present. A terrificly well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly. The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward. The latter unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan. 8/10

    Misery was good and it takes great skill to make us feel for a raving lunatic. But what Kathy Bates does in this film is otherworldly. I don't follow these awards shows but I hope that she was, at very least, nominated. EVERYONE involved in this film did an INCREDIBLE job. I especially loved the relationship between Dolores and Vera -and- I'm a dude. I haven't seen any of Judy Parfitt's other works but her work in this film makes me want to seek out everything she's ever appeared in. The soundtrack, pacing/ editing, the cinematography - EVERYTHING in this movie works on many different levels. I've purchased/ gifted this film at least three times now and it's easily my favorite story from Stephen King. Dolores Claiborne (film) is about perception, forgiveness and love and anyone would be a better human being for seeing it.

    Kathy Bates is the title character, a working class mother of a driven  and clearly damaged  journalist daughter who returns to her home town after fifteen years when Dolores is accused of the murder of her wealthy long-term employer. Given that Dolores was found standing over her alleged victim with a rolling pin raised above her head, the future looks bleak for her. Based on one of Stephen King's least typical novels, Dolores Claiborne is a leisurely paced study of the self-deceptions practiced by the mind in order to survive an unmentionable childhood trauma, and of how such self-delusion can push away well-meaning loved ones. In its way it's every bit a horror story as King's more typical output. Only this is the quiet horror of within, the type that can visit even the most ordinary of people. Bates is entirely believable as the no-nonsense mother who has become something of an outcast in her small Maine home-town since her alcoholic husband died after falling down a concealed well in their garden. Christopher Plummer's tenacious detective was convinced of her guilt, but she proved to be the only case out of 86 that slipped through his fingers. Now, more than fifteen years later, his determination to put right what he believes to be a mis-justice blinds him to his own impartiality. Plummer's performance is equal to Bates', and it's interesting how the story essentially paints those who have killed in a better light than those who seek to make them pay. Jennifer Jason Leigh is Dolores' daughter, a highly-strung neurotic, dependent on pills and alcohol to get her through. Her performance is OK, but the character itself is slightly too annoying  even though her mental fragility is entirely understandable. Taylor Hackford is the director. He's not generally recognised as one of Hollywood's better directors, but he had a couple of sizable hits in the 1980s and 90s. He does a good job here, keeping a talky film visually stimulating, and emphasising the link between the present and the past by seamlessly introducing brightly coloured flashbacks that emphasise the relative innocence of both Dolores and her daughter when compared to the relentlessly grey palette of the present.

    As far as the subject matter is concerned, it is very adult and I would not recommend allowing children to see it. Cinematography is excellent, but the reason every adult person should see this movie is the acting. Rarely can you assemble a cast so varied, but so capable. Every principal actor gave a riveting performance. Kathy Bates has to stand out as over and above, but every actor in this was able to convey a persona carefully cultivated but completely natural. Compelling dramatic scenes, and the little dark comedy that occurred was also skillfully performed. Heck even the background actors were great. This is also a movie crafted as a whole, rather than various scenes thrown together, like a Merchant Ivory film in that respect. Rarely can a mature audience be treated to a show of talent like this.

    A talented group of filmmakers take a particularly interesting Stephen King novel, one that basically amounts to one long monologue by the main character, and fleshes it out quite well, giving each of the main characters their own chance to shine. It's a long but heavily engrossing story of damaged people affected deeply by the past and living in a dreary present, and a story of the fractured relationship between a long estranged mother and daughter with differing memories of long ago events. Eventually truths are revealed and they are able to finally able to make some sort of attempt at coping. Kathy Bates, who'd performed so superbly and memorably as the villainess in the previous King adaptation "Misery", here plays a more sympathetic person, the title woman who's had to put up with a lot of garbage during her life. In the present day she stands accused of murdering her longtime employer, Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt). This brings Dolores's bitter daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) home for the first time in a while. Selena still hasn't forgiven Dolores for the past, and a weary old detective bearing a grudge (Christopher Plummer) is determined that this time he will prove Dolores to be a killer. Set on a fictional Maine island dubbed Little Tall Island, this was filmed in Canadas' province of Nova Scotia (which is close enough to Maine geographically), and there's plenty of atmosphere to be enjoyed in the presentation. The films' biggest visual hook is the way that director Taylor Hackford and director of photography Gabriel Beristain differentiate points in time, by having the '75 period be bright and sunny and well lit to having lots of overcast skies and a somber mood to permeate the '93 scenes.

Everything is further enhanced by a haunting and emotional score composed by Danny Elfman and good visual effects; the climactic solar eclipse is well realized on film.

    Stephen King has been my favourite author since the 70s. Many of his novels have hit the big screen and I have over a dozen of his books in my bookshelf. Dolores Claiborne was also made into a movie and when I saw it recently I was thrilled and wanted it for my DVD collection. I guess most of the audience was unsure if the protagonist Dolores Claiborne were guilty or not for quite a while, and so was her daughter Selena in the story. So there is the excitement on two levels, one can say. The strongest aspect of this movie is the female actors, especially Kathy Bates as the main character. She is very credible as the wounded, bitter - but strong Dolores, and this peculiar love/hate relationship between the snobby Vera and hard working Dolores is a great interplay between Bates and Judy Parfitt. One other great performance is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Selena - the nervous, stifled and pill eating daughter of Dolores. The screen version of this superb book has become an absolutely great movie. Kathy Bates is at her best. She has earlier said that King's novels made her a superstar and she proves it here; she shines! And with the presentation of the beautiful environments of Maine, which is almost a standard in King's novels, I was really pleased with the outcome. Something to put my finger on? Unfortunately, yes. Leigh's character became too indistinct at times, it's difficult to figure out if that was the purpose. Also the make up on the women is not very good; at times it looks artificial. but okay, But all in all, this is a very good movie based on a great book!

    Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain. Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present. A terrificly well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly. The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward. The latter unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan. 8/10

    Misery was good and it takes great skill to make us feel for a raving lunatic. But what Kathy Bates does in this film is otherworldly. I don't follow these awards shows but I hope that she was, at very least, nominated. EVERYONE involved in this film did an INCREDIBLE job. I especially loved the relationship between Dolores and Vera -and- I'm a dude. I haven't seen any of Judy Parfitt's other works but her work in this film makes me want to seek out everything she's ever appeared in. The soundtrack, pacing/ editing, the cinematography - EVERYTHING in this movie works on many different levels. I've purchased/ gifted this film at least three times now and it's easily my favorite story from Stephen King. Dolores Claiborne (film) is about perception, forgiveness and love and anyone would be a better human being for seeing it.

    Kathy Bates is the title character, a working class mother of a driven  and clearly damaged  journalist daughter who returns to her home town after fifteen years when Dolores is accused of the murder of her wealthy long-term employer. Given that Dolores was found standing over her alleged victim with a rolling pin raised above her head, the future looks bleak for her. Based on one of Stephen King's least typical novels, Dolores Claiborne is a leisurely paced study of the self-deceptions practiced by the mind in order to survive an unmentionable childhood trauma, and of how such self-delusion can push away well-meaning loved ones. In its way it's every bit a horror story as King's more typical output. Only this is the quiet horror of within, the type that can visit even the most ordinary of people. Bates is entirely believable as the no-nonsense mother who has become something of an outcast in her small Maine home-town since her alcoholic husband died after falling down a concealed well in their garden. Christopher Plummer's tenacious detective was convinced of her guilt, but she proved to be the only case out of 86 that slipped through his fingers. Now, more than fifteen years later, his determination to put right what he believes to be a mis-justice blinds him to his own impartiality. Plummer's performance is equal to Bates', and it's interesting how the story essentially paints those who have killed in a better light than those who seek to make them pay. Jennifer Jason Leigh is Dolores' daughter, a highly-strung neurotic, dependent on pills and alcohol to get her through. Her performance is OK, but the character itself is slightly too annoying  even though her mental fragility is entirely understandable. Taylor Hackford is the director. He's not generally recognised as one of Hollywood's better directors, but he had a couple of sizable hits in the 1980s and 90s. He does a good job here, keeping a talky film visually stimulating, and emphasising the link between the present and the past by seamlessly introducing brightly coloured flashbacks that emphasise the relative innocence of both Dolores and her daughter when compared to the relentlessly grey palette of the present.

    As far as the subject matter is concerned, it is very adult and I would not recommend allowing children to see it. Cinematography is excellent, but the reason every adult person should see this movie is the acting. Rarely can you assemble a cast so varied, but so capable. Every principal actor gave a riveting performance. Kathy Bates has to stand out as over and above, but every actor in this was able to convey a persona carefully cultivated but completely natural. Compelling dramatic scenes, and the little dark comedy that occurred was also skillfully performed. Heck even the background actors were great. This is also a movie crafted as a whole, rather than various scenes thrown together, like a Merchant Ivory film in that respect. Rarely can a mature audience be treated to a show of talent like this.

    A talented group of filmmakers take a particularly interesting Stephen King novel, one that basically amounts to one long monologue by the main character, and fleshes it out quite well, giving each of the main characters their own chance to shine. It's a long but heavily engrossing story of damaged people affected deeply by the past and living in a dreary present, and a story of the fractured relationship between a long estranged mother and daughter with differing memories of long ago events. Eventually truths are revealed and they are able to finally able to make some sort of attempt at coping. Kathy Bates, who'd performed so superbly and memorably as the villainess in the previous King adaptation "Misery", here plays a more sympathetic person, the title woman who's had to put up with a lot of garbage during her life. In the present day she stands accused of murdering her longtime employer, Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt). This brings Dolores's bitter daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) home for the first time in a while. Selena still hasn't forgiven Dolores for the past, and a weary old detective bearing a grudge (Christopher Plummer) is determined that this time he will prove Dolores to be a killer. Set on a fictional Maine island dubbed Little Tall Island, this was filmed in Canadas' province of Nova Scotia (which is close enough to Maine geographically), and there's plenty of atmosphere to be enjoyed in the presentation. The films' biggest visual hook is the way that director Taylor Hackford and director of photography Gabriel Beristain differentiate points in time, by having the '75 period be bright and sunny and well lit to having lots of overcast skies and a somber mood to permeate the '93 scenes. The tale itself is one of Kings' best, and it receives respectful treatment from Hackford and screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who with the assistance of some very good actors create a rich gallery of personalities. Bates, Leigh, and Plummer are all wonderful; David Strathairn is very much slime personified as the worthless husband / father, Parfitt is a delight as the rich society type with more heart than she likes to reveal, Ellen Muth is touching as the teen aged version of Selena, and John C. Reilly is likable as well meaning constable Frank Stamshaw. Everything is further enhanced by a haunting and emotional score composed by Danny Elfman and good visual effects; the climactic solar eclipse is well realized on film. Those King fans disappointed with the quality of some of the films based on his work need only check out or revisit this resonant gem. Dolores is one of those great King characters whom you know you'll remember. Eight out of 10.

    This is a great movie and had to watch it about 3 times in order to get all the "flashbacks" put together. These sudden changes were similar to the quality of David Lynch, but done a little better. After a few flashbacks, when Dolorles was crying in front of Vera, I began to realize that Very was telling in a quiet way, the her husband's death was no accident when the brakes failed. Vera's eyes had an indication of evil all the way through the movie. Delorles worked for Vera for 22 years and saved her money, but her husband stole it. It was never known why Vera left her $1,600,000 in her will, and that is what kept the detective going, trying to prove Delorles murdered her. This was acting at it's best, and a storyline worthy of these fine actors.

    but not an ordinary Stephen King adaptation. because great performance of Kathy Bates change everything. story about sacrifice, abuse, rude existence, silent crime, it is only slice from many existences. picture of a fight, touching, profound, dark, seductive, it is one of films who define piece by piece its public. because line between life and fiction is very fragile. because important is not the word but the rumor of silence. because each detail makes a strong building of feelings. because it is a testimony , like many others, about nuances, cruel nuances of pain. and nothing more. it is not a Stephen King but only a mirror. because victims and new version of Javert, the hole in garden and Vera, the confession on tape or the joy of meeting are crumbs of many existences far from every script.

    Okay, where do I start here? I like Stephen King (I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though the fact that I read it on a sunny beach will colour my recollections). I like Kathy Bates and John C. Reilly. And I really like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Things are looking good for this movie so. And it delivered in almost every aspect. Almost. The film relays the story of a tough woman trying to get through her bad marriage, abusive husband (both to his wife and his daughter) and her penchant for being suspected of murder not once but twice in her lifetime. Dolores (Bates) is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she works for as a maid. When her daughter Selena (Leigh) finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she returns home from New York. Not exactly to support her Mom - she is a reporter looking for a story. The fact that Dolores was a suspect in her husband's demise some 19 years earlier hasn't helped her in this particular case or in her life in general. The problem with most King adaps - is they can come across as trite and simplistic and what works on a page does not translate to the screen. There are exceptions of course - The Shining, The Dead Zone (terrific film), The Green Mile and of course The Shawshank Redemption. But for every Shawshank there is a 'Riding the Bullet' or a 'Maximum Overdrive'. Dolores Claiburne fits in the middle of these extremes. The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good (I particularly liked the way that the flashback scenes are in vivid, bright colours whereas the scenes set in the present are in cold, blue tones). Bates is another Annie Wilkes type character here and she handles it just as well. She truly is a great actress and her portrayal of being a tough cookie with a strong heart was totally believable. Leigh is as intense as she always is. Her usual good looks washed away by the cold colours used by the lens to correctly depict her character as a washed-up, drugs-laden, hard drinking, lonely, bitter, sullen young woman. She has been eaten up by all sorts of insecurities buried so deep that even she has forgotten them over the years. Yet, in some way she still blames her mother. For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera. The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order. Other than that - well worth a watch....7/10.

    In 1990 Kathy Bates delivered a memorable, Oscar-winning performance as the crazed fan Annie Wilkes in MISERY, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Five years later, once again in a King adaptation, she gave arguably an even better and more multi-faceted performance in the title role of DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a non-horror story about a woman's past and the daughter she will do anything to protect. She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of "leave me alone;" Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand. The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it: the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the "now" is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize. Running through this film is the leitmotif "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto." Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story: the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives. Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that "there's always one in every small town" kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a "victim" would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises. Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film. Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up. The adult Serena is better termed a "survivor;" she may overdo the booze and the pills, but she's still standing. Leigh is virtually flawless here. Special mention must be made of Christopher Plummer as the detective, so certain that Dolores has committed a murder that he enters the film with his mind made up. Condescending in the extreme, his final showdown, when it comes, is not with Dolores, but with Selena. And last but by no means least, the marvelous David Strathairn as Joe. Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks. Yet Strathairn somehow manages to make him rather a pathetic character; you might hate him, but you'll also pity him. This is a truly great film that was completely overlooked by the Academy. Shame on them.

These sudden changes were similar to the quality of David Lynch, but done a little better. After a few flashbacks, when Dolorles was crying in front of Vera, I began to realize that Very was telling in a quiet way, the her husband's death was no accident when the brakes failed. Vera's eyes had an indication of evil all the way through the movie. Delorles worked for Vera for 22 years and saved her money, but her husband stole it. It was never known why Vera left her $1,600,000 in her will, and that is what kept the detective going, trying to prove Delorles murdered her. This was acting at it's best, and a storyline worthy of these fine actors.

    but not an ordinary Stephen King adaptation. because great performance of Kathy Bates change everything. story about sacrifice, abuse, rude existence, silent crime, it is only slice from many existences. picture of a fight, touching, profound, dark, seductive, it is one of films who define piece by piece its public. because line between life and fiction is very fragile. because important is not the word but the rumor of silence. because each detail makes a strong building of feelings. because it is a testimony , like many others, about nuances, cruel nuances of pain. and nothing more. it is not a Stephen King but only a mirror. because victims and new version of Javert, the hole in garden and Vera, the confession on tape or the joy of meeting are crumbs of many existences far from every script.

    Okay, where do I start here? I like Stephen King (I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though the fact that I read it on a sunny beach will colour my recollections). I like Kathy Bates and John C. Reilly. And I really like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Things are looking good for this movie so. And it delivered in almost every aspect. Almost. The film relays the story of a tough woman trying to get through her bad marriage, abusive husband (both to his wife and his daughter) and her penchant for being suspected of murder not once but twice in her lifetime. Dolores (Bates) is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she works for as a maid. When her daughter Selena (Leigh) finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she returns home from New York. Not exactly to support her Mom - she is a reporter looking for a story. The fact that Dolores was a suspect in her husband's demise some 19 years earlier hasn't helped her in this particular case or in her life in general. The problem with most King adaps - is they can come across as trite and simplistic and what works on a page does not translate to the screen. There are exceptions of course - The Shining, The Dead Zone (terrific film), The Green Mile and of course The Shawshank Redemption. But for every Shawshank there is a 'Riding the Bullet' or a 'Maximum Overdrive'. Dolores Claiburne fits in the middle of these extremes. The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good (I particularly liked the way that the flashback scenes are in vivid, bright colours whereas the scenes set in the present are in cold, blue tones). Bates is another Annie Wilkes type character here and she handles it just as well. She truly is a great actress and her portrayal of being a tough cookie with a strong heart was totally believable. Leigh is as intense as she always is. Her usual good looks washed away by the cold colours used by the lens to correctly depict her character as a washed-up, drugs-laden, hard drinking, lonely, bitter, sullen young woman. She has been eaten up by all sorts of insecurities buried so deep that even she has forgotten them over the years. Yet, in some way she still blames her mother. For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera. The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order. Other than that - well worth a watch....7/10.

    In 1990 Kathy Bates delivered a memorable, Oscar-winning performance as the crazed fan Annie Wilkes in MISERY, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Five years later, once again in a King adaptation, she gave arguably an even better and more multi-faceted performance in the title role of DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a non-horror story about a woman's past and the daughter she will do anything to protect. She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of "leave me alone;" Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand. The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it: the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the "now" is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize. Running through this film is the leitmotif "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto." Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story: the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives. Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that "there's always one in every small town" kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a "victim" would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises. Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film. Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up. The adult Serena is better termed a "survivor;" she may overdo the booze and the pills, but she's still standing. Leigh is virtually flawless here. Special mention must be made of Christopher Plummer as the detective, so certain that Dolores has committed a murder that he enters the film with his mind made up. Condescending in the extreme, his final showdown, when it comes, is not with Dolores, but with Selena. And last but by no means least, the marvelous David Strathairn as Joe. Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks. Yet Strathairn somehow manages to make him rather a pathetic character; you might hate him, but you'll also pity him. This is a truly great film that was completely overlooked by the Academy. Shame on them.

    Stephen King has been my favourite author since the 70s. Many of his novels have hit the big screen and I have over a dozen of his books in my bookshelf. Dolores Claiborne was also made into a movie and when I saw it recently I was thrilled and wanted it for my DVD collection. I guess most of the audience was unsure if the protagonist Dolores Claiborne were guilty or not for quite a while, and so was her daughter Selena in the story. So there is the excitement on two levels, one can say. The strongest aspect of this movie is the female actors, especially Kathy Bates as the main character. She is very credible as the wounded, bitter - but strong Dolores, and this peculiar love/hate relationship between the snobby Vera and hard working Dolores is a great interplay between Bates and Judy Parfitt. One other great performance is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Selena - the nervous, stifled and pill eating daughter of Dolores. The screen version of this superb book has become an absolutely great movie. Kathy Bates is at her best. She has earlier said that King's novels made her a superstar and she proves it here; she shines! And with the presentation of the beautiful environments of Maine, which is almost a standard in King's novels, I was really pleased with the outcome. Something to put my finger on? Unfortunately, yes. Leigh's character became too indistinct at times, it's difficult to figure out if that was the purpose. Also the make up on the women is not very good; at times it looks artificial. but okay, But all in all, this is a very good movie based on a great book!

    Dolores Claiborne is directed by Taylor Hackford and adapted to screenplay by Tony Gilroy from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Strathairn, John C. Riley, Christopher Plummer and Judy Parfitt. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain. Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present. A terrificly well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly. The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward. The latter unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours. However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan. 8/10

    Misery was good and it takes great skill to make us feel for a raving lunatic. But what Kathy Bates does in this film is otherworldly. I don't follow these awards shows but I hope that she was, at very least, nominated. EVERYONE involved in this film did an INCREDIBLE job. I especially loved the relationship between Dolores and Vera -and- I'm a dude. I haven't seen any of Judy Parfitt's other works but her work in this film makes me want to seek out everything she's ever appeared in. The soundtrack, pacing/ editing, the cinematography - EVERYTHING in this movie works on many different levels. I've purchased/ gifted this film at least three times now and it's easily my favorite story from Stephen King. Dolores Claiborne (film) is about perception, forgiveness and love and anyone would be a better human being for seeing it.

    Kathy Bates is the title character, a working class mother of a driven  and clearly damaged  journalist daughter who returns to her home town after fifteen years when Dolores is accused of the murder of her wealthy long-term employer. Given that Dolores was found standing over her alleged victim with a rolling pin raised above her head, the future looks bleak for her. Based on one of Stephen King's least typical novels, Dolores Claiborne is a leisurely paced study of the self-deceptions practiced by the mind in order to survive an unmentionable childhood trauma, and of how such self-delusion can push away well-meaning loved ones. In its way it's every bit a horror story as King's more typical output. Only this is the quiet horror of within, the type that can visit even the most ordinary of people. Bates is entirely believable as the no-nonsense mother who has become something of an outcast in her small Maine home-town since her alcoholic husband died after falling down a concealed well in their garden. Christopher Plummer's tenacious detective was convinced of her guilt, but she proved to be the only case out of 86 that slipped through his fingers. Now, more than fifteen years later, his determination to put right what he believes to be a mis-justice blinds him to his own impartiality. Plummer's performance is equal to Bates', and it's interesting how the story essentially paints those who have killed in a better light than those who seek to make them pay. Jennifer Jason Leigh is Dolores' daughter, a highly-strung neurotic, dependent on pills and alcohol to get her through. Her performance is OK, but the character itself is slightly too annoying  even though her mental fragility is entirely understandable. Taylor Hackford is the director. He's not generally recognised as one of Hollywood's better directors, but he had a couple of sizable hits in the 1980s and 90s. He does a good job here, keeping a talky film visually stimulating, and emphasising the link between the present and the past by seamlessly introducing brightly coloured flashbacks that emphasise the relative innocence of both Dolores and her daughter when compared to the relentlessly grey palette of the present.

    As far as the subject matter is concerned, it is very adult and I would not recommend allowing children to see it. Cinematography is excellent, but the reason every adult person should see this movie is the acting. Rarely can you assemble a cast so varied, but so capable. Every principal actor gave a riveting performance. Kathy Bates has to stand out as over and above, but every actor in this was able to convey a persona carefully cultivated but completely natural. Compelling dramatic scenes, and the little dark comedy that occurred was also skillfully performed. Heck even the background actors were great. This is also a movie crafted as a whole, rather than various scenes thrown together, like a Merchant Ivory film in that respect. Rarely can a mature audience be treated to a show of talent like this.
