    Franticly looking around for a Neo-Noir to watch for a poll that was being held on the Classic Film board for the best movies of 1993,I was disappointed to find that my original choice of Neo-Noir viewing in John Dahl's Red Rock West was being sold at a too expensive price. Not giving up on tracking down a Noir from 93,I was thrilled,when after spending an hour of searching around everywhere online,I finally found a Neo-Noir that seemed to offer all of the dark delights that I had been searching for. The plot: Frustrated over his job being at a standstill and there being a huge gap between his dreams and the money in his wallet,police officer Jack Grimaldi decides to become an informant for a powerful gangster called Don Falcone,with Grimaldi's leaked details to the mob over current police investigations being exchanged for more cash than Jack has ever seen,which leads to Grimaldi deciding that the only safe place where he can safely keep this vast bundle is in a sewer drain,that is based in the back garden of the house which he lives in with his wife,Natalie. Happy over now having enough cash that allows Jack to buy whatever he and Natalie dream of,along with also being able to afford keeping a mistress/girlfriend on the side for the first time ever,Jack accepts Don's new request of helping to "get rid" of a former friend/fellow gangster of Falcone's called Mona Demarkov,who along with currently being held by police,is also being very vocal in saying that she is now bigger and more powerful than Falcone. Planning to get rid of Don's "problem' right away,Jack finds from the moment that his eyes set on Mona,that he becomes tantalised by the alluring sensual powers that she posses,which leads Grimaldi to excitingly suspect that he has finally met a Femme Fatale,who will turn out to be more deadlier than any of the "Julliets" that Grimaldi has spent his life being round. View on the film: Proving that Neo-Noirs do not just come from "a mans world",the fantastic screenplay by Hilary Henkin gives the movie a deliciously Black Comedy scar deep across both its cheeks,with Henkin showing Jack Grimaldi's (played by a wonderfully scrambled Gary Oldman) happiness over feeling the garden drain with a newly discovered flow of cash,slowly transform into an addiction,where the whole meaning of his existence lays in continuing to make his money pit go "deeper" by any means necessary. Working closely with the precise editing of Walter Murch,cinematography Datiusz Wolski and director Peter Medak shoot this terrific Neo-Noir in stylish low angles,which along with showing how "low life" the characters are,also creates a strong subtle atmosphere for the viewer that they are seeing Grimaldi's life slowly sink into the pit,which he has unintentionally dug out for himself.Along with the stylish low angles,Medak and Murch also give the film a surprisingly surreal edge by revealing the unrolling state of mind that Jack finds himself in,from having nightmares in a fairground ride,to seeing every woman that he has gone with aim a gun at him. Featuring not 1,but 3 Femme Fatale dames!,each of the actresses show a determination in making their own pointed-heel mark in being the leading dame of this Neo-Noir,with Annabella Sciorra slowly revealing a real bite as Natalie,whilst Juliette Lewis brilliantly shows Grimaldi's girlfriend/mistress Sheri finding out that she has gotten too close with sinister folk who will now not let Sheri going back to her normal life,and steaming up the screen the moment she arrives,the beautiful Lena Olin mixes a strong,erotic sensual appearance,with a psychotic,demon like laughs that leads Jack to realising how deep in his self created money pit he has sunk.

    Romeo Is Bleeding is directed by Peter Medak and written by Hilary Henkin. It stars Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis and Roy Scheider. Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress, but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov (Olin), he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone... A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics, Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neo-noir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours, it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it, that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top, where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in, a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously. The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view, he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a "hit" and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation, while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image - or a scene at a amusement park - further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen. Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5/10

    Life is a matter of not wanting too much of anything, not trying to be God or play God, not always looking for grass that you think is greener but isn't, being yourself, rolling with the punches, believing in and trusting the man upstairs, playing it fair and square, and, above all, following where love leads and not destroying it when it shows up or you feel it. Break the rules and you pay for it. You lose what's good but what you fail to appreciate because you're too dumb or greedy to know any better. Gary Oldman is nothing short of terrific in this movie, and very effective are the three women with whom he is involved: his wife (Annabella Sciorra), his waitress girl friend (Juliette Lewis), and a very twisted Russian hit woman (Lena Olin). Oldman breaks most all the rules I just mentioned, and he is the loser for it. He finds that hell is on this earth, and he says so. He falls in love with his stash of dirty cash. He sells out his job and buddies. He betrays his wife. He is greedy for more money and sex. He doesn't stick with his love. He ends up in the middle of nowhere (another hell) with a bit of hope and memories, and that's after attempted suicide (the gun was out of ammo). Gary goes for the green and loses the gold, his wife. A good woman, a loyal woman, is worth more to a man than any amount of precious jewels. So goes the proverb, and this is true. His wife is so disillusioned with him that she has lost all feeling for life. She believes in nothing. She despairs and now fears death. He has killed her hopes and dreams. She never comes backs to him. His girl friend loves him and is under the illusion he loves her. She's an honestly frustrated soul, but she'd get over it except that he ends up killing her too, not only directly but by getting involved with the Lena Olin. She's a fantastic character who gets sadistic satisfaction at betraying every man in sight, but she gets her comeuppance too, much to her surprise. It's a simple morality tale. Oldman is a dirty cop and a dirty husband and a weak and misdirected man who loses what he had. He pays for it. Despite all that, he's an enormously sympathetic character, because we all have his weaknesses. We want him to beat the odds and win, and he tries very hard to do it. We're rooting for him and ourselves and everyone else who tries, and we know we're all going to fall down to various degrees. What man might not be tempted by Lena Olin's charms, even knowing what a bitch she is and how dangerous she is? What man might not fall for Juliette Lewis offering a simple and uncomplicated love? But why Gary may have betrayed his wife for her sister or her niece, we do not know. There is no surer way to destroy a marriage than adultery. The movie is told in flashback and with voice over narration, reminding me of how Carlito's Way was done. It was effective, lending a bittersweet, sorrowful, and at times comical tone to the essentially tragic proceedings. The music score was very effective at times in its use of a jazz trumpet. In fact, it was written and played by jazz trumpet player Mark Isham. Jazz scores as in such film noirs as Elevator to the Gallows and Odds Against Tomorrow are often very effective, and this movie shows how it can be done in a neo-noir.

    Every time its May 1 or December 1, I think of this movie. It means something, it must be good to leave that kind of impression on me. When a movie sticks in your mind, even if its just one quote, for so long after you have seen it (and the last time I saw it was 3 or 4 years ago) it means it can't be bad. So thats one thing. Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Michael Wincott, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra, Will Patton and James Cromwell-all serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this so-flawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost, he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character, no? And in the end he does the right thing, but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about that-how we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us. What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean, corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her, then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well, maybe not after all. Its a movie that succeeds in pulling it all together rather well and at the same time making us stay on the edge of our seat to see whats gonna happen next. Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one, Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in, this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding. Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin, who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened, there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody, not even he, knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.

    Legend says that, after seeing this film, Bon Jovi decided not to allow their ballade "Always" to be included in it, even though it was written for the film. It's their loss. Romeo is Bleeding is one of those films you either love or hate; it's energetic, unapologetic and raw. Not subtle at all. It goes between a perfect film noir and a parody of the genre. But the best thing about it is the fact it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a story of a dirty cop and a mysterious, dangerous woman. Gary Odlman and Lena Olin are perfect in their roles, neatly over the top when situation demands it. They understand what kind of the film they're in, even if we don't get it; but everything fits so well at the end. No, it is not a serious, nostalgic film noir. Nor is a highly sexualized 90s crime drama along the lines of Basic Instinct. It's both, at the same time, and more. Some of the action - or sex - scenes will make you laugh, and at one point you might think what you're watching is pure trash. But somehow, it's part of the charm. Because even with the simple (and, dare to say, predictable) plot, this film manages to be unique and memorable.

    I was looking at blurays/dvds at Carrefour a few days ago (European version of Walmart) and I saw the DVD of Romeo Is Bleeding in the cheap DVD section. Generally these are crap films which nobody buys. It was 5.99 TL (Turkish liras). I looked at the back cover and saw that Gary Oldman, whom I think is one of the most underrated actors ever, starred in the film. I consider him to be very talented. I bought the film thinking it might be good and it was not only good, it was actually amazing. The cinematography was beautiful, Oldman and Olin were very good in their roles, the rest of the cast was also good though I think James Cromwell could have a bigger part. The storyline was good and I was not bored for a second, I was interested in what was going to happen next throughout the movie so the pacing was well adjusted. The film is a film noir set in the 90s with a sort of New York we have not seen before. Some people might claim the psycho woman character was unrealistic but I do not think so, many criminals are not like normal people, and she's a prime example. In short, this is one of the most unknown great films that can be bought for a low price. It is underrated and not known by many people, but it is still a classic crime thriller.

    There are a lot of actors who made their initial claim to fame through their "dangerous" persona, Tim Roth, Nicolas Cage, Mickey Rourke, Jack Nicholson and in more recent years Colin Farrell, to which I say puh-leeze. Ladies and gents I give you Gary Oldman -True Romance, Leon, Immortal Beloved, even Air Force One, he plays a crazy better than almost anyone. In Romeo Is Bleeding Oldman is out-crazied by Lena Olin. Big time. Oldman plays Jack, a corrupt cop who takes money from organized crime by selling out informants, witnesses and such. He tells them where the guy is, they whack him. Jack also juggles a wife, a girlfriend and a roving eye, which leads him to get caught by the FBI trying to get it on with a Russian hitwoman he is supposed to be handing over, (enter Lena) as Mona. Mona gets away, the underworld (headed by Roy Scheider) is p****d, and tells Jack to finish the job personally, or else. Jack was already a little stressed but this tweaks it up a notch, what with his girlfriend and wife both threatening to leave, and when he finds Mona she counter offers with a payment to tell the bad guys that she has been killed, assuming by the time they work out they were duped she will have left the country. The basic lesson here is don't trust anyone, by the time Jack sorts himself out he has Mona and the mob trying to kill him, he loses a couple of toes to the latter at one stage, and over a few meetings works out than Mona is absolutely nuts, and will do anything necessary to get what she wants, and I mean anything. Everything about this film is just a bit off kilter, meaning that at times it can feel quite surreal. The tone is always kept dark and if anything it is perhaps a bit of an update on the traditional noir films of the early years of Hollywood, only with a twist. I did like this film, even though it took a while getting where it was going, I guess sometimes you can over-twist things. I have heard some people worship this film and place it right at the top of their all time lists, and they have every right to, though having seen it a couple times I just don't get it personally. What I put that down to is I think everyone has a phase where they decide what it is that they actually like, as opposed to what they think they should like, believe it or not some never work this out. This in large part explains Gwen Stefani's mainstream success. During the immediate period after you make your decision you upgrade anything a couple points, for me this caused me to elevate movies like "Tremors" and "Deep Cover", and I suppose for some "Romeo is Bleeding" is their example. Final Rating  7 / 10. Watch if only Lena Olin going so far Over The Top that she creates a new level of overacting. (I call it "Lithgow-ing". ) If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com

    I'm not a stupid person, but frankly I don't understand Romeo is Bleeding. I'd like to think that it is the film which is problematic not me. Romeo is not merely bleeding, he is falling apart. What we have here is a classic case, of a film that tries to be more than it is capable of. It feels convoluted, unbelievable, and unfortunately is not very involving. NYPD Sargent Jack Grimaldi has been doing petty jobs for a mob which the department has been going after. He gets a few thousand dollars with every job, and he adds it to a pile hidden in his backyard. His latest job is to take out the Russian assassin, who he just arrested the other day. While in his custody she offers him an even better deal with more money. But first , he has to fake her death, getting him clean with the boss, and then he must get out of the mob gig before he gets caught. Things are getting tougher with each passing moment. The whole thing doesn't come together very well. Romeo is Bleeding would have been better with the less is more approach. Some details like Jack's involvement with three different women, and the stiff necked feds (who only appear twice) prove fairly useless to the story. Their screen time may have been a bit more worth while, if anyone bothered to act well, too bad no one does; no one except Roy Scheider. This guy has never done a bad movie, and his one talky scene is actually a pretty good one, certainly the best in the film. Him aside, there are two kinds of performances in Romeo is Bleeding; there are the lazy ones, and there are the over-done ones. Gary Oldman is a case of the former. This is not the kind of person we end up caring for. The ending, which is supposed to earn our sympathy instead earns our impatience. It has an overwritten melodramatic monologue which drags on way too long. Romeo is Bleeding delivers the classic 'noir' first person narration. If it had done a better job of explaining the story as it unfolded rather than the tiny little voice in Oldman's head, I think that would have also been an improvement on the film When all is said and done, Romeo is Bleeding qualifies as a swing and a miss. It is in desperate need of a rewrite, an energy boost, and some brains. I'll have to say skip this one.

    If you're looking for realism and seriousness don't watch it. Always complaining and whining about over-acting don't watch this. Go see Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant instead if you can handle the realism in that movie at least, has a bit of over-acting too though. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin and Roy Scheider are absolutely brilliant and super-cool in this movie. Beautiful entertaining piece of artwork. Extremely violent and very sexy. I've read a few negative reviews about this movie. I suppose those people can't relate to this. Maybe they never crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed and never as a result of this experienced the inescapable downward spiral leading straight to oblivion. Lucky them.

    I had to comment because I simply can not believe all of the lower rating numbers this film has received; it's one of my very favorite films of the 1990s. This film is not perfect, as stated by other people, Roy Schieder is terribly miscast (although I was more distracted by his obvious face-lift). Otherwise, this film rocks. The rest of the cast is simply superb and I don't know how in the world Gary Oldman, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra and Lena Olin were not nominated for the Academy Award in their respective categories. Hilary Henkin has written a tight and compelling script and it's directed with sheer brilliance. Gary Oldmaan is one of the best actors of his generation and nowhere is that comment more obvious than in his performance in this film. As Jack Grimaldi, his New York accent is spot-on. He creates a character which most people will recognize somewhere in his/her life and delivers it with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her performance is funny, touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra is glorious as Jack's earth-mother wife. Everything about her performance rings true. But, it's impossible to even find words to describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful, sexy, tough, cold-hearted, vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years, and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't even nominated! When this film failed to get any nominations at all was the time I stopped watching the Oscars. Rent it. You'll never forget it.

While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen. Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5/10

    Life is a matter of not wanting too much of anything, not trying to be God or play God, not always looking for grass that you think is greener but isn't, being yourself, rolling with the punches, believing in and trusting the man upstairs, playing it fair and square, and, above all, following where love leads and not destroying it when it shows up or you feel it. Break the rules and you pay for it. You lose what's good but what you fail to appreciate because you're too dumb or greedy to know any better. Gary Oldman is nothing short of terrific in this movie, and very effective are the three women with whom he is involved: his wife (Annabella Sciorra), his waitress girl friend (Juliette Lewis), and a very twisted Russian hit woman (Lena Olin). Oldman breaks most all the rules I just mentioned, and he is the loser for it. He finds that hell is on this earth, and he says so. He falls in love with his stash of dirty cash. He sells out his job and buddies. He betrays his wife. He is greedy for more money and sex. He doesn't stick with his love. He ends up in the middle of nowhere (another hell) with a bit of hope and memories, and that's after attempted suicide (the gun was out of ammo). Gary goes for the green and loses the gold, his wife. A good woman, a loyal woman, is worth more to a man than any amount of precious jewels. So goes the proverb, and this is true. His wife is so disillusioned with him that she has lost all feeling for life. She believes in nothing. She despairs and now fears death. He has killed her hopes and dreams. She never comes backs to him. His girl friend loves him and is under the illusion he loves her. She's an honestly frustrated soul, but she'd get over it except that he ends up killing her too, not only directly but by getting involved with the Lena Olin. She's a fantastic character who gets sadistic satisfaction at betraying every man in sight, but she gets her comeuppance too, much to her surprise. It's a simple morality tale. Oldman is a dirty cop and a dirty husband and a weak and misdirected man who loses what he had. He pays for it. Despite all that, he's an enormously sympathetic character, because we all have his weaknesses. We want him to beat the odds and win, and he tries very hard to do it. We're rooting for him and ourselves and everyone else who tries, and we know we're all going to fall down to various degrees. What man might not be tempted by Lena Olin's charms, even knowing what a bitch she is and how dangerous she is? What man might not fall for Juliette Lewis offering a simple and uncomplicated love? But why Gary may have betrayed his wife for her sister or her niece, we do not know. There is no surer way to destroy a marriage than adultery. The movie is told in flashback and with voice over narration, reminding me of how Carlito's Way was done. It was effective, lending a bittersweet, sorrowful, and at times comical tone to the essentially tragic proceedings. The music score was very effective at times in its use of a jazz trumpet. In fact, it was written and played by jazz trumpet player Mark Isham. Jazz scores as in such film noirs as Elevator to the Gallows and Odds Against Tomorrow are often very effective, and this movie shows how it can be done in a neo-noir.

    Every time its May 1 or December 1, I think of this movie. It means something, it must be good to leave that kind of impression on me. When a movie sticks in your mind, even if its just one quote, for so long after you have seen it (and the last time I saw it was 3 or 4 years ago) it means it can't be bad. So thats one thing. Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Michael Wincott, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra, Will Patton and James Cromwell-all serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this so-flawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost, he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character, no? And in the end he does the right thing, but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about that-how we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us. What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean, corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her, then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well, maybe not after all. Its a movie that succeeds in pulling it all together rather well and at the same time making us stay on the edge of our seat to see whats gonna happen next. Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one, Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in, this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding. Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin, who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened, there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody, not even he, knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.

    Legend says that, after seeing this film, Bon Jovi decided not to allow their ballade "Always" to be included in it, even though it was written for the film. It's their loss. Romeo is Bleeding is one of those films you either love or hate; it's energetic, unapologetic and raw. Not subtle at all. It goes between a perfect film noir and a parody of the genre. But the best thing about it is the fact it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a story of a dirty cop and a mysterious, dangerous woman. Gary Odlman and Lena Olin are perfect in their roles, neatly over the top when situation demands it. They understand what kind of the film they're in, even if we don't get it; but everything fits so well at the end. No, it is not a serious, nostalgic film noir. Nor is a highly sexualized 90s crime drama along the lines of Basic Instinct. It's both, at the same time, and more. Some of the action - or sex - scenes will make you laugh, and at one point you might think what you're watching is pure trash. But somehow, it's part of the charm. Because even with the simple (and, dare to say, predictable) plot, this film manages to be unique and memorable.

    I was looking at blurays/dvds at Carrefour a few days ago (European version of Walmart) and I saw the DVD of Romeo Is Bleeding in the cheap DVD section. Generally these are crap films which nobody buys. It was 5.99 TL (Turkish liras). I looked at the back cover and saw that Gary Oldman, whom I think is one of the most underrated actors ever, starred in the film. I consider him to be very talented. I bought the film thinking it might be good and it was not only good, it was actually amazing. The cinematography was beautiful, Oldman and Olin were very good in their roles, the rest of the cast was also good though I think James Cromwell could have a bigger part. The storyline was good and I was not bored for a second, I was interested in what was going to happen next throughout the movie so the pacing was well adjusted. The film is a film noir set in the 90s with a sort of New York we have not seen before. Some people might claim the psycho woman character was unrealistic but I do not think so, many criminals are not like normal people, and she's a prime example. In short, this is one of the most unknown great films that can be bought for a low price. It is underrated and not known by many people, but it is still a classic crime thriller.

    There are a lot of actors who made their initial claim to fame through their "dangerous" persona, Tim Roth, Nicolas Cage, Mickey Rourke, Jack Nicholson and in more recent years Colin Farrell, to which I say puh-leeze. Ladies and gents I give you Gary Oldman -True Romance, Leon, Immortal Beloved, even Air Force One, he plays a crazy better than almost anyone. In Romeo Is Bleeding Oldman is out-crazied by Lena Olin. Big time. Oldman plays Jack, a corrupt cop who takes money from organized crime by selling out informants, witnesses and such. He tells them where the guy is, they whack him. Jack also juggles a wife, a girlfriend and a roving eye, which leads him to get caught by the FBI trying to get it on with a Russian hitwoman he is supposed to be handing over, (enter Lena) as Mona. Mona gets away, the underworld (headed by Roy Scheider) is p****d, and tells Jack to finish the job personally, or else. Jack was already a little stressed but this tweaks it up a notch, what with his girlfriend and wife both threatening to leave, and when he finds Mona she counter offers with a payment to tell the bad guys that she has been killed, assuming by the time they work out they were duped she will have left the country. The basic lesson here is don't trust anyone, by the time Jack sorts himself out he has Mona and the mob trying to kill him, he loses a couple of toes to the latter at one stage, and over a few meetings works out than Mona is absolutely nuts, and will do anything necessary to get what she wants, and I mean anything. Everything about this film is just a bit off kilter, meaning that at times it can feel quite surreal. The tone is always kept dark and if anything it is perhaps a bit of an update on the traditional noir films of the early years of Hollywood, only with a twist. I did like this film, even though it took a while getting where it was going, I guess sometimes you can over-twist things. I have heard some people worship this film and place it right at the top of their all time lists, and they have every right to, though having seen it a couple times I just don't get it personally. What I put that down to is I think everyone has a phase where they decide what it is that they actually like, as opposed to what they think they should like, believe it or not some never work this out. This in large part explains Gwen Stefani's mainstream success. During the immediate period after you make your decision you upgrade anything a couple points, for me this caused me to elevate movies like "Tremors" and "Deep Cover", and I suppose for some "Romeo is Bleeding" is their example. Final Rating  7 / 10. Watch if only Lena Olin going so far Over The Top that she creates a new level of overacting. (I call it "Lithgow-ing". ) If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com

    I'm not a stupid person, but frankly I don't understand Romeo is Bleeding. I'd like to think that it is the film which is problematic not me. Romeo is not merely bleeding, he is falling apart. What we have here is a classic case, of a film that tries to be more than it is capable of. It feels convoluted, unbelievable, and unfortunately is not very involving. NYPD Sargent Jack Grimaldi has been doing petty jobs for a mob which the department has been going after. He gets a few thousand dollars with every job, and he adds it to a pile hidden in his backyard. His latest job is to take out the Russian assassin, who he just arrested the other day. While in his custody she offers him an even better deal with more money. But first , he has to fake her death, getting him clean with the boss, and then he must get out of the mob gig before he gets caught. Things are getting tougher with each passing moment. The whole thing doesn't come together very well. Romeo is Bleeding would have been better with the less is more approach. Some details like Jack's involvement with three different women, and the stiff necked feds (who only appear twice) prove fairly useless to the story. Their screen time may have been a bit more worth while, if anyone bothered to act well, too bad no one does; no one except Roy Scheider. This guy has never done a bad movie, and his one talky scene is actually a pretty good one, certainly the best in the film. Him aside, there are two kinds of performances in Romeo is Bleeding; there are the lazy ones, and there are the over-done ones. Gary Oldman is a case of the former. This is not the kind of person we end up caring for. The ending, which is supposed to earn our sympathy instead earns our impatience. It has an overwritten melodramatic monologue which drags on way too long. Romeo is Bleeding delivers the classic 'noir' first person narration. If it had done a better job of explaining the story as it unfolded rather than the tiny little voice in Oldman's head, I think that would have also been an improvement on the film When all is said and done, Romeo is Bleeding qualifies as a swing and a miss. It is in desperate need of a rewrite, an energy boost, and some brains. I'll have to say skip this one.

    If you're looking for realism and seriousness don't watch it. Always complaining and whining about over-acting don't watch this. Go see Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant instead if you can handle the realism in that movie at least, has a bit of over-acting too though. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin and Roy Scheider are absolutely brilliant and super-cool in this movie. Beautiful entertaining piece of artwork. Extremely violent and very sexy. I've read a few negative reviews about this movie. I suppose those people can't relate to this. Maybe they never crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed and never as a result of this experienced the inescapable downward spiral leading straight to oblivion. Lucky them.

    I had to comment because I simply can not believe all of the lower rating numbers this film has received; it's one of my very favorite films of the 1990s. This film is not perfect, as stated by other people, Roy Schieder is terribly miscast (although I was more distracted by his obvious face-lift). Otherwise, this film rocks. The rest of the cast is simply superb and I don't know how in the world Gary Oldman, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra and Lena Olin were not nominated for the Academy Award in their respective categories. Hilary Henkin has written a tight and compelling script and it's directed with sheer brilliance. Gary Oldmaan is one of the best actors of his generation and nowhere is that comment more obvious than in his performance in this film. As Jack Grimaldi, his New York accent is spot-on. He creates a character which most people will recognize somewhere in his/her life and delivers it with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her performance is funny, touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra is glorious as Jack's earth-mother wife. Everything about her performance rings true. But, it's impossible to even find words to describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful, sexy, tough, cold-hearted, vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years, and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't even nominated! When this film failed to get any nominations at all was the time I stopped watching the Oscars. Rent it. You'll never forget it.

    Franticly looking around for a Neo-Noir to watch for a poll that was being held on the Classic Film board for the best movies of 1993,I was disappointed to find that my original choice of Neo-Noir viewing in John Dahl's Red Rock West was being sold at a too expensive price. Not giving up on tracking down a Noir from 93,I was thrilled,when after spending an hour of searching around everywhere online,I finally found a Neo-Noir that seemed to offer all of the dark delights that I had been searching for. The plot: Frustrated over his job being at a standstill and there being a huge gap between his dreams and the money in his wallet,police officer Jack Grimaldi decides to become an informant for a powerful gangster called Don Falcone,with Grimaldi's leaked details to the mob over current police investigations being exchanged for more cash than Jack has ever seen,which leads to Grimaldi deciding that the only safe place where he can safely keep this vast bundle is in a sewer drain,that is based in the back garden of the house which he lives in with his wife,Natalie. Happy over now having enough cash that allows Jack to buy whatever he and Natalie dream of,along with also being able to afford keeping a mistress/girlfriend on the side for the first time ever,Jack accepts Don's new request of helping to "get rid" of a former friend/fellow gangster of Falcone's called Mona Demarkov,who along with currently being held by police,is also being very vocal in saying that she is now bigger and more powerful than Falcone. Planning to get rid of Don's "problem' right away,Jack finds from the moment that his eyes set on Mona,that he becomes tantalised by the alluring sensual powers that she posses,which leads Grimaldi to excitingly suspect that he has finally met a Femme Fatale,who will turn out to be more deadlier than any of the "Julliets" that Grimaldi has spent his life being round. View on the film: Proving that Neo-Noirs do not just come from "a mans world",the fantastic screenplay by Hilary Henkin gives the movie a deliciously Black Comedy scar deep across both its cheeks,with Henkin showing Jack Grimaldi's (played by a wonderfully scrambled Gary Oldman) happiness over feeling the garden drain with a newly discovered flow of cash,slowly transform into an addiction,where the whole meaning of his existence lays in continuing to make his money pit go "deeper" by any means necessary. Working closely with the precise editing of Walter Murch,cinematography Datiusz Wolski and director Peter Medak shoot this terrific Neo-Noir in stylish low angles,which along with showing how "low life" the characters are,also creates a strong subtle atmosphere for the viewer that they are seeing Grimaldi's life slowly sink into the pit,which he has unintentionally dug out for himself.Along with the stylish low angles,Medak and Murch also give the film a surprisingly surreal edge by revealing the unrolling state of mind that Jack finds himself in,from having nightmares in a fairground ride,to seeing every woman that he has gone with aim a gun at him. Featuring not 1,but 3 Femme Fatale dames!,each of the actresses show a determination in making their own pointed-heel mark in being the leading dame of this Neo-Noir,with Annabella Sciorra slowly revealing a real bite as Natalie,whilst Juliette Lewis brilliantly shows Grimaldi's girlfriend/mistress Sheri finding out that she has gotten too close with sinister folk who will now not let Sheri going back to her normal life,and steaming up the screen the moment she arrives,the beautiful Lena Olin mixes a strong,erotic sensual appearance,with a psychotic,demon like laughs that leads Jack to realising how deep in his self created money pit he has sunk.

    Romeo Is Bleeding is directed by Peter Medak and written by Hilary Henkin. It stars Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis and Roy Scheider. Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress, but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov (Olin), he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone... A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics, Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neo-noir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours, it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it, that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top, where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in, a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously. The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view, he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a "hit" and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation, while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image - or a scene at a amusement park - further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen. Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5/10

But the best thing about it is the fact it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a story of a dirty cop and a mysterious, dangerous woman. Gary Odlman and Lena Olin are perfect in their roles, neatly over the top when situation demands it. They understand what kind of the film they're in, even if we don't get it; but everything fits so well at the end. No, it is not a serious, nostalgic film noir. Nor is a highly sexualized 90s crime drama along the lines of Basic Instinct. It's both, at the same time, and more. Some of the action - or sex - scenes will make you laugh, and at one point you might think what you're watching is pure trash. But somehow, it's part of the charm. Because even with the simple (and, dare to say, predictable) plot, this film manages to be unique and memorable.

    I was looking at blurays/dvds at Carrefour a few days ago (European version of Walmart) and I saw the DVD of Romeo Is Bleeding in the cheap DVD section. Generally these are crap films which nobody buys. It was 5.99 TL (Turkish liras). I looked at the back cover and saw that Gary Oldman, whom I think is one of the most underrated actors ever, starred in the film. I consider him to be very talented. I bought the film thinking it might be good and it was not only good, it was actually amazing. The cinematography was beautiful, Oldman and Olin were very good in their roles, the rest of the cast was also good though I think James Cromwell could have a bigger part. The storyline was good and I was not bored for a second, I was interested in what was going to happen next throughout the movie so the pacing was well adjusted. The film is a film noir set in the 90s with a sort of New York we have not seen before. Some people might claim the psycho woman character was unrealistic but I do not think so, many criminals are not like normal people, and she's a prime example. In short, this is one of the most unknown great films that can be bought for a low price. It is underrated and not known by many people, but it is still a classic crime thriller.

    There are a lot of actors who made their initial claim to fame through their "dangerous" persona, Tim Roth, Nicolas Cage, Mickey Rourke, Jack Nicholson and in more recent years Colin Farrell, to which I say puh-leeze. Ladies and gents I give you Gary Oldman -True Romance, Leon, Immortal Beloved, even Air Force One, he plays a crazy better than almost anyone. In Romeo Is Bleeding Oldman is out-crazied by Lena Olin. Big time. Oldman plays Jack, a corrupt cop who takes money from organized crime by selling out informants, witnesses and such. He tells them where the guy is, they whack him. Jack also juggles a wife, a girlfriend and a roving eye, which leads him to get caught by the FBI trying to get it on with a Russian hitwoman he is supposed to be handing over, (enter Lena) as Mona. Mona gets away, the underworld (headed by Roy Scheider) is p****d, and tells Jack to finish the job personally, or else. Jack was already a little stressed but this tweaks it up a notch, what with his girlfriend and wife both threatening to leave, and when he finds Mona she counter offers with a payment to tell the bad guys that she has been killed, assuming by the time they work out they were duped she will have left the country. The basic lesson here is don't trust anyone, by the time Jack sorts himself out he has Mona and the mob trying to kill him, he loses a couple of toes to the latter at one stage, and over a few meetings works out than Mona is absolutely nuts, and will do anything necessary to get what she wants, and I mean anything. Everything about this film is just a bit off kilter, meaning that at times it can feel quite surreal. The tone is always kept dark and if anything it is perhaps a bit of an update on the traditional noir films of the early years of Hollywood, only with a twist. I did like this film, even though it took a while getting where it was going, I guess sometimes you can over-twist things. I have heard some people worship this film and place it right at the top of their all time lists, and they have every right to, though having seen it a couple times I just don't get it personally. What I put that down to is I think everyone has a phase where they decide what it is that they actually like, as opposed to what they think they should like, believe it or not some never work this out. This in large part explains Gwen Stefani's mainstream success. During the immediate period after you make your decision you upgrade anything a couple points, for me this caused me to elevate movies like "Tremors" and "Deep Cover", and I suppose for some "Romeo is Bleeding" is their example. Final Rating  7 / 10. Watch if only Lena Olin going so far Over The Top that she creates a new level of overacting. (I call it "Lithgow-ing". ) If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com

    I'm not a stupid person, but frankly I don't understand Romeo is Bleeding. I'd like to think that it is the film which is problematic not me. Romeo is not merely bleeding, he is falling apart. What we have here is a classic case, of a film that tries to be more than it is capable of. It feels convoluted, unbelievable, and unfortunately is not very involving. NYPD Sargent Jack Grimaldi has been doing petty jobs for a mob which the department has been going after. He gets a few thousand dollars with every job, and he adds it to a pile hidden in his backyard. His latest job is to take out the Russian assassin, who he just arrested the other day. While in his custody she offers him an even better deal with more money. But first , he has to fake her death, getting him clean with the boss, and then he must get out of the mob gig before he gets caught. Things are getting tougher with each passing moment. The whole thing doesn't come together very well. Romeo is Bleeding would have been better with the less is more approach. Some details like Jack's involvement with three different women, and the stiff necked feds (who only appear twice) prove fairly useless to the story. Their screen time may have been a bit more worth while, if anyone bothered to act well, too bad no one does; no one except Roy Scheider. This guy has never done a bad movie, and his one talky scene is actually a pretty good one, certainly the best in the film. Him aside, there are two kinds of performances in Romeo is Bleeding; there are the lazy ones, and there are the over-done ones. Gary Oldman is a case of the former. This is not the kind of person we end up caring for. The ending, which is supposed to earn our sympathy instead earns our impatience. It has an overwritten melodramatic monologue which drags on way too long. Romeo is Bleeding delivers the classic 'noir' first person narration. If it had done a better job of explaining the story as it unfolded rather than the tiny little voice in Oldman's head, I think that would have also been an improvement on the film When all is said and done, Romeo is Bleeding qualifies as a swing and a miss. It is in desperate need of a rewrite, an energy boost, and some brains. I'll have to say skip this one.

    If you're looking for realism and seriousness don't watch it. Always complaining and whining about over-acting don't watch this. Go see Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant instead if you can handle the realism in that movie at least, has a bit of over-acting too though. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin and Roy Scheider are absolutely brilliant and super-cool in this movie. Beautiful entertaining piece of artwork. Extremely violent and very sexy. I've read a few negative reviews about this movie. I suppose those people can't relate to this. Maybe they never crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed and never as a result of this experienced the inescapable downward spiral leading straight to oblivion. Lucky them.

    I had to comment because I simply can not believe all of the lower rating numbers this film has received; it's one of my very favorite films of the 1990s. This film is not perfect, as stated by other people, Roy Schieder is terribly miscast (although I was more distracted by his obvious face-lift). Otherwise, this film rocks. The rest of the cast is simply superb and I don't know how in the world Gary Oldman, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra and Lena Olin were not nominated for the Academy Award in their respective categories. Hilary Henkin has written a tight and compelling script and it's directed with sheer brilliance. Gary Oldmaan is one of the best actors of his generation and nowhere is that comment more obvious than in his performance in this film. As Jack Grimaldi, his New York accent is spot-on. He creates a character which most people will recognize somewhere in his/her life and delivers it with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her performance is funny, touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra is glorious as Jack's earth-mother wife. Everything about her performance rings true. But, it's impossible to even find words to describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful, sexy, tough, cold-hearted, vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years, and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't even nominated! When this film failed to get any nominations at all was the time I stopped watching the Oscars. Rent it. You'll never forget it.

    Franticly looking around for a Neo-Noir to watch for a poll that was being held on the Classic Film board for the best movies of 1993,I was disappointed to find that my original choice of Neo-Noir viewing in John Dahl's Red Rock West was being sold at a too expensive price. Not giving up on tracking down a Noir from 93,I was thrilled,when after spending an hour of searching around everywhere online,I finally found a Neo-Noir that seemed to offer all of the dark delights that I had been searching for. The plot: Frustrated over his job being at a standstill and there being a huge gap between his dreams and the money in his wallet,police officer Jack Grimaldi decides to become an informant for a powerful gangster called Don Falcone,with Grimaldi's leaked details to the mob over current police investigations being exchanged for more cash than Jack has ever seen,which leads to Grimaldi deciding that the only safe place where he can safely keep this vast bundle is in a sewer drain,that is based in the back garden of the house which he lives in with his wife,Natalie. Happy over now having enough cash that allows Jack to buy whatever he and Natalie dream of,along with also being able to afford keeping a mistress/girlfriend on the side for the first time ever,Jack accepts Don's new request of helping to "get rid" of a former friend/fellow gangster of Falcone's called Mona Demarkov,who along with currently being held by police,is also being very vocal in saying that she is now bigger and more powerful than Falcone. Planning to get rid of Don's "problem' right away,Jack finds from the moment that his eyes set on Mona,that he becomes tantalised by the alluring sensual powers that she posses,which leads Grimaldi to excitingly suspect that he has finally met a Femme Fatale,who will turn out to be more deadlier than any of the "Julliets" that Grimaldi has spent his life being round. View on the film: Proving that Neo-Noirs do not just come from "a mans world",the fantastic screenplay by Hilary Henkin gives the movie a deliciously Black Comedy scar deep across both its cheeks,with Henkin showing Jack Grimaldi's (played by a wonderfully scrambled Gary Oldman) happiness over feeling the garden drain with a newly discovered flow of cash,slowly transform into an addiction,where the whole meaning of his existence lays in continuing to make his money pit go "deeper" by any means necessary. Working closely with the precise editing of Walter Murch,cinematography Datiusz Wolski and director Peter Medak shoot this terrific Neo-Noir in stylish low angles,which along with showing how "low life" the characters are,also creates a strong subtle atmosphere for the viewer that they are seeing Grimaldi's life slowly sink into the pit,which he has unintentionally dug out for himself.Along with the stylish low angles,Medak and Murch also give the film a surprisingly surreal edge by revealing the unrolling state of mind that Jack finds himself in,from having nightmares in a fairground ride,to seeing every woman that he has gone with aim a gun at him. Featuring not 1,but 3 Femme Fatale dames!,each of the actresses show a determination in making their own pointed-heel mark in being the leading dame of this Neo-Noir,with Annabella Sciorra slowly revealing a real bite as Natalie,whilst Juliette Lewis brilliantly shows Grimaldi's girlfriend/mistress Sheri finding out that she has gotten too close with sinister folk who will now not let Sheri going back to her normal life,and steaming up the screen the moment she arrives,the beautiful Lena Olin mixes a strong,erotic sensual appearance,with a psychotic,demon like laughs that leads Jack to realising how deep in his self created money pit he has sunk.

    Romeo Is Bleeding is directed by Peter Medak and written by Hilary Henkin. It stars Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis and Roy Scheider. Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress, but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov (Olin), he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone... A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics, Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neo-noir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours, it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it, that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top, where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in, a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously. The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view, he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a "hit" and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation, while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image - or a scene at a amusement park - further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen. Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5/10

    Life is a matter of not wanting too much of anything, not trying to be God or play God, not always looking for grass that you think is greener but isn't, being yourself, rolling with the punches, believing in and trusting the man upstairs, playing it fair and square, and, above all, following where love leads and not destroying it when it shows up or you feel it. Break the rules and you pay for it. You lose what's good but what you fail to appreciate because you're too dumb or greedy to know any better. Gary Oldman is nothing short of terrific in this movie, and very effective are the three women with whom he is involved: his wife (Annabella Sciorra), his waitress girl friend (Juliette Lewis), and a very twisted Russian hit woman (Lena Olin). Oldman breaks most all the rules I just mentioned, and he is the loser for it. He finds that hell is on this earth, and he says so. He falls in love with his stash of dirty cash. He sells out his job and buddies. He betrays his wife. He is greedy for more money and sex. He doesn't stick with his love. He ends up in the middle of nowhere (another hell) with a bit of hope and memories, and that's after attempted suicide (the gun was out of ammo). Gary goes for the green and loses the gold, his wife. A good woman, a loyal woman, is worth more to a man than any amount of precious jewels. So goes the proverb, and this is true. His wife is so disillusioned with him that she has lost all feeling for life. She believes in nothing. She despairs and now fears death. He has killed her hopes and dreams. She never comes backs to him. His girl friend loves him and is under the illusion he loves her. She's an honestly frustrated soul, but she'd get over it except that he ends up killing her too, not only directly but by getting involved with the Lena Olin. She's a fantastic character who gets sadistic satisfaction at betraying every man in sight, but she gets her comeuppance too, much to her surprise. It's a simple morality tale. Oldman is a dirty cop and a dirty husband and a weak and misdirected man who loses what he had. He pays for it. Despite all that, he's an enormously sympathetic character, because we all have his weaknesses. We want him to beat the odds and win, and he tries very hard to do it. We're rooting for him and ourselves and everyone else who tries, and we know we're all going to fall down to various degrees. What man might not be tempted by Lena Olin's charms, even knowing what a bitch she is and how dangerous she is? What man might not fall for Juliette Lewis offering a simple and uncomplicated love? But why Gary may have betrayed his wife for her sister or her niece, we do not know. There is no surer way to destroy a marriage than adultery. The movie is told in flashback and with voice over narration, reminding me of how Carlito's Way was done. It was effective, lending a bittersweet, sorrowful, and at times comical tone to the essentially tragic proceedings. The music score was very effective at times in its use of a jazz trumpet. In fact, it was written and played by jazz trumpet player Mark Isham. Jazz scores as in such film noirs as Elevator to the Gallows and Odds Against Tomorrow are often very effective, and this movie shows how it can be done in a neo-noir.

    Every time its May 1 or December 1, I think of this movie. It means something, it must be good to leave that kind of impression on me. When a movie sticks in your mind, even if its just one quote, for so long after you have seen it (and the last time I saw it was 3 or 4 years ago) it means it can't be bad. So thats one thing. Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Michael Wincott, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra, Will Patton and James Cromwell-all serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this so-flawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost, he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character, no? And in the end he does the right thing, but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about that-how we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us. What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean, corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her, then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well, maybe not after all. Its a movie that succeeds in pulling it all together rather well and at the same time making us stay on the edge of our seat to see whats gonna happen next. Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one, Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in, this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding. Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin, who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened, there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody, not even he, knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.

It has an overwritten melodramatic monologue which drags on way too long. Romeo is Bleeding delivers the classic 'noir' first person narration. If it had done a better job of explaining the story as it unfolded rather than the tiny little voice in Oldman's head, I think that would have also been an improvement on the film When all is said and done, Romeo is Bleeding qualifies as a swing and a miss. It is in desperate need of a rewrite, an energy boost, and some brains. I'll have to say skip this one.

    If you're looking for realism and seriousness don't watch it. Always complaining and whining about over-acting don't watch this. Go see Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant instead if you can handle the realism in that movie at least, has a bit of over-acting too though. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin and Roy Scheider are absolutely brilliant and super-cool in this movie. Beautiful entertaining piece of artwork. Extremely violent and very sexy. I've read a few negative reviews about this movie. I suppose those people can't relate to this. Maybe they never crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed and never as a result of this experienced the inescapable downward spiral leading straight to oblivion. Lucky them.

    I had to comment because I simply can not believe all of the lower rating numbers this film has received; it's one of my very favorite films of the 1990s. This film is not perfect, as stated by other people, Roy Schieder is terribly miscast (although I was more distracted by his obvious face-lift). Otherwise, this film rocks. The rest of the cast is simply superb and I don't know how in the world Gary Oldman, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra and Lena Olin were not nominated for the Academy Award in their respective categories. Hilary Henkin has written a tight and compelling script and it's directed with sheer brilliance. Gary Oldmaan is one of the best actors of his generation and nowhere is that comment more obvious than in his performance in this film. As Jack Grimaldi, his New York accent is spot-on. He creates a character which most people will recognize somewhere in his/her life and delivers it with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her performance is funny, touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra is glorious as Jack's earth-mother wife. Everything about her performance rings true. But, it's impossible to even find words to describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful, sexy, tough, cold-hearted, vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years, and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't even nominated! When this film failed to get any nominations at all was the time I stopped watching the Oscars. Rent it. You'll never forget it.

    Franticly looking around for a Neo-Noir to watch for a poll that was being held on the Classic Film board for the best movies of 1993,I was disappointed to find that my original choice of Neo-Noir viewing in John Dahl's Red Rock West was being sold at a too expensive price. Not giving up on tracking down a Noir from 93,I was thrilled,when after spending an hour of searching around everywhere online,I finally found a Neo-Noir that seemed to offer all of the dark delights that I had been searching for. The plot: Frustrated over his job being at a standstill and there being a huge gap between his dreams and the money in his wallet,police officer Jack Grimaldi decides to become an informant for a powerful gangster called Don Falcone,with Grimaldi's leaked details to the mob over current police investigations being exchanged for more cash than Jack has ever seen,which leads to Grimaldi deciding that the only safe place where he can safely keep this vast bundle is in a sewer drain,that is based in the back garden of the house which he lives in with his wife,Natalie. Happy over now having enough cash that allows Jack to buy whatever he and Natalie dream of,along with also being able to afford keeping a mistress/girlfriend on the side for the first time ever,Jack accepts Don's new request of helping to "get rid" of a former friend/fellow gangster of Falcone's called Mona Demarkov,who along with currently being held by police,is also being very vocal in saying that she is now bigger and more powerful than Falcone. Planning to get rid of Don's "problem' right away,Jack finds from the moment that his eyes set on Mona,that he becomes tantalised by the alluring sensual powers that she posses,which leads Grimaldi to excitingly suspect that he has finally met a Femme Fatale,who will turn out to be more deadlier than any of the "Julliets" that Grimaldi has spent his life being round. View on the film: Proving that Neo-Noirs do not just come from "a mans world",the fantastic screenplay by Hilary Henkin gives the movie a deliciously Black Comedy scar deep across both its cheeks,with Henkin showing Jack Grimaldi's (played by a wonderfully scrambled Gary Oldman) happiness over feeling the garden drain with a newly discovered flow of cash,slowly transform into an addiction,where the whole meaning of his existence lays in continuing to make his money pit go "deeper" by any means necessary. Working closely with the precise editing of Walter Murch,cinematography Datiusz Wolski and director Peter Medak shoot this terrific Neo-Noir in stylish low angles,which along with showing how "low life" the characters are,also creates a strong subtle atmosphere for the viewer that they are seeing Grimaldi's life slowly sink into the pit,which he has unintentionally dug out for himself.Along with the stylish low angles,Medak and Murch also give the film a surprisingly surreal edge by revealing the unrolling state of mind that Jack finds himself in,from having nightmares in a fairground ride,to seeing every woman that he has gone with aim a gun at him. Featuring not 1,but 3 Femme Fatale dames!,each of the actresses show a determination in making their own pointed-heel mark in being the leading dame of this Neo-Noir,with Annabella Sciorra slowly revealing a real bite as Natalie,whilst Juliette Lewis brilliantly shows Grimaldi's girlfriend/mistress Sheri finding out that she has gotten too close with sinister folk who will now not let Sheri going back to her normal life,and steaming up the screen the moment she arrives,the beautiful Lena Olin mixes a strong,erotic sensual appearance,with a psychotic,demon like laughs that leads Jack to realising how deep in his self created money pit he has sunk.

    Romeo Is Bleeding is directed by Peter Medak and written by Hilary Henkin. It stars Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis and Roy Scheider. Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress, but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov (Olin), he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone... A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics, Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neo-noir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours, it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it, that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top, where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in, a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously. The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view, he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a "hit" and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation, while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image - or a scene at a amusement park - further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen. Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5/10

    Life is a matter of not wanting too much of anything, not trying to be God or play God, not always looking for grass that you think is greener but isn't, being yourself, rolling with the punches, believing in and trusting the man upstairs, playing it fair and square, and, above all, following where love leads and not destroying it when it shows up or you feel it. Break the rules and you pay for it. You lose what's good but what you fail to appreciate because you're too dumb or greedy to know any better. Gary Oldman is nothing short of terrific in this movie, and very effective are the three women with whom he is involved: his wife (Annabella Sciorra), his waitress girl friend (Juliette Lewis), and a very twisted Russian hit woman (Lena Olin). Oldman breaks most all the rules I just mentioned, and he is the loser for it. He finds that hell is on this earth, and he says so. He falls in love with his stash of dirty cash. He sells out his job and buddies. He betrays his wife. He is greedy for more money and sex. He doesn't stick with his love. He ends up in the middle of nowhere (another hell) with a bit of hope and memories, and that's after attempted suicide (the gun was out of ammo). Gary goes for the green and loses the gold, his wife. A good woman, a loyal woman, is worth more to a man than any amount of precious jewels. So goes the proverb, and this is true. His wife is so disillusioned with him that she has lost all feeling for life. She believes in nothing. She despairs and now fears death. He has killed her hopes and dreams. She never comes backs to him. His girl friend loves him and is under the illusion he loves her. She's an honestly frustrated soul, but she'd get over it except that he ends up killing her too, not only directly but by getting involved with the Lena Olin. She's a fantastic character who gets sadistic satisfaction at betraying every man in sight, but she gets her comeuppance too, much to her surprise. It's a simple morality tale. Oldman is a dirty cop and a dirty husband and a weak and misdirected man who loses what he had. He pays for it. Despite all that, he's an enormously sympathetic character, because we all have his weaknesses. We want him to beat the odds and win, and he tries very hard to do it. We're rooting for him and ourselves and everyone else who tries, and we know we're all going to fall down to various degrees. What man might not be tempted by Lena Olin's charms, even knowing what a bitch she is and how dangerous she is? What man might not fall for Juliette Lewis offering a simple and uncomplicated love? But why Gary may have betrayed his wife for her sister or her niece, we do not know. There is no surer way to destroy a marriage than adultery. The movie is told in flashback and with voice over narration, reminding me of how Carlito's Way was done. It was effective, lending a bittersweet, sorrowful, and at times comical tone to the essentially tragic proceedings. The music score was very effective at times in its use of a jazz trumpet. In fact, it was written and played by jazz trumpet player Mark Isham. Jazz scores as in such film noirs as Elevator to the Gallows and Odds Against Tomorrow are often very effective, and this movie shows how it can be done in a neo-noir.

    Every time its May 1 or December 1, I think of this movie. It means something, it must be good to leave that kind of impression on me. When a movie sticks in your mind, even if its just one quote, for so long after you have seen it (and the last time I saw it was 3 or 4 years ago) it means it can't be bad. So thats one thing. Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Michael Wincott, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra, Will Patton and James Cromwell-all serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this so-flawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost, he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character, no? And in the end he does the right thing, but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about that-how we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us. What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean, corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her, then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well, maybe not after all. Its a movie that succeeds in pulling it all together rather well and at the same time making us stay on the edge of our seat to see whats gonna happen next. Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one, Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in, this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding. Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin, who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened, there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody, not even he, knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.

    Legend says that, after seeing this film, Bon Jovi decided not to allow their ballade "Always" to be included in it, even though it was written for the film. It's their loss. Romeo is Bleeding is one of those films you either love or hate; it's energetic, unapologetic and raw. Not subtle at all. It goes between a perfect film noir and a parody of the genre. But the best thing about it is the fact it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a story of a dirty cop and a mysterious, dangerous woman. Gary Odlman and Lena Olin are perfect in their roles, neatly over the top when situation demands it. They understand what kind of the film they're in, even if we don't get it; but everything fits so well at the end. No, it is not a serious, nostalgic film noir. Nor is a highly sexualized 90s crime drama along the lines of Basic Instinct. It's both, at the same time, and more. Some of the action - or sex - scenes will make you laugh, and at one point you might think what you're watching is pure trash. But somehow, it's part of the charm. Because even with the simple (and, dare to say, predictable) plot, this film manages to be unique and memorable.

    I was looking at blurays/dvds at Carrefour a few days ago (European version of Walmart) and I saw the DVD of Romeo Is Bleeding in the cheap DVD section. Generally these are crap films which nobody buys. It was 5.99 TL (Turkish liras). I looked at the back cover and saw that Gary Oldman, whom I think is one of the most underrated actors ever, starred in the film. I consider him to be very talented. I bought the film thinking it might be good and it was not only good, it was actually amazing. The cinematography was beautiful, Oldman and Olin were very good in their roles, the rest of the cast was also good though I think James Cromwell could have a bigger part. The storyline was good and I was not bored for a second, I was interested in what was going to happen next throughout the movie so the pacing was well adjusted. The film is a film noir set in the 90s with a sort of New York we have not seen before. Some people might claim the psycho woman character was unrealistic but I do not think so, many criminals are not like normal people, and she's a prime example. In short, this is one of the most unknown great films that can be bought for a low price. It is underrated and not known by many people, but it is still a classic crime thriller.

    There are a lot of actors who made their initial claim to fame through their "dangerous" persona, Tim Roth, Nicolas Cage, Mickey Rourke, Jack Nicholson and in more recent years Colin Farrell, to which I say puh-leeze. Ladies and gents I give you Gary Oldman -True Romance, Leon, Immortal Beloved, even Air Force One, he plays a crazy better than almost anyone. In Romeo Is Bleeding Oldman is out-crazied by Lena Olin. Big time. Oldman plays Jack, a corrupt cop who takes money from organized crime by selling out informants, witnesses and such. He tells them where the guy is, they whack him. Jack also juggles a wife, a girlfriend and a roving eye, which leads him to get caught by the FBI trying to get it on with a Russian hitwoman he is supposed to be handing over, (enter Lena) as Mona. Mona gets away, the underworld (headed by Roy Scheider) is p****d, and tells Jack to finish the job personally, or else. Jack was already a little stressed but this tweaks it up a notch, what with his girlfriend and wife both threatening to leave, and when he finds Mona she counter offers with a payment to tell the bad guys that she has been killed, assuming by the time they work out they were duped she will have left the country. The basic lesson here is don't trust anyone, by the time Jack sorts himself out he has Mona and the mob trying to kill him, he loses a couple of toes to the latter at one stage, and over a few meetings works out than Mona is absolutely nuts, and will do anything necessary to get what she wants, and I mean anything. Everything about this film is just a bit off kilter, meaning that at times it can feel quite surreal. The tone is always kept dark and if anything it is perhaps a bit of an update on the traditional noir films of the early years of Hollywood, only with a twist. I did like this film, even though it took a while getting where it was going, I guess sometimes you can over-twist things. I have heard some people worship this film and place it right at the top of their all time lists, and they have every right to, though having seen it a couple times I just don't get it personally. What I put that down to is I think everyone has a phase where they decide what it is that they actually like, as opposed to what they think they should like, believe it or not some never work this out. This in large part explains Gwen Stefani's mainstream success. During the immediate period after you make your decision you upgrade anything a couple points, for me this caused me to elevate movies like "Tremors" and "Deep Cover", and I suppose for some "Romeo is Bleeding" is their example. Final Rating  7 / 10. Watch if only Lena Olin going so far Over The Top that she creates a new level of overacting. (I call it "Lithgow-ing". ) If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com

    I'm not a stupid person, but frankly I don't understand Romeo is Bleeding. I'd like to think that it is the film which is problematic not me. Romeo is not merely bleeding, he is falling apart. What we have here is a classic case, of a film that tries to be more than it is capable of. It feels convoluted, unbelievable, and unfortunately is not very involving. NYPD Sargent Jack Grimaldi has been doing petty jobs for a mob which the department has been going after. He gets a few thousand dollars with every job, and he adds it to a pile hidden in his backyard. His latest job is to take out the Russian assassin, who he just arrested the other day. While in his custody she offers him an even better deal with more money. But first , he has to fake her death, getting him clean with the boss, and then he must get out of the mob gig before he gets caught. Things are getting tougher with each passing moment. The whole thing doesn't come together very well. Romeo is Bleeding would have been better with the less is more approach. Some details like Jack's involvement with three different women, and the stiff necked feds (who only appear twice) prove fairly useless to the story. Their screen time may have been a bit more worth while, if anyone bothered to act well, too bad no one does; no one except Roy Scheider. This guy has never done a bad movie, and his one talky scene is actually a pretty good one, certainly the best in the film. Him aside, there are two kinds of performances in Romeo is Bleeding; there are the lazy ones, and there are the over-done ones. Gary Oldman is a case of the former. This is not the kind of person we end up caring for. The ending, which is supposed to earn our sympathy instead earns our impatience. It has an overwritten melodramatic monologue which drags on way too long. Romeo is Bleeding delivers the classic 'noir' first person narration. If it had done a better job of explaining the story as it unfolded rather than the tiny little voice in Oldman's head, I think that would have also been an improvement on the film When all is said and done, Romeo is Bleeding qualifies as a swing and a miss. It is in desperate need of a rewrite, an energy boost, and some brains. I'll have to say skip this one.

    Romeo Is Bleeding is directed by Peter Medak and written by Hilary Henkin. It stars Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis and Roy Scheider. Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress, but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov (Olin), he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone... A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics, Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neo-noir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours, it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it, that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top, where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in, a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously. The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view, he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a "hit" and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation, while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image - or a scene at a amusement park - further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen. Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5/10

    Life is a matter of not wanting too much of anything, not trying to be God or play God, not always looking for grass that you think is greener but isn't, being yourself, rolling with the punches, believing in and trusting the man upstairs, playing it fair and square, and, above all, following where love leads and not destroying it when it shows up or you feel it. Break the rules and you pay for it. You lose what's good but what you fail to appreciate because you're too dumb or greedy to know any better. Gary Oldman is nothing short of terrific in this movie, and very effective are the three women with whom he is involved: his wife (Annabella Sciorra), his waitress girl friend (Juliette Lewis), and a very twisted Russian hit woman (Lena Olin). Oldman breaks most all the rules I just mentioned, and he is the loser for it. He finds that hell is on this earth, and he says so. He falls in love with his stash of dirty cash. He sells out his job and buddies. He betrays his wife. He is greedy for more money and sex. He doesn't stick with his love. He ends up in the middle of nowhere (another hell) with a bit of hope and memories, and that's after attempted suicide (the gun was out of ammo). Gary goes for the green and loses the gold, his wife. A good woman, a loyal woman, is worth more to a man than any amount of precious jewels. So goes the proverb, and this is true. His wife is so disillusioned with him that she has lost all feeling for life. She believes in nothing. She despairs and now fears death. He has killed her hopes and dreams. She never comes backs to him. His girl friend loves him and is under the illusion he loves her. She's an honestly frustrated soul, but she'd get over it except that he ends up killing her too, not only directly but by getting involved with the Lena Olin. She's a fantastic character who gets sadistic satisfaction at betraying every man in sight, but she gets her comeuppance too, much to her surprise. It's a simple morality tale. Oldman is a dirty cop and a dirty husband and a weak and misdirected man who loses what he had. He pays for it. Despite all that, he's an enormously sympathetic character, because we all have his weaknesses. We want him to beat the odds and win, and he tries very hard to do it. We're rooting for him and ourselves and everyone else who tries, and we know we're all going to fall down to various degrees. What man might not be tempted by Lena Olin's charms, even knowing what a bitch she is and how dangerous she is? What man might not fall for Juliette Lewis offering a simple and uncomplicated love? But why Gary may have betrayed his wife for her sister or her niece, we do not know. There is no surer way to destroy a marriage than adultery. The movie is told in flashback and with voice over narration, reminding me of how Carlito's Way was done. It was effective, lending a bittersweet, sorrowful, and at times comical tone to the essentially tragic proceedings. The music score was very effective at times in its use of a jazz trumpet. In fact, it was written and played by jazz trumpet player Mark Isham. Jazz scores as in such film noirs as Elevator to the Gallows and Odds Against Tomorrow are often very effective, and this movie shows how it can be done in a neo-noir.

    Every time its May 1 or December 1, I think of this movie. It means something, it must be good to leave that kind of impression on me. When a movie sticks in your mind, even if its just one quote, for so long after you have seen it (and the last time I saw it was 3 or 4 years ago) it means it can't be bad. So thats one thing. Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Michael Wincott, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra, Will Patton and James Cromwell-all serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this so-flawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost, he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character, no? And in the end he does the right thing, but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about that-how we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us. What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean, corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her, then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well, maybe not after all. Its a movie that succeeds in pulling it all together rather well and at the same time making us stay on the edge of our seat to see whats gonna happen next. Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one, Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in, this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding. Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin, who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened, there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody, not even he, knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.

    Legend says that, after seeing this film, Bon Jovi decided not to allow their ballade "Always" to be included in it, even though it was written for the film. It's their loss. Romeo is Bleeding is one of those films you either love or hate; it's energetic, unapologetic and raw. Not subtle at all. It goes between a perfect film noir and a parody of the genre. But the best thing about it is the fact it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a story of a dirty cop and a mysterious, dangerous woman. Gary Odlman and Lena Olin are perfect in their roles, neatly over the top when situation demands it. They understand what kind of the film they're in, even if we don't get it; but everything fits so well at the end. No, it is not a serious, nostalgic film noir. Nor is a highly sexualized 90s crime drama along the lines of Basic Instinct. It's both, at the same time, and more. Some of the action - or sex - scenes will make you laugh, and at one point you might think what you're watching is pure trash. But somehow, it's part of the charm. Because even with the simple (and, dare to say, predictable) plot, this film manages to be unique and memorable.

    I was looking at blurays/dvds at Carrefour a few days ago (European version of Walmart) and I saw the DVD of Romeo Is Bleeding in the cheap DVD section. Generally these are crap films which nobody buys. It was 5.99 TL (Turkish liras). I looked at the back cover and saw that Gary Oldman, whom I think is one of the most underrated actors ever, starred in the film. I consider him to be very talented. I bought the film thinking it might be good and it was not only good, it was actually amazing. The cinematography was beautiful, Oldman and Olin were very good in their roles, the rest of the cast was also good though I think James Cromwell could have a bigger part. The storyline was good and I was not bored for a second, I was interested in what was going to happen next throughout the movie so the pacing was well adjusted. The film is a film noir set in the 90s with a sort of New York we have not seen before. Some people might claim the psycho woman character was unrealistic but I do not think so, many criminals are not like normal people, and she's a prime example. In short, this is one of the most unknown great films that can be bought for a low price. It is underrated and not known by many people, but it is still a classic crime thriller.

    There are a lot of actors who made their initial claim to fame through their "dangerous" persona, Tim Roth, Nicolas Cage, Mickey Rourke, Jack Nicholson and in more recent years Colin Farrell, to which I say puh-leeze. Ladies and gents I give you Gary Oldman -True Romance, Leon, Immortal Beloved, even Air Force One, he plays a crazy better than almost anyone. In Romeo Is Bleeding Oldman is out-crazied by Lena Olin. Big time. Oldman plays Jack, a corrupt cop who takes money from organized crime by selling out informants, witnesses and such. He tells them where the guy is, they whack him. Jack also juggles a wife, a girlfriend and a roving eye, which leads him to get caught by the FBI trying to get it on with a Russian hitwoman he is supposed to be handing over, (enter Lena) as Mona. Mona gets away, the underworld (headed by Roy Scheider) is p****d, and tells Jack to finish the job personally, or else. Jack was already a little stressed but this tweaks it up a notch, what with his girlfriend and wife both threatening to leave, and when he finds Mona she counter offers with a payment to tell the bad guys that she has been killed, assuming by the time they work out they were duped she will have left the country. The basic lesson here is don't trust anyone, by the time Jack sorts himself out he has Mona and the mob trying to kill him, he loses a couple of toes to the latter at one stage, and over a few meetings works out than Mona is absolutely nuts, and will do anything necessary to get what she wants, and I mean anything. Everything about this film is just a bit off kilter, meaning that at times it can feel quite surreal. The tone is always kept dark and if anything it is perhaps a bit of an update on the traditional noir films of the early years of Hollywood, only with a twist. I did like this film, even though it took a while getting where it was going, I guess sometimes you can over-twist things. I have heard some people worship this film and place it right at the top of their all time lists, and they have every right to, though having seen it a couple times I just don't get it personally. What I put that down to is I think everyone has a phase where they decide what it is that they actually like, as opposed to what they think they should like, believe it or not some never work this out. This in large part explains Gwen Stefani's mainstream success. During the immediate period after you make your decision you upgrade anything a couple points, for me this caused me to elevate movies like "Tremors" and "Deep Cover", and I suppose for some "Romeo is Bleeding" is their example. Final Rating  7 / 10. Watch if only Lena Olin going so far Over The Top that she creates a new level of overacting. (I call it "Lithgow-ing". ) If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com

    I'm not a stupid person, but frankly I don't understand Romeo is Bleeding. I'd like to think that it is the film which is problematic not me. Romeo is not merely bleeding, he is falling apart. What we have here is a classic case, of a film that tries to be more than it is capable of. It feels convoluted, unbelievable, and unfortunately is not very involving. NYPD Sargent Jack Grimaldi has been doing petty jobs for a mob which the department has been going after. He gets a few thousand dollars with every job, and he adds it to a pile hidden in his backyard. His latest job is to take out the Russian assassin, who he just arrested the other day. While in his custody she offers him an even better deal with more money. But first , he has to fake her death, getting him clean with the boss, and then he must get out of the mob gig before he gets caught. Things are getting tougher with each passing moment. The whole thing doesn't come together very well. Romeo is Bleeding would have been better with the less is more approach. Some details like Jack's involvement with three different women, and the stiff necked feds (who only appear twice) prove fairly useless to the story. Their screen time may have been a bit more worth while, if anyone bothered to act well, too bad no one does; no one except Roy Scheider. This guy has never done a bad movie, and his one talky scene is actually a pretty good one, certainly the best in the film. Him aside, there are two kinds of performances in Romeo is Bleeding; there are the lazy ones, and there are the over-done ones. Gary Oldman is a case of the former. This is not the kind of person we end up caring for. The ending, which is supposed to earn our sympathy instead earns our impatience. It has an overwritten melodramatic monologue which drags on way too long. Romeo is Bleeding delivers the classic 'noir' first person narration. If it had done a better job of explaining the story as it unfolded rather than the tiny little voice in Oldman's head, I think that would have also been an improvement on the film When all is said and done, Romeo is Bleeding qualifies as a swing and a miss. It is in desperate need of a rewrite, an energy boost, and some brains. I'll have to say skip this one.

    If you're looking for realism and seriousness don't watch it. Always complaining and whining about over-acting don't watch this. Go see Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant instead if you can handle the realism in that movie at least, has a bit of over-acting too though. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin and Roy Scheider are absolutely brilliant and super-cool in this movie. Beautiful entertaining piece of artwork. Extremely violent and very sexy. I've read a few negative reviews about this movie. I suppose those people can't relate to this. Maybe they never crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed and never as a result of this experienced the inescapable downward spiral leading straight to oblivion. Lucky them.

    I had to comment because I simply can not believe all of the lower rating numbers this film has received; it's one of my very favorite films of the 1990s. This film is not perfect, as stated by other people, Roy Schieder is terribly miscast (although I was more distracted by his obvious face-lift). Otherwise, this film rocks. The rest of the cast is simply superb and I don't know how in the world Gary Oldman, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra and Lena Olin were not nominated for the Academy Award in their respective categories. Hilary Henkin has written a tight and compelling script and it's directed with sheer brilliance. Gary Oldmaan is one of the best actors of his generation and nowhere is that comment more obvious than in his performance in this film. As Jack Grimaldi, his New York accent is spot-on. He creates a character which most people will recognize somewhere in his/her life and delivers it with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her performance is funny, touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra is glorious as Jack's earth-mother wife. Everything about her performance rings true. But, it's impossible to even find words to describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful, sexy, tough, cold-hearted, vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years, and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't even nominated! When this film failed to get any nominations at all was the time I stopped watching the Oscars. Rent it. You'll never forget it.

    Franticly looking around for a Neo-Noir to watch for a poll that was being held on the Classic Film board for the best movies of 1993,I was disappointed to find that my original choice of Neo-Noir viewing in John Dahl's Red Rock West was being sold at a too expensive price. Not giving up on tracking down a Noir from 93,I was thrilled,when after spending an hour of searching around everywhere online,I finally found a Neo-Noir that seemed to offer all of the dark delights that I had been searching for. The plot: Frustrated over his job being at a standstill and there being a huge gap between his dreams and the money in his wallet,police officer Jack Grimaldi decides to become an informant for a powerful gangster called Don Falcone,with Grimaldi's leaked details to the mob over current police investigations being exchanged for more cash than Jack has ever seen,which leads to Grimaldi deciding that the only safe place where he can safely keep this vast bundle is in a sewer drain,that is based in the back garden of the house which he lives in with his wife,Natalie. Happy over now having enough cash that allows Jack to buy whatever he and Natalie dream of,along with also being able to afford keeping a mistress/girlfriend on the side for the first time ever,Jack accepts Don's new request of helping to "get rid" of a former friend/fellow gangster of Falcone's called Mona Demarkov,who along with currently being held by police,is also being very vocal in saying that she is now bigger and more powerful than Falcone. Planning to get rid of Don's "problem' right away,Jack finds from the moment that his eyes set on Mona,that he becomes tantalised by the alluring sensual powers that she posses,which leads Grimaldi to excitingly suspect that he has finally met a Femme Fatale,who will turn out to be more deadlier than any of the "Julliets" that Grimaldi has spent his life being round. View on the film: Proving that Neo-Noirs do not just come from "a mans world",the fantastic screenplay by Hilary Henkin gives the movie a deliciously Black Comedy scar deep across both its cheeks,with Henkin showing Jack Grimaldi's (played by a wonderfully scrambled Gary Oldman) happiness over feeling the garden drain with a newly discovered flow of cash,slowly transform into an addiction,where the whole meaning of his existence lays in continuing to make his money pit go "deeper" by any means necessary. Working closely with the precise editing of Walter Murch,cinematography Datiusz Wolski and director Peter Medak shoot this terrific Neo-Noir in stylish low angles,which along with showing how "low life" the characters are,also creates a strong subtle atmosphere for the viewer that they are seeing Grimaldi's life slowly sink into the pit,which he has unintentionally dug out for himself.Along with the stylish low angles,Medak and Murch also give the film a surprisingly surreal edge by revealing the unrolling state of mind that Jack finds himself in,from having nightmares in a fairground ride,to seeing every woman that he has gone with aim a gun at him. Featuring not 1,but 3 Femme Fatale dames!,each of the actresses show a determination in making their own pointed-heel mark in being the leading dame of this Neo-Noir,with Annabella Sciorra slowly revealing a real bite as Natalie,whilst Juliette Lewis brilliantly shows Grimaldi's girlfriend/mistress Sheri finding out that she has gotten too close with sinister folk who will now not let Sheri going back to her normal life,and steaming up the screen the moment she arrives,the beautiful Lena Olin mixes a strong,erotic sensual appearance,with a psychotic,demon like laughs that leads Jack to realising how deep in his self created money pit he has sunk.

Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one, Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in, this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding. Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin, who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened, there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody, not even he, knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.

    Legend says that, after seeing this film, Bon Jovi decided not to allow their ballade "Always" to be included in it, even though it was written for the film. It's their loss. Romeo is Bleeding is one of those films you either love or hate; it's energetic, unapologetic and raw. Not subtle at all. It goes between a perfect film noir and a parody of the genre. But the best thing about it is the fact it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a story of a dirty cop and a mysterious, dangerous woman. Gary Odlman and Lena Olin are perfect in their roles, neatly over the top when situation demands it. They understand what kind of the film they're in, even if we don't get it; but everything fits so well at the end. No, it is not a serious, nostalgic film noir. Nor is a highly sexualized 90s crime drama along the lines of Basic Instinct. It's both, at the same time, and more. Some of the action - or sex - scenes will make you laugh, and at one point you might think what you're watching is pure trash. But somehow, it's part of the charm. Because even with the simple (and, dare to say, predictable) plot, this film manages to be unique and memorable.

    I was looking at blurays/dvds at Carrefour a few days ago (European version of Walmart) and I saw the DVD of Romeo Is Bleeding in the cheap DVD section. Generally these are crap films which nobody buys. It was 5.99 TL (Turkish liras). I looked at the back cover and saw that Gary Oldman, whom I think is one of the most underrated actors ever, starred in the film. I consider him to be very talented. I bought the film thinking it might be good and it was not only good, it was actually amazing. The cinematography was beautiful, Oldman and Olin were very good in their roles, the rest of the cast was also good though I think James Cromwell could have a bigger part. The storyline was good and I was not bored for a second, I was interested in what was going to happen next throughout the movie so the pacing was well adjusted. The film is a film noir set in the 90s with a sort of New York we have not seen before. Some people might claim the psycho woman character was unrealistic but I do not think so, many criminals are not like normal people, and she's a prime example. In short, this is one of the most unknown great films that can be bought for a low price. It is underrated and not known by many people, but it is still a classic crime thriller.

    There are a lot of actors who made their initial claim to fame through their "dangerous" persona, Tim Roth, Nicolas Cage, Mickey Rourke, Jack Nicholson and in more recent years Colin Farrell, to which I say puh-leeze. Ladies and gents I give you Gary Oldman -True Romance, Leon, Immortal Beloved, even Air Force One, he plays a crazy better than almost anyone. In Romeo Is Bleeding Oldman is out-crazied by Lena Olin. Big time. Oldman plays Jack, a corrupt cop who takes money from organized crime by selling out informants, witnesses and such. He tells them where the guy is, they whack him. Jack also juggles a wife, a girlfriend and a roving eye, which leads him to get caught by the FBI trying to get it on with a Russian hitwoman he is supposed to be handing over, (enter Lena) as Mona. Mona gets away, the underworld (headed by Roy Scheider) is p****d, and tells Jack to finish the job personally, or else. Jack was already a little stressed but this tweaks it up a notch, what with his girlfriend and wife both threatening to leave, and when he finds Mona she counter offers with a payment to tell the bad guys that she has been killed, assuming by the time they work out they were duped she will have left the country. The basic lesson here is don't trust anyone, by the time Jack sorts himself out he has Mona and the mob trying to kill him, he loses a couple of toes to the latter at one stage, and over a few meetings works out than Mona is absolutely nuts, and will do anything necessary to get what she wants, and I mean anything. Everything about this film is just a bit off kilter, meaning that at times it can feel quite surreal. The tone is always kept dark and if anything it is perhaps a bit of an update on the traditional noir films of the early years of Hollywood, only with a twist. I did like this film, even though it took a while getting where it was going, I guess sometimes you can over-twist things. I have heard some people worship this film and place it right at the top of their all time lists, and they have every right to, though having seen it a couple times I just don't get it personally. What I put that down to is I think everyone has a phase where they decide what it is that they actually like, as opposed to what they think they should like, believe it or not some never work this out. This in large part explains Gwen Stefani's mainstream success. During the immediate period after you make your decision you upgrade anything a couple points, for me this caused me to elevate movies like "Tremors" and "Deep Cover", and I suppose for some "Romeo is Bleeding" is their example. Final Rating  7 / 10. Watch if only Lena Olin going so far Over The Top that she creates a new level of overacting.

    I'm not a stupid person, but frankly I don't understand Romeo is Bleeding. I'd like to think that it is the film which is problematic not me. Romeo is not merely bleeding, he is falling apart. What we have here is a classic case, of a film that tries to be more than it is capable of. It feels convoluted, unbelievable, and unfortunately is not very involving. NYPD Sargent Jack Grimaldi has been doing petty jobs for a mob which the department has been going after. He gets a few thousand dollars with every job, and he adds it to a pile hidden in his backyard. His latest job is to take out the Russian assassin, who he just arrested the other day. While in his custody she offers him an even better deal with more money. But first , he has to fake her death, getting him clean with the boss, and then he must get out of the mob gig before he gets caught. Things are getting tougher with each passing moment. The whole thing doesn't come together very well. Romeo is Bleeding would have been better with the less is more approach. Some details like Jack's involvement with three different women, and the stiff necked feds (who only appear twice) prove fairly useless to the story. Their screen time may have been a bit more worth while, if anyone bothered to act well, too bad no one does; no one except Roy Scheider. This guy has never done a bad movie, and his one talky scene is actually a pretty good one, certainly the best in the film. Him aside, there are two kinds of performances in Romeo is Bleeding; there are the lazy ones, and there are the over-done ones. Gary Oldman is a case of the former. This is not the kind of person we end up caring for. The ending, which is supposed to earn our sympathy instead earns our impatience. It has an overwritten melodramatic monologue which drags on way too long. Romeo is Bleeding delivers the classic 'noir' first person narration. If it had done a better job of explaining the story as it unfolded rather than the tiny little voice in Oldman's head, I think that would have also been an improvement on the film When all is said and done, Romeo is Bleeding qualifies as a swing and a miss. It is in desperate need of a rewrite, an energy boost, and some brains. I'll have to say skip this one.

    If you're looking for realism and seriousness don't watch it. Always complaining and whining about over-acting don't watch this. Go see Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant instead if you can handle the realism in that movie at least, has a bit of over-acting too though. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin and Roy Scheider are absolutely brilliant and super-cool in this movie. Beautiful entertaining piece of artwork. Extremely violent and very sexy. I've read a few negative reviews about this movie. I suppose those people can't relate to this. Maybe they never crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed and never as a result of this experienced the inescapable downward spiral leading straight to oblivion. Lucky them.

    I had to comment because I simply can not believe all of the lower rating numbers this film has received; it's one of my very favorite films of the 1990s. This film is not perfect, as stated by other people, Roy Schieder is terribly miscast (although I was more distracted by his obvious face-lift). Otherwise, this film rocks. The rest of the cast is simply superb and I don't know how in the world Gary Oldman, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra and Lena Olin were not nominated for the Academy Award in their respective categories. Hilary Henkin has written a tight and compelling script and it's directed with sheer brilliance. Gary Oldmaan is one of the best actors of his generation and nowhere is that comment more obvious than in his performance in this film. As Jack Grimaldi, his New York accent is spot-on. He creates a character which most people will recognize somewhere in his/her life and delivers it with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her performance is funny, touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra is glorious as Jack's earth-mother wife. Everything about her performance rings true. But, it's impossible to even find words to describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful, sexy, tough, cold-hearted, vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years, and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't even nominated! When this film failed to get any nominations at all was the time I stopped watching the Oscars. Rent it. You'll never forget it.

    Franticly looking around for a Neo-Noir to watch for a poll that was being held on the Classic Film board for the best movies of 1993,I was disappointed to find that my original choice of Neo-Noir viewing in John Dahl's Red Rock West was being sold at a too expensive price. Not giving up on tracking down a Noir from 93,I was thrilled,when after spending an hour of searching around everywhere online,I finally found a Neo-Noir that seemed to offer all of the dark delights that I had been searching for. The plot: Frustrated over his job being at a standstill and there being a huge gap between his dreams and the money in his wallet,police officer Jack Grimaldi decides to become an informant for a powerful gangster called Don Falcone,with Grimaldi's leaked details to the mob over current police investigations being exchanged for more cash than Jack has ever seen,which leads to Grimaldi deciding that the only safe place where he can safely keep this vast bundle is in a sewer drain,that is based in the back garden of the house which he lives in with his wife,Natalie. Happy over now having enough cash that allows Jack to buy whatever he and Natalie dream of,along with also being able to afford keeping a mistress/girlfriend on the side for the first time ever,Jack accepts Don's new request of helping to "get rid" of a former friend/fellow gangster of Falcone's called Mona Demarkov,who along with currently being held by police,is also being very vocal in saying that she is now bigger and more powerful than Falcone. Planning to get rid of Don's "problem' right away,Jack finds from the moment that his eyes set on Mona,that he becomes tantalised by the alluring sensual powers that she posses,which leads Grimaldi to excitingly suspect that he has finally met a Femme Fatale,who will turn out to be more deadlier than any of the "Julliets" that Grimaldi has spent his life being round. View on the film: Proving that Neo-Noirs do not just come from "a mans world",the fantastic screenplay by Hilary Henkin gives the movie a deliciously Black Comedy scar deep across both its cheeks,with Henkin showing Jack Grimaldi's (played by a wonderfully scrambled Gary Oldman) happiness over feeling the garden drain with a newly discovered flow of cash,slowly transform into an addiction,where the whole meaning of his existence lays in continuing to make his money pit go "deeper" by any means necessary. Working closely with the precise editing of Walter Murch,cinematography Datiusz Wolski and director Peter Medak shoot this terrific Neo-Noir in stylish low angles,which along with showing how "low life" the characters are,also creates a strong subtle atmosphere for the viewer that they are seeing Grimaldi's life slowly sink into the pit,which he has unintentionally dug out for himself.Along with the stylish low angles,Medak and Murch also give the film a surprisingly surreal edge by revealing the unrolling state of mind that Jack finds himself in,from having nightmares in a fairground ride,to seeing every woman that he has gone with aim a gun at him. Featuring not 1,but 3 Femme Fatale dames!,each of the actresses show a determination in making their own pointed-heel mark in being the leading dame of this Neo-Noir,with Annabella Sciorra slowly revealing a real bite as Natalie,whilst Juliette Lewis brilliantly shows Grimaldi's girlfriend/mistress Sheri finding out that she has gotten too close with sinister folk who will now not let Sheri going back to her normal life,and steaming up the screen the moment she arrives,the beautiful Lena Olin mixes a strong,erotic sensual appearance,with a psychotic,demon like laughs that leads Jack to realising how deep in his self created money pit he has sunk.

    Romeo Is Bleeding is directed by Peter Medak and written by Hilary Henkin. It stars Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis and Roy Scheider. Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress, but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov (Olin), he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone... A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics, Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neo-noir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours, it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it, that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top, where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in, a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously. The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view, he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a "hit" and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation, while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image - or a scene at a amusement park - further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen. Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5/10

    Life is a matter of not wanting too much of anything, not trying to be God or play God, not always looking for grass that you think is greener but isn't, being yourself, rolling with the punches, believing in and trusting the man upstairs, playing it fair and square, and, above all, following where love leads and not destroying it when it shows up or you feel it. Break the rules and you pay for it. You lose what's good but what you fail to appreciate because you're too dumb or greedy to know any better. Gary Oldman is nothing short of terrific in this movie, and very effective are the three women with whom he is involved: his wife (Annabella Sciorra), his waitress girl friend (Juliette Lewis), and a very twisted Russian hit woman (Lena Olin). Oldman breaks most all the rules I just mentioned, and he is the loser for it. He finds that hell is on this earth, and he says so. He falls in love with his stash of dirty cash. He sells out his job and buddies. He betrays his wife. He is greedy for more money and sex. He doesn't stick with his love. He ends up in the middle of nowhere (another hell) with a bit of hope and memories, and that's after attempted suicide (the gun was out of ammo). Gary goes for the green and loses the gold, his wife. A good woman, a loyal woman, is worth more to a man than any amount of precious jewels. So goes the proverb, and this is true. His wife is so disillusioned with him that she has lost all feeling for life. She believes in nothing. She despairs and now fears death. He has killed her hopes and dreams. She never comes backs to him. His girl friend loves him and is under the illusion he loves her. She's an honestly frustrated soul, but she'd get over it except that he ends up killing her too, not only directly but by getting involved with the Lena Olin. She's a fantastic character who gets sadistic satisfaction at betraying every man in sight, but she gets her comeuppance too, much to her surprise. It's a simple morality tale. Oldman is a dirty cop and a dirty husband and a weak and misdirected man who loses what he had. He pays for it. Despite all that, he's an enormously sympathetic character, because we all have his weaknesses. We want him to beat the odds and win, and he tries very hard to do it. We're rooting for him and ourselves and everyone else who tries, and we know we're all going to fall down to various degrees. What man might not be tempted by Lena Olin's charms, even knowing what a bitch she is and how dangerous she is? What man might not fall for Juliette Lewis offering a simple and uncomplicated love? But why Gary may have betrayed his wife for her sister or her niece, we do not know. There is no surer way to destroy a marriage than adultery. The movie is told in flashback and with voice over narration, reminding me of how Carlito's Way was done. It was effective, lending a bittersweet, sorrowful, and at times comical tone to the essentially tragic proceedings. The music score was very effective at times in its use of a jazz trumpet. In fact, it was written and played by jazz trumpet player Mark Isham. Jazz scores as in such film noirs as Elevator to the Gallows and Odds Against Tomorrow are often very effective, and this movie shows how it can be done in a neo-noir.

    Every time its May 1 or December 1, I think of this movie. It means something, it must be good to leave that kind of impression on me. When a movie sticks in your mind, even if its just one quote, for so long after you have seen it (and the last time I saw it was 3 or 4 years ago) it means it can't be bad. So thats one thing. Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Michael Wincott, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra, Will Patton and James Cromwell-all serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this so-flawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost, he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character, no? And in the end he does the right thing, but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about that-how we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us. What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean, corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her, then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well, maybe not after all. Its a movie that succeeds in pulling it all together rather well and at the same time making us stay on the edge of our seat to see whats gonna happen next. Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one, Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in, this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding. Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin, who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened, there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody, not even he, knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.

    I'm not a stupid person, but frankly I don't understand Romeo is Bleeding. I'd like to think that it is the film which is problematic not me. Romeo is not merely bleeding, he is falling apart. What we have here is a classic case, of a film that tries to be more than it is capable of. It feels convoluted, unbelievable, and unfortunately is not very involving. NYPD Sargent Jack Grimaldi has been doing petty jobs for a mob which the department has been going after. He gets a few thousand dollars with every job, and he adds it to a pile hidden in his backyard. His latest job is to take out the Russian assassin, who he just arrested the other day. While in his custody she offers him an even better deal with more money. But first , he has to fake her death, getting him clean with the boss, and then he must get out of the mob gig before he gets caught. Things are getting tougher with each passing moment. The whole thing doesn't come together very well. Romeo is Bleeding would have been better with the less is more approach. Some details like Jack's involvement with three different women, and the stiff necked feds (who only appear twice) prove fairly useless to the story. Their screen time may have been a bit more worth while, if anyone bothered to act well, too bad no one does; no one except Roy Scheider. This guy has never done a bad movie, and his one talky scene is actually a pretty good one, certainly the best in the film. Him aside, there are two kinds of performances in Romeo is Bleeding; there are the lazy ones, and there are the over-done ones. Gary Oldman is a case of the former. This is not the kind of person we end up caring for. The ending, which is supposed to earn our sympathy instead earns our impatience. It has an overwritten melodramatic monologue which drags on way too long. Romeo is Bleeding delivers the classic 'noir' first person narration. If it had done a better job of explaining the story as it unfolded rather than the tiny little voice in Oldman's head, I think that would have also been an improvement on the film When all is said and done, Romeo is Bleeding qualifies as a swing and a miss. It is in desperate need of a rewrite, an energy boost, and some brains. I'll have to say skip this one.

    If you're looking for realism and seriousness don't watch it. Always complaining and whining about over-acting don't watch this. Go see Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant instead if you can handle the realism in that movie at least, has a bit of over-acting too though. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin and Roy Scheider are absolutely brilliant and super-cool in this movie. Beautiful entertaining piece of artwork. Extremely violent and very sexy. I've read a few negative reviews about this movie. I suppose those people can't relate to this. Maybe they never crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed and never as a result of this experienced the inescapable downward spiral leading straight to oblivion. Lucky them.

    I had to comment because I simply can not believe all of the lower rating numbers this film has received; it's one of my very favorite films of the 1990s. This film is not perfect, as stated by other people, Roy Schieder is terribly miscast (although I was more distracted by his obvious face-lift). Otherwise, this film rocks. The rest of the cast is simply superb and I don't know how in the world Gary Oldman, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra and Lena Olin were not nominated for the Academy Award in their respective categories. Hilary Henkin has written a tight and compelling script and it's directed with sheer brilliance. Gary Oldmaan is one of the best actors of his generation and nowhere is that comment more obvious than in his performance in this film. As Jack Grimaldi, his New York accent is spot-on. He creates a character which most people will recognize somewhere in his/her life and delivers it with such ease that you live Jack's life through this outstanding actor's performance. Juliette Lewis has never been better. Her performance is funny, touching and ultimately tragic. Annabella Sciorra is glorious as Jack's earth-mother wife. Everything about her performance rings true. But, it's impossible to even find words to describe Lena Olin's Mona Demarkoff. Wow! Beautiful, sexy, tough, cold-hearted, vicious and unrelenting. I'm impossible to ever forget her performance once you've seen it. I haven't seen this film in years, and I'm still upset that she didn't win the Academy Award and wasn't even nominated! When this film failed to get any nominations at all was the time I stopped watching the Oscars. Rent it. You'll never forget it.

    Franticly looking around for a Neo-Noir to watch for a poll that was being held on the Classic Film board for the best movies of 1993,I was disappointed to find that my original choice of Neo-Noir viewing in John Dahl's Red Rock West was being sold at a too expensive price. Not giving up on tracking down a Noir from 93,I was thrilled,when after spending an hour of searching around everywhere online,I finally found a Neo-Noir that seemed to offer all of the dark delights that I had been searching for. The plot: Frustrated over his job being at a standstill and there being a huge gap between his dreams and the money in his wallet,police officer Jack Grimaldi decides to become an informant for a powerful gangster called Don Falcone,with Grimaldi's leaked details to the mob over current police investigations being exchanged for more cash than Jack has ever seen,which leads to Grimaldi deciding that the only safe place where he can safely keep this vast bundle is in a sewer drain,that is based in the back garden of the house which he lives in with his wife,Natalie. Happy over now having enough cash that allows Jack to buy whatever he and Natalie dream of,along with also being able to afford keeping a mistress/girlfriend on the side for the first time ever,Jack accepts Don's new request of helping to "get rid" of a former friend/fellow gangster of Falcone's called Mona Demarkov,who along with currently being held by police,is also being very vocal in saying that she is now bigger and more powerful than Falcone. Planning to get rid of Don's "problem' right away,Jack finds from the moment that his eyes set on Mona,that he becomes tantalised by the alluring sensual powers that she posses,which leads Grimaldi to excitingly suspect that he has finally met a Femme Fatale,who will turn out to be more deadlier than any of the "Julliets" that Grimaldi has spent his life being round. View on the film: Proving that Neo-Noirs do not just come from "a mans world",the fantastic screenplay by Hilary Henkin gives the movie a deliciously Black Comedy scar deep across both its cheeks,with Henkin showing Jack Grimaldi's (played by a wonderfully scrambled Gary Oldman) happiness over feeling the garden drain with a newly discovered flow of cash,slowly transform into an addiction,where the whole meaning of his existence lays in continuing to make his money pit go "deeper" by any means necessary. Working closely with the precise editing of Walter Murch,cinematography Datiusz Wolski and director Peter Medak shoot this terrific Neo-Noir in stylish low angles,which along with showing how "low life" the characters are,also creates a strong subtle atmosphere for the viewer that they are seeing Grimaldi's life slowly sink into the pit,which he has unintentionally dug out for himself.Along with the stylish low angles,Medak and Murch also give the film a surprisingly surreal edge by revealing the unrolling state of mind that Jack finds himself in,from having nightmares in a fairground ride,to seeing every woman that he has gone with aim a gun at him. Featuring not 1,but 3 Femme Fatale dames!,each of the actresses show a determination in making their own pointed-heel mark in being the leading dame of this Neo-Noir,with Annabella Sciorra slowly revealing a real bite as Natalie,whilst Juliette Lewis brilliantly shows Grimaldi's girlfriend/mistress Sheri finding out that she has gotten too close with sinister folk who will now not let Sheri going back to her normal life,and steaming up the screen the moment she arrives,the beautiful Lena Olin mixes a strong,erotic sensual appearance,with a psychotic,demon like laughs that leads Jack to realising how deep in his self created money pit he has sunk.

    Romeo Is Bleeding is directed by Peter Medak and written by Hilary Henkin. It stars Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis and Roy Scheider. Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress, but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov (Olin), he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone... A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics, Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neo-noir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours, it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it, that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top, where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in, a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously. The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view, he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a "hit" and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation, while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image - or a scene at a amusement park - further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen. Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5/10

    Life is a matter of not wanting too much of anything, not trying to be God or play God, not always looking for grass that you think is greener but isn't, being yourself, rolling with the punches, believing in and trusting the man upstairs, playing it fair and square, and, above all, following where love leads and not destroying it when it shows up or you feel it. Break the rules and you pay for it. You lose what's good but what you fail to appreciate because you're too dumb or greedy to know any better. Gary Oldman is nothing short of terrific in this movie, and very effective are the three women with whom he is involved: his wife (Annabella Sciorra), his waitress girl friend (Juliette Lewis), and a very twisted Russian hit woman (Lena Olin). Oldman breaks most all the rules I just mentioned, and he is the loser for it. He finds that hell is on this earth, and he says so. He falls in love with his stash of dirty cash. He sells out his job and buddies. He betrays his wife. He is greedy for more money and sex. He doesn't stick with his love. He ends up in the middle of nowhere (another hell) with a bit of hope and memories, and that's after attempted suicide (the gun was out of ammo). Gary goes for the green and loses the gold, his wife. A good woman, a loyal woman, is worth more to a man than any amount of precious jewels. So goes the proverb, and this is true. His wife is so disillusioned with him that she has lost all feeling for life. She believes in nothing. She despairs and now fears death. He has killed her hopes and dreams. She never comes backs to him. His girl friend loves him and is under the illusion he loves her. She's an honestly frustrated soul, but she'd get over it except that he ends up killing her too, not only directly but by getting involved with the Lena Olin. She's a fantastic character who gets sadistic satisfaction at betraying every man in sight, but she gets her comeuppance too, much to her surprise. It's a simple morality tale. Oldman is a dirty cop and a dirty husband and a weak and misdirected man who loses what he had. He pays for it. Despite all that, he's an enormously sympathetic character, because we all have his weaknesses. We want him to beat the odds and win, and he tries very hard to do it. We're rooting for him and ourselves and everyone else who tries, and we know we're all going to fall down to various degrees. What man might not be tempted by Lena Olin's charms, even knowing what a bitch she is and how dangerous she is? What man might not fall for Juliette Lewis offering a simple and uncomplicated love? But why Gary may have betrayed his wife for her sister or her niece, we do not know. There is no surer way to destroy a marriage than adultery. The movie is told in flashback and with voice over narration, reminding me of how Carlito's Way was done. It was effective, lending a bittersweet, sorrowful, and at times comical tone to the essentially tragic proceedings. The music score was very effective at times in its use of a jazz trumpet. In fact, it was written and played by jazz trumpet player Mark Isham. Jazz scores as in such film noirs as Elevator to the Gallows and Odds Against Tomorrow are often very effective, and this movie shows how it can be done in a neo-noir.

    Every time its May 1 or December 1, I think of this movie. It means something, it must be good to leave that kind of impression on me. When a movie sticks in your mind, even if its just one quote, for so long after you have seen it (and the last time I saw it was 3 or 4 years ago) it means it can't be bad. So thats one thing. Another thing is that it has absolutely top notch cast. Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Michael Wincott, Juliette Lewis, Annabella Sciorra, Will Patton and James Cromwell-all serious and talented actors. And the story is very interesting too. I mean you have this so-flawed main character who is at the same time very human and even sympathetic in a way that he's lost, he can't really help all the mess he's got himself in. It is a very human character, no? And in the end he does the right thing, but is it too late? Seems so. This movie is just about that-how we sometimes don't wake up and see the light until we have lost everything that was dear to us. What is the flaw with the movie? Maybe its that it didn't perhaps get everything it could from such an interesting storyline. I mean, corrupt cop who's in the mafia's pocket and cheats on his wife yet loves her, then gets caught in the dangerous game with a deadly Russian criminal who is a man eater at the same time...well, maybe not after all. Its a movie that succeeds in pulling it all together rather well and at the same time making us stay on the edge of our seat to see whats gonna happen next. Not many American modern movies have done that. I can mention one that came out the same year as this one, Carlito's Way. But that is a different story and genre really. That was a gangster film noir with a love story thrown in, this is both a film noir and a love story. Thats why the title is ROMEO is Bleeding. Gary Oldman makes one of his strongest performances and the same can perhaps be said for Olin, who is very convincing and menacing in her part as the deadly seductress whose only aim is to devour everything in her path. The ending leaves us in doubt to what really happened, there is no typical Hollywood ending and thats good. It again mirrors how things really go in life as Jack is left on his own waiting anxiously for his wife but nobody, not even he, knows if he will ever see her again. And thats art imitating life.

    Legend says that, after seeing this film, Bon Jovi decided not to allow their ballade "Always" to be included in it, even though it was written for the film. It's their loss. Romeo is Bleeding is one of those films you either love or hate; it's energetic, unapologetic and raw. Not subtle at all. It goes between a perfect film noir and a parody of the genre. But the best thing about it is the fact it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a story of a dirty cop and a mysterious, dangerous woman. Gary Odlman and Lena Olin are perfect in their roles, neatly over the top when situation demands it. They understand what kind of the film they're in, even if we don't get it; but everything fits so well at the end. No, it is not a serious, nostalgic film noir. Nor is a highly sexualized 90s crime drama along the lines of Basic Instinct. It's both, at the same time, and more. Some of the action - or sex - scenes will make you laugh, and at one point you might think what you're watching is pure trash. But somehow, it's part of the charm. Because even with the simple (and, dare to say, predictable) plot, this film manages to be unique and memorable.

    I was looking at blurays/dvds at Carrefour a few days ago (European version of Walmart) and I saw the DVD of Romeo Is Bleeding in the cheap DVD section. Generally these are crap films which nobody buys. It was 5.99 TL (Turkish liras). I looked at the back cover and saw that Gary Oldman, whom I think is one of the most underrated actors ever, starred in the film. I consider him to be very talented. I bought the film thinking it might be good and it was not only good, it was actually amazing. The cinematography was beautiful, Oldman and Olin were very good in their roles, the rest of the cast was also good though I think James Cromwell could have a bigger part. The storyline was good and I was not bored for a second, I was interested in what was going to happen next throughout the movie so the pacing was well adjusted. The film is a film noir set in the 90s with a sort of New York we have not seen before. Some people might claim the psycho woman character was unrealistic but I do not think so, many criminals are not like normal people, and she's a prime example. In short, this is one of the most unknown great films that can be bought for a low price. It is underrated and not known by many people, but it is still a classic crime thriller.

    There are a lot of actors who made their initial claim to fame through their "dangerous" persona, Tim Roth, Nicolas Cage, Mickey Rourke, Jack Nicholson and in more recent years Colin Farrell, to which I say puh-leeze. Ladies and gents I give you Gary Oldman -True Romance, Leon, Immortal Beloved, even Air Force One, he plays a crazy better than almost anyone. In Romeo Is Bleeding Oldman is out-crazied by Lena Olin. Big time. Oldman plays Jack, a corrupt cop who takes money from organized crime by selling out informants, witnesses and such. He tells them where the guy is, they whack him. Jack also juggles a wife, a girlfriend and a roving eye, which leads him to get caught by the FBI trying to get it on with a Russian hitwoman he is supposed to be handing over, (enter Lena) as Mona. Mona gets away, the underworld (headed by Roy Scheider) is p****d, and tells Jack to finish the job personally, or else. Jack was already a little stressed but this tweaks it up a notch, what with his girlfriend and wife both threatening to leave, and when he finds Mona she counter offers with a payment to tell the bad guys that she has been killed, assuming by the time they work out they were duped she will have left the country. The basic lesson here is don't trust anyone, by the time Jack sorts himself out he has Mona and the mob trying to kill him, he loses a couple of toes to the latter at one stage, and over a few meetings works out than Mona is absolutely nuts, and will do anything necessary to get what she wants, and I mean anything. Everything about this film is just a bit off kilter, meaning that at times it can feel quite surreal. The tone is always kept dark and if anything it is perhaps a bit of an update on the traditional noir films of the early years of Hollywood, only with a twist. I did like this film, even though it took a while getting where it was going, I guess sometimes you can over-twist things. I have heard some people worship this film and place it right at the top of their all time lists, and they have every right to, though having seen it a couple times I just don't get it personally. What I put that down to is I think everyone has a phase where they decide what it is that they actually like, as opposed to what they think they should like, believe it or not some never work this out. This in large part explains Gwen Stefani's mainstream success. During the immediate period after you make your decision you upgrade anything a couple points, for me this caused me to elevate movies like "Tremors" and "Deep Cover", and I suppose for some "Romeo is Bleeding" is their example. Final Rating  7 / 10. Watch if only Lena Olin going so far Over The Top that she creates a new level of overacting. (I call it "Lithgow-ing". ) If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com
