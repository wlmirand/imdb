    I watch it over and over again. All actors are well chosen. The director didn't waste the story - on the contrary, he turned it out in a beautiful film, which I watch with pleasure. I was afraid first that Dumas' novel won't come up well on film. But the film turned out to be better than the book. So powerful and impressive performance. Excellent work, the staff didn't miss any detail and didn't ruin the classic story. I am glad Randall Wallace did his job so well and professionally. More historic films would fill our entertainment with more pleasure and I think, would change the values of the young people of our days. Excellent!

    Directed, Produced, & Written by Randall Wallace, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is one of the finest entertainers from the late 90's. A Well-Acted & Well-Directed Film, that is a good mix of drama & humor. 'The Man in the Iron Mask' Synopsis: The cruel King Louis XIV of France has a secret twin brother who he keeps imprisoned. Can the twin be substituted for the real king? What makes 'The Man in the Iron Mask' work, is its engaging story, that isn't dry of dark, but, in fact, dramatic, humorous & even emotional, at places. Wallace's Screenplay deserves brownie points for bringing in almost every element in this adventure film. Wallace's is skilled. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are amazing. Costume Design is perfect. Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent. He plays both the parts with diversity & immense confidence. Jeremy Irons is highly effective. John Malkovich is, as always, flawless. G&eacute;rard Depardieu raises some great laughs. Gabriel Byrne is simply mesmerizing. He is the real scene-stealer here. Hugh Laurie leaves a mark. On the whole, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is an adventure worth watching.

    I'm rating this film as mediocre because to me the Salkind productions are the gold standard for musketeer films. This one simply doesn't have the craft, care and ultimate quality that went into the progenitors of the 1970s, both directed by Richard Lester who brought us a gritty and whimsical late renaissance France. This 1998 film is all spit and polish with some emotional flourishes. The production values are all bright and shiny. Even the peasants are well lit, and look like they were made up to look like starving peasants, again, verse the 1970's versions which let the set, actors and story speak for itself. The story is a very interesting one, but the execution looks borderline B-grade film making with a high budget. The shots are uninspired, the sets are sanitized, the costumes are colorful, the fencing, what little there is, is not gripping in the least. There's some humor, but it's so telegraphed and couched in teenage humor sensibilities that it's hardly worth commenting on. I think I laughed once. It is a finely polished production for what it is, but beyond that I would recommend you look for musketeer entertainment elsewhere. See it once, but don't say I didn't warn you.

    A chance to bring the musketeers to the big screen again! Romance, revolution, retribution, ... really?. The film starts sensibly, and dolls out information at a reasonable pace for the first 70% of the movie. The musketeers' performances are acceptable, although every one of Athos's lines is delivered in a tone that I can only describe as Malkovichian. However, Leo is pretty painful to watch as both Louis and Philippe. I'm not sure what's worse, listening to him blunder through Louis's smarmy monologues or watching him feign wistful expressions as Philippe (he knows wistful and listless are distinct emotional states, right?). There's some swashbuckling action, some political intrigue, some subtle (and by subtle I simply mean "not explicit") character development. The final 30% of the movie, though, takes a turn for the melodramatic and completely kills any interest I had established at that point. The film isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good either.

    Had been on a Di Caprio binge and thought I'd reach out into unchartered back catalogue fodder blasts. Pompous costumes, wooden, stilted dialogue and no sight of the man in the iron mask! For a lot of talk of nipples I in fact found this to be a load of balls. Still... it was only the first 10 minutes. Now if Iron Man had turned up then this might be 10 minutes that I won't spend one in every further 10 for the rest of my days wondering how I could ever get them back.

    That's very sad. It's too underrated, and this movie is really good. The story is good and emotional (not in girly way), the cast is nice and talented. I don't know what people were expecting more. Leonardo DiCaprio is such an annoying little brat here, but acts so well. Jeremy Irons delivers such a powerful and empathetic character in a way that you can actually feel and see in his eyes the pain he's going through the whole movie. At the end you find out why Aramis was acting that way towards his old friends that you wonder how he resisted and not broke down in any moment. We have some comic relief coming from G&eacute;rard Depardieu's Porthos. He manages to calm down the tense atmosphere and give some sense of relieve to others as well. He is a very talented actor, and he really made me laugh in this. It deserved some more nominations for sure. At least DiCaprio and Irons whom gave some really wonderful performances. It's very sad. I hope in the future the users will rate this higher. It doesn't deserve 6,3. At least a 7. AT LEAST! Worth watching, very good movie, way underrated. It stands in the 3rd place in my own personal favorite movies of all time (The first is "Les Miserables" 1998, the second is "The painted veil" 2004). 9/10

    I've always been intrigued by the legend of The Man In The Iron Mask. I am also a big fan of the writing of Alexander Dumas. So quite obviously I had high expectations from this movie. I was not disappointed. The story grips you right from the beiging to the very end. The cinematography,costumes and scenery are nothing short of breath taking. The script was written to perfection staying as true to the original Dumas story as it possibly could.The performance from Jermey Irons was good. Unfortunaly the same cannot be said about the rest of the cast. Leonardo Di Caprio was patehic. He constantly speaks with a distinct American accent despite the fact that he is portraying a French King. The same goes for John Malkovich(which surprising considering how talented he is.) On a whole despite some dismal performances, The Man In The Iron Mask is an engrossing tale that should be viewed at least once in your life time.

    I love this movie , Leonardo Dicaprio's performances were stellar! This was a beautiful rendition , of the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas. Though I have seen it many times, it is still one of my favorites. The cast was incredible, and the acting was superb! Especially from the four acclaimed and seasoned actors, who portrayed the aging Musketeers. The only part about this movie, was the mistreatment of the good twin Philipe. Forced to hide his face, and having to live in solitude in a dark dank cell. I really felt sorry for him, because he didn't deserve that punishment! The King (also Dicaprio), was a vindictive spoiled brat especially when he didn't get his way! I didn't care for him to much, but behind the betrayal and deception. There was one character that added levity and that was Portos, I found him to be quite comical! This was one of the best versions of this classic , I have ever seen. I would give it an A++! This is my daughter's take on the movie.I too loved this movie it is just as good as,the one that;Richard Chamberlain was in.

    Oscar-nominated Randall Wallace made his directorial debut with this adaptation of the 1848 classic by Alexandre Dumas, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role in The Man in the Iron Mask.The movie centers on the aging Musketeers Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan and the reign of King Louis XIV of France. It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film. Years have passed since the Three Musketeers, Aramis,Athos, and Porthos fought together with their friend D'Artagnan. The arrogant, tyrannical King Louis XIV desires the beautiful Christine, so he orders her suitor Raoul, the son of Athos, off to face death at the front. He also sends Aramis to kill the leader of a Jesuit rebellion. Louis is unaware that his loyal protector and informant, D'Artagnan, is the secret lover of his mother, Queen Anne. Louis' younger twin brother, Philippe is the man in the iron mask,imprisoned for the past six years. Arthos and Porthos plan to free Philippe, abduct Louis and replace him by putting Philippe on the throne.The four Musketeers and Philippe then charge at Louis's front line. The soldiers are so amazed by their "magnificent valor" that they close their eyes before firing their muskets. The smoke clears to reveal the five men still standing; all the shots, barring a few flesh wounds, missed.An enraged Louis lunges toward Philippe and tries to stab him. However, D'Artagnan jumps between them and is fatally wounded. Philippe knocks Louis down and begins to strangle him, but D'Artagnan, with his dying breaths, reminds Philippe that Louis is his brother. Philippe embraces his father for the first and last time as he dies, commenting that D'Artagnan was the one wearing the mask all along. D'Artagnan's right-hand man, Lieutenant Andre, furious at Louis for killing D'Artagnan, orders his men to leave and swears them to secrecy. By the time another battalion breaks in via another door, the three Musketeers and Lieutenant Andre have made Louis and Philippe swap clothes and locked Louis in the iron mask. Philippe introduces Athos, Porthos and Aramis as his royal council and truest friends. Posing as the King, Philippe orders the guards to take Louis and lock him away. Philippe, Athos, Porthos, Aramis and Queen Anne attend D'Artagnan's funeral, in which the three Musketeers are finally redeemed. After the funeral, Philippe asks Athos to love him like a son and Athos accepts and kisses Philippe's chest. With Louis whom Philippe, for the sake of their blood relation, granted a royal pardon now living in a house in the country, France is at peace under Philippe's rule. The only thing that the movie features is Leonardo DiCaprio in dual roles.Nothing more.I also think that he was some sort of miscast since though a talented actor, DiCaprio is no Errol Flynn. With his choirboy face and chess-club physique, he is scarcely fit to play swashbuckling hero or villain.Overall,it was a poor remake of a frequently told Dumas classic.

    I simply love movies that can entertain and yet, throw some nuggets of wisdom to the viewers. Man in the Iron Mask has couple of dialogues that are like sayings from a wise sage. Rather than reveal anything here, I suggest that you see the flick and hear these for yourself. Here's a good story, music, costumes, art direction, sword fights and also cracking performances from the four musketeers Gabriel Byrne as D'Artagnan, Gerard Depardieu as Porthos, John Malkovich as Athos, Jeremy Irons as Aramis and also Leonardo DiCaprio as King Louise/Phillipe. I truly felt that Leo's acting was outstanding. Even John Malkovich & Gabriel Byrne were class. Some of the lead actors like Judith Godreche as Christine(King Louise's fancy) was average, which was a little disappointing. Besides that, everything in this flick clicks. Verdict: Here's a castle-age movie that you'll never be bored of. All for one, one for all :)

I truly felt that Leo's acting was outstanding. Even John Malkovich & Gabriel Byrne were class. Some of the lead actors like Judith Godreche as Christine(King Louise's fancy) was average, which was a little disappointing. Besides that, everything in this flick clicks. Verdict: Here's a castle-age movie that you'll never be bored of. All for one, one for all :)

    I watch it over and over again. All actors are well chosen. The director didn't waste the story - on the contrary, he turned it out in a beautiful film, which I watch with pleasure. I was afraid first that Dumas' novel won't come up well on film. But the film turned out to be better than the book. So powerful and impressive performance. Excellent work, the staff didn't miss any detail and didn't ruin the classic story. I am glad Randall Wallace did his job so well and professionally. More historic films would fill our entertainment with more pleasure and I think, would change the values of the young people of our days. Excellent!

    Directed, Produced, & Written by Randall Wallace, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is one of the finest entertainers from the late 90's. A Well-Acted & Well-Directed Film, that is a good mix of drama & humor. 'The Man in the Iron Mask' Synopsis: The cruel King Louis XIV of France has a secret twin brother who he keeps imprisoned. Can the twin be substituted for the real king? What makes 'The Man in the Iron Mask' work, is its engaging story, that isn't dry of dark, but, in fact, dramatic, humorous & even emotional, at places. Wallace's Screenplay deserves brownie points for bringing in almost every element in this adventure film. Wallace's is skilled. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are amazing. Costume Design is perfect. Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent. He plays both the parts with diversity & immense confidence. Jeremy Irons is highly effective. John Malkovich is, as always, flawless. G&eacute;rard Depardieu raises some great laughs. Gabriel Byrne is simply mesmerizing. He is the real scene-stealer here. Hugh Laurie leaves a mark. On the whole, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is an adventure worth watching.

    I'm rating this film as mediocre because to me the Salkind productions are the gold standard for musketeer films. This one simply doesn't have the craft, care and ultimate quality that went into the progenitors of the 1970s, both directed by Richard Lester who brought us a gritty and whimsical late renaissance France. This 1998 film is all spit and polish with some emotional flourishes. The production values are all bright and shiny. Even the peasants are well lit, and look like they were made up to look like starving peasants, again, verse the 1970's versions which let the set, actors and story speak for itself. The story is a very interesting one, but the execution looks borderline B-grade film making with a high budget. The shots are uninspired, the sets are sanitized, the costumes are colorful, the fencing, what little there is, is not gripping in the least. There's some humor, but it's so telegraphed and couched in teenage humor sensibilities that it's hardly worth commenting on. I think I laughed once. It is a finely polished production for what it is, but beyond that I would recommend you look for musketeer entertainment elsewhere. See it once, but don't say I didn't warn you.

    A chance to bring the musketeers to the big screen again! Romance, revolution, retribution, ... really?. The film starts sensibly, and dolls out information at a reasonable pace for the first 70% of the movie. The musketeers' performances are acceptable, although every one of Athos's lines is delivered in a tone that I can only describe as Malkovichian. However, Leo is pretty painful to watch as both Louis and Philippe. I'm not sure what's worse, listening to him blunder through Louis's smarmy monologues or watching him feign wistful expressions as Philippe (he knows wistful and listless are distinct emotional states, right?). There's some swashbuckling action, some political intrigue, some subtle (and by subtle I simply mean "not explicit") character development. The final 30% of the movie, though, takes a turn for the melodramatic and completely kills any interest I had established at that point. The film isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good either.

    Had been on a Di Caprio binge and thought I'd reach out into unchartered back catalogue fodder blasts. Pompous costumes, wooden, stilted dialogue and no sight of the man in the iron mask! For a lot of talk of nipples I in fact found this to be a load of balls. Still... it was only the first 10 minutes. Now if Iron Man had turned up then this might be 10 minutes that I won't spend one in every further 10 for the rest of my days wondering how I could ever get them back.

    That's very sad. It's too underrated, and this movie is really good. The story is good and emotional (not in girly way), the cast is nice and talented. I don't know what people were expecting more. Leonardo DiCaprio is such an annoying little brat here, but acts so well. Jeremy Irons delivers such a powerful and empathetic character in a way that you can actually feel and see in his eyes the pain he's going through the whole movie. At the end you find out why Aramis was acting that way towards his old friends that you wonder how he resisted and not broke down in any moment. We have some comic relief coming from G&eacute;rard Depardieu's Porthos. He manages to calm down the tense atmosphere and give some sense of relieve to others as well. He is a very talented actor, and he really made me laugh in this. It deserved some more nominations for sure. At least DiCaprio and Irons whom gave some really wonderful performances. It's very sad. I hope in the future the users will rate this higher. It doesn't deserve 6,3. At least a 7. AT LEAST! Worth watching, very good movie, way underrated. It stands in the 3rd place in my own personal favorite movies of all time (The first is "Les Miserables" 1998, the second is "The painted veil" 2004). 9/10

    I've always been intrigued by the legend of The Man In The Iron Mask. I am also a big fan of the writing of Alexander Dumas. So quite obviously I had high expectations from this movie. I was not disappointed. The story grips you right from the beiging to the very end. The cinematography,costumes and scenery are nothing short of breath taking. The script was written to perfection staying as true to the original Dumas story as it possibly could.The performance from Jermey Irons was good. Unfortunaly the same cannot be said about the rest of the cast. Leonardo Di Caprio was patehic. He constantly speaks with a distinct American accent despite the fact that he is portraying a French King. The same goes for John Malkovich(which surprising considering how talented he is.) On a whole despite some dismal performances, The Man In The Iron Mask is an engrossing tale that should be viewed at least once in your life time.

    I love this movie , Leonardo Dicaprio's performances were stellar! This was a beautiful rendition , of the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas. Though I have seen it many times, it is still one of my favorites. The cast was incredible, and the acting was superb! Especially from the four acclaimed and seasoned actors, who portrayed the aging Musketeers. The only part about this movie, was the mistreatment of the good twin Philipe. Forced to hide his face, and having to live in solitude in a dark dank cell. I really felt sorry for him, because he didn't deserve that punishment! The King (also Dicaprio), was a vindictive spoiled brat especially when he didn't get his way! I didn't care for him to much, but behind the betrayal and deception. There was one character that added levity and that was Portos, I found him to be quite comical! This was one of the best versions of this classic , I have ever seen. I would give it an A++! This is my daughter's take on the movie.I too loved this movie it is just as good as,the one that;Richard Chamberlain was in.

    Oscar-nominated Randall Wallace made his directorial debut with this adaptation of the 1848 classic by Alexandre Dumas, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role in The Man in the Iron Mask.The movie centers on the aging Musketeers Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan and the reign of King Louis XIV of France. It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film. Years have passed since the Three Musketeers, Aramis,Athos, and Porthos fought together with their friend D'Artagnan. The arrogant, tyrannical King Louis XIV desires the beautiful Christine, so he orders her suitor Raoul, the son of Athos, off to face death at the front. He also sends Aramis to kill the leader of a Jesuit rebellion. Louis is unaware that his loyal protector and informant, D'Artagnan, is the secret lover of his mother, Queen Anne. Louis' younger twin brother, Philippe is the man in the iron mask,imprisoned for the past six years. Arthos and Porthos plan to free Philippe, abduct Louis and replace him by putting Philippe on the throne.The four Musketeers and Philippe then charge at Louis's front line. The soldiers are so amazed by their "magnificent valor" that they close their eyes before firing their muskets. The smoke clears to reveal the five men still standing; all the shots, barring a few flesh wounds, missed.An enraged Louis lunges toward Philippe and tries to stab him. However, D'Artagnan jumps between them and is fatally wounded. Philippe knocks Louis down and begins to strangle him, but D'Artagnan, with his dying breaths, reminds Philippe that Louis is his brother. Philippe embraces his father for the first and last time as he dies, commenting that D'Artagnan was the one wearing the mask all along. D'Artagnan's right-hand man, Lieutenant Andre, furious at Louis for killing D'Artagnan, orders his men to leave and swears them to secrecy. By the time another battalion breaks in via another door, the three Musketeers and Lieutenant Andre have made Louis and Philippe swap clothes and locked Louis in the iron mask. Philippe introduces Athos, Porthos and Aramis as his royal council and truest friends. Posing as the King, Philippe orders the guards to take Louis and lock him away. Philippe, Athos, Porthos, Aramis and Queen Anne attend D'Artagnan's funeral, in which the three Musketeers are finally redeemed. After the funeral, Philippe asks Athos to love him like a son and Athos accepts and kisses Philippe's chest. With Louis whom Philippe, for the sake of their blood relation, granted a royal pardon now living in a house in the country, France is at peace under Philippe's rule. The only thing that the movie features is Leonardo DiCaprio in dual roles.Nothing more.I also think that he was some sort of miscast since though a talented actor, DiCaprio is no Errol Flynn. With his choirboy face and chess-club physique, he is scarcely fit to play swashbuckling hero or villain.Overall,it was a poor remake of a frequently told Dumas classic.

Rather than reveal anything here, I suggest that you see the flick and hear these for yourself.

    Directed, Produced, & Written by Randall Wallace, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is one of the finest entertainers from the late 90's. A Well-Acted & Well-Directed Film, that is a good mix of drama & humor. 'The Man in the Iron Mask' Synopsis: The cruel King Louis XIV of France has a secret twin brother who he keeps imprisoned. Can the twin be substituted for the real king? What makes 'The Man in the Iron Mask' work, is its engaging story, that isn't dry of dark, but, in fact, dramatic, humorous & even emotional, at places. Wallace's Screenplay deserves brownie points for bringing in almost every element in this adventure film. Wallace's is skilled. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are amazing. Costume Design is perfect. Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent. He plays both the parts with diversity & immense confidence. Jeremy Irons is highly effective. John Malkovich is, as always, flawless. G&eacute;rard Depardieu raises some great laughs. Gabriel Byrne is simply mesmerizing. He is the real scene-stealer here. Hugh Laurie leaves a mark. On the whole, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is an adventure worth watching.

    I'm rating this film as mediocre because to me the Salkind productions are the gold standard for musketeer films. This one simply doesn't have the craft, care and ultimate quality that went into the progenitors of the 1970s, both directed by Richard Lester who brought us a gritty and whimsical late renaissance France. This 1998 film is all spit and polish with some emotional flourishes. The production values are all bright and shiny. Even the peasants are well lit, and look like they were made up to look like starving peasants, again, verse the 1970's versions which let the set, actors and story speak for itself. The story is a very interesting one, but the execution looks borderline B-grade film making with a high budget. The shots are uninspired, the sets are sanitized, the costumes are colorful, the fencing, what little there is, is not gripping in the least. There's some humor, but it's so telegraphed and couched in teenage humor sensibilities that it's hardly worth commenting on. I think I laughed once. It is a finely polished production for what it is, but beyond that I would recommend you look for musketeer entertainment elsewhere. See it once, but don't say I didn't warn you.

    A chance to bring the musketeers to the big screen again! Romance, revolution, retribution, ... really?. The film starts sensibly, and dolls out information at a reasonable pace for the first 70% of the movie. The musketeers' performances are acceptable, although every one of Athos's lines is delivered in a tone that I can only describe as Malkovichian. However, Leo is pretty painful to watch as both Louis and Philippe. I'm not sure what's worse, listening to him blunder through Louis's smarmy monologues or watching him feign wistful expressions as Philippe (he knows wistful and listless are distinct emotional states, right?). There's some swashbuckling action, some political intrigue, some subtle (and by subtle I simply mean "not explicit") character development. The final 30% of the movie, though, takes a turn for the melodramatic and completely kills any interest I had established at that point. The film isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good either.

    Had been on a Di Caprio binge and thought I'd reach out into unchartered back catalogue fodder blasts. Pompous costumes, wooden, stilted dialogue and no sight of the man in the iron mask! For a lot of talk of nipples I in fact found this to be a load of balls. Still... it was only the first 10 minutes. Now if Iron Man had turned up then this might be 10 minutes that I won't spend one in every further 10 for the rest of my days wondering how I could ever get them back.

    That's very sad. It's too underrated, and this movie is really good. The story is good and emotional (not in girly way), the cast is nice and talented. I don't know what people were expecting more. Leonardo DiCaprio is such an annoying little brat here, but acts so well. Jeremy Irons delivers such a powerful and empathetic character in a way that you can actually feel and see in his eyes the pain he's going through the whole movie. At the end you find out why Aramis was acting that way towards his old friends that you wonder how he resisted and not broke down in any moment. We have some comic relief coming from G&eacute;rard Depardieu's Porthos. He manages to calm down the tense atmosphere and give some sense of relieve to others as well. He is a very talented actor, and he really made me laugh in this. It deserved some more nominations for sure. At least DiCaprio and Irons whom gave some really wonderful performances. It's very sad. I hope in the future the users will rate this higher. It doesn't deserve 6,3. At least a 7. AT LEAST! Worth watching, very good movie, way underrated. It stands in the 3rd place in my own personal favorite movies of all time (The first is "Les Miserables" 1998, the second is "The painted veil" 2004). 9/10

    I've always been intrigued by the legend of The Man In The Iron Mask. I am also a big fan of the writing of Alexander Dumas. So quite obviously I had high expectations from this movie. I was not disappointed. The story grips you right from the beiging to the very end. The cinematography,costumes and scenery are nothing short of breath taking. The script was written to perfection staying as true to the original Dumas story as it possibly could.The performance from Jermey Irons was good. Unfortunaly the same cannot be said about the rest of the cast. Leonardo Di Caprio was patehic. He constantly speaks with a distinct American accent despite the fact that he is portraying a French King. The same goes for John Malkovich(which surprising considering how talented he is.) On a whole despite some dismal performances, The Man In The Iron Mask is an engrossing tale that should be viewed at least once in your life time.

    I love this movie , Leonardo Dicaprio's performances were stellar! This was a beautiful rendition , of the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas. Though I have seen it many times, it is still one of my favorites. The cast was incredible, and the acting was superb! Especially from the four acclaimed and seasoned actors, who portrayed the aging Musketeers. The only part about this movie, was the mistreatment of the good twin Philipe. Forced to hide his face, and having to live in solitude in a dark dank cell. I really felt sorry for him, because he didn't deserve that punishment! The King (also Dicaprio), was a vindictive spoiled brat especially when he didn't get his way! I didn't care for him to much, but behind the betrayal and deception. There was one character that added levity and that was Portos, I found him to be quite comical! This was one of the best versions of this classic , I have ever seen. I would give it an A++! This is my daughter's take on the movie.I too loved this movie it is just as good as,the one that;Richard Chamberlain was in.

    Oscar-nominated Randall Wallace made his directorial debut with this adaptation of the 1848 classic by Alexandre Dumas, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role in The Man in the Iron Mask.The movie centers on the aging Musketeers Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan and the reign of King Louis XIV of France. It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film. Years have passed since the Three Musketeers, Aramis,Athos, and Porthos fought together with their friend D'Artagnan. The arrogant, tyrannical King Louis XIV desires the beautiful Christine, so he orders her suitor Raoul, the son of Athos, off to face death at the front. He also sends Aramis to kill the leader of a Jesuit rebellion. Louis is unaware that his loyal protector and informant, D'Artagnan, is the secret lover of his mother, Queen Anne. Louis' younger twin brother, Philippe is the man in the iron mask,imprisoned for the past six years. Arthos and Porthos plan to free Philippe, abduct Louis and replace him by putting Philippe on the throne.The four Musketeers and Philippe then charge at Louis's front line. The soldiers are so amazed by their "magnificent valor" that they close their eyes before firing their muskets. The smoke clears to reveal the five men still standing; all the shots, barring a few flesh wounds, missed.An enraged Louis lunges toward Philippe and tries to stab him. However, D'Artagnan jumps between them and is fatally wounded. Philippe knocks Louis down and begins to strangle him, but D'Artagnan, with his dying breaths, reminds Philippe that Louis is his brother. Philippe embraces his father for the first and last time as he dies, commenting that D'Artagnan was the one wearing the mask all along. D'Artagnan's right-hand man, Lieutenant Andre, furious at Louis for killing D'Artagnan, orders his men to leave and swears them to secrecy. By the time another battalion breaks in via another door, the three Musketeers and Lieutenant Andre have made Louis and Philippe swap clothes and locked Louis in the iron mask. Philippe introduces Athos, Porthos and Aramis as his royal council and truest friends. Posing as the King, Philippe orders the guards to take Louis and lock him away. Philippe, Athos, Porthos, Aramis and Queen Anne attend D'Artagnan's funeral, in which the three Musketeers are finally redeemed. After the funeral, Philippe asks Athos to love him like a son and Athos accepts and kisses Philippe's chest. With Louis whom Philippe, for the sake of their blood relation, granted a royal pardon now living in a house in the country, France is at peace under Philippe's rule. The only thing that the movie features is Leonardo DiCaprio in dual roles.Nothing more.I also think that he was some sort of miscast since though a talented actor, DiCaprio is no Errol Flynn. With his choirboy face and chess-club physique, he is scarcely fit to play swashbuckling hero or villain.Overall,it was a poor remake of a frequently told Dumas classic.

    I simply love movies that can entertain and yet, throw some nuggets of wisdom to the viewers. Man in the Iron Mask has couple of dialogues that are like sayings from a wise sage. Rather than reveal anything here, I suggest that you see the flick and hear these for yourself. Here's a good story, music, costumes, art direction, sword fights and also cracking performances from the four musketeers Gabriel Byrne as D'Artagnan, Gerard Depardieu as Porthos, John Malkovich as Athos, Jeremy Irons as Aramis and also Leonardo DiCaprio as King Louise/Phillipe. I truly felt that Leo's acting was outstanding. Even John Malkovich & Gabriel Byrne were class. Some of the lead actors like Judith Godreche as Christine(King Louise's fancy) was average, which was a little disappointing. Besides that, everything in this flick clicks. Verdict: Here's a castle-age movie that you'll never be bored of. All for one, one for all :)

    I watch it over and over again. All actors are well chosen. The director didn't waste the story - on the contrary, he turned it out in a beautiful film, which I watch with pleasure. I was afraid first that Dumas' novel won't come up well on film. But the film turned out to be better than the book. So powerful and impressive performance. Excellent work, the staff didn't miss any detail and didn't ruin the classic story. I am glad Randall Wallace did his job so well and professionally. More historic films would fill our entertainment with more pleasure and I think, would change the values of the young people of our days. Excellent!

This one simply doesn't have the craft, care and ultimate quality that went into the progenitors of the 1970s, both directed by Richard Lester who brought us a gritty and whimsical late renaissance France. This 1998 film is all spit and polish with some emotional flourishes. The production values are all bright and shiny. Even the peasants are well lit, and look like they were made up to look like starving peasants, again, verse the 1970's versions which let the set, actors and story speak for itself. The story is a very interesting one, but the execution looks borderline B-grade film making with a high budget. The shots are uninspired, the sets are sanitized, the costumes are colorful, the fencing, what little there is, is not gripping in the least. There's some humor, but it's so telegraphed and couched in teenage humor sensibilities that it's hardly worth commenting on. I think I laughed once. It is a finely polished production for what it is, but beyond that I would recommend you look for musketeer entertainment elsewhere. See it once, but don't say I didn't warn you.

    A chance to bring the musketeers to the big screen again! Romance, revolution, retribution, ... really?. The film starts sensibly, and dolls out information at a reasonable pace for the first 70% of the movie. The musketeers' performances are acceptable, although every one of Athos's lines is delivered in a tone that I can only describe as Malkovichian. However, Leo is pretty painful to watch as both Louis and Philippe. I'm not sure what's worse, listening to him blunder through Louis's smarmy monologues or watching him feign wistful expressions as Philippe (he knows wistful and listless are distinct emotional states, right?). There's some swashbuckling action, some political intrigue, some subtle (and by subtle I simply mean "not explicit") character development. The final 30% of the movie, though, takes a turn for the melodramatic and completely kills any interest I had established at that point. The film isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good either.

    Had been on a Di Caprio binge and thought I'd reach out into unchartered back catalogue fodder blasts. Pompous costumes, wooden, stilted dialogue and no sight of the man in the iron mask! For a lot of talk of nipples I in fact found this to be a load of balls. Still... it was only the first 10 minutes. Now if Iron Man had turned up then this might be 10 minutes that I won't spend one in every further 10 for the rest of my days wondering how I could ever get them back.

    That's very sad. It's too underrated, and this movie is really good. The story is good and emotional (not in girly way), the cast is nice and talented. I don't know what people were expecting more. Leonardo DiCaprio is such an annoying little brat here, but acts so well. Jeremy Irons delivers such a powerful and empathetic character in a way that you can actually feel and see in his eyes the pain he's going through the whole movie. At the end you find out why Aramis was acting that way towards his old friends that you wonder how he resisted and not broke down in any moment. We have some comic relief coming from G&eacute;rard Depardieu's Porthos. He manages to calm down the tense atmosphere and give some sense of relieve to others as well. He is a very talented actor, and he really made me laugh in this. It deserved some more nominations for sure. At least DiCaprio and Irons whom gave some really wonderful performances. It's very sad. I hope in the future the users will rate this higher. It doesn't deserve 6,3. At least a 7. AT LEAST! Worth watching, very good movie, way underrated. It stands in the 3rd place in my own personal favorite movies of all time (The first is "Les Miserables" 1998, the second is "The painted veil" 2004). 9/10

    I've always been intrigued by the legend of The Man In The Iron Mask. I am also a big fan of the writing of Alexander Dumas. So quite obviously I had high expectations from this movie. I was not disappointed. The story grips you right from the beiging to the very end. The cinematography,costumes and scenery are nothing short of breath taking. The script was written to perfection staying as true to the original Dumas story as it possibly could.The performance from Jermey Irons was good. Unfortunaly the same cannot be said about the rest of the cast. Leonardo Di Caprio was patehic. He constantly speaks with a distinct American accent despite the fact that he is portraying a French King. The same goes for John Malkovich(which surprising considering how talented he is.) On a whole despite some dismal performances, The Man In The Iron Mask is an engrossing tale that should be viewed at least once in your life time.

    I love this movie , Leonardo Dicaprio's performances were stellar! This was a beautiful rendition , of the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas. Though I have seen it many times, it is still one of my favorites. The cast was incredible, and the acting was superb! Especially from the four acclaimed and seasoned actors, who portrayed the aging Musketeers. The only part about this movie, was the mistreatment of the good twin Philipe. Forced to hide his face, and having to live in solitude in a dark dank cell. I really felt sorry for him, because he didn't deserve that punishment! The King (also Dicaprio), was a vindictive spoiled brat especially when he didn't get his way! I didn't care for him to much, but behind the betrayal and deception. There was one character that added levity and that was Portos, I found him to be quite comical! This was one of the best versions of this classic , I have ever seen. I would give it an A++! This is my daughter's take on the movie.I too loved this movie it is just as good as,the one that;Richard Chamberlain was in.

    Oscar-nominated Randall Wallace made his directorial debut with this adaptation of the 1848 classic by Alexandre Dumas, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role in The Man in the Iron Mask.The movie centers on the aging Musketeers Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan and the reign of King Louis XIV of France. It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film. Years have passed since the Three Musketeers, Aramis,Athos, and Porthos fought together with their friend D'Artagnan. The arrogant, tyrannical King Louis XIV desires the beautiful Christine, so he orders her suitor Raoul, the son of Athos, off to face death at the front. He also sends Aramis to kill the leader of a Jesuit rebellion. Louis is unaware that his loyal protector and informant, D'Artagnan, is the secret lover of his mother, Queen Anne. Louis' younger twin brother, Philippe is the man in the iron mask,imprisoned for the past six years. Arthos and Porthos plan to free Philippe, abduct Louis and replace him by putting Philippe on the throne.The four Musketeers and Philippe then charge at Louis's front line. The soldiers are so amazed by their "magnificent valor" that they close their eyes before firing their muskets. The smoke clears to reveal the five men still standing; all the shots, barring a few flesh wounds, missed.An enraged Louis lunges toward Philippe and tries to stab him. However, D'Artagnan jumps between them and is fatally wounded. Philippe knocks Louis down and begins to strangle him, but D'Artagnan, with his dying breaths, reminds Philippe that Louis is his brother. Philippe embraces his father for the first and last time as he dies, commenting that D'Artagnan was the one wearing the mask all along. D'Artagnan's right-hand man, Lieutenant Andre, furious at Louis for killing D'Artagnan, orders his men to leave and swears them to secrecy. By the time another battalion breaks in via another door, the three Musketeers and Lieutenant Andre have made Louis and Philippe swap clothes and locked Louis in the iron mask. Philippe introduces Athos, Porthos and Aramis as his royal council and truest friends. Posing as the King, Philippe orders the guards to take Louis and lock him away. Philippe, Athos, Porthos, Aramis and Queen Anne attend D'Artagnan's funeral, in which the three Musketeers are finally redeemed. After the funeral, Philippe asks Athos to love him like a son and Athos accepts and kisses Philippe's chest. With Louis whom Philippe, for the sake of their blood relation, granted a royal pardon now living in a house in the country, France is at peace under Philippe's rule. The only thing that the movie features is Leonardo DiCaprio in dual roles.Nothing more.I also think that he was some sort of miscast since though a talented actor, DiCaprio is no Errol Flynn. With his choirboy face and chess-club physique, he is scarcely fit to play swashbuckling hero or villain.Overall,it was a poor remake of a frequently told Dumas classic.

    I simply love movies that can entertain and yet, throw some nuggets of wisdom to the viewers. Man in the Iron Mask has couple of dialogues that are like sayings from a wise sage. Rather than reveal anything here, I suggest that you see the flick and hear these for yourself. Here's a good story, music, costumes, art direction, sword fights and also cracking performances from the four musketeers Gabriel Byrne as D'Artagnan, Gerard Depardieu as Porthos, John Malkovich as Athos, Jeremy Irons as Aramis and also Leonardo DiCaprio as King Louise/Phillipe. I truly felt that Leo's acting was outstanding. Even John Malkovich & Gabriel Byrne were class. Some of the lead actors like Judith Godreche as Christine(King Louise's fancy) was average, which was a little disappointing. Besides that, everything in this flick clicks. Verdict: Here's a castle-age movie that you'll never be bored of. All for one, one for all :)

    I watch it over and over again. All actors are well chosen. The director didn't waste the story - on the contrary, he turned it out in a beautiful film, which I watch with pleasure. I was afraid first that Dumas' novel won't come up well on film. But the film turned out to be better than the book. So powerful and impressive performance. Excellent work, the staff didn't miss any detail and didn't ruin the classic story. I am glad Randall Wallace did his job so well and professionally. More historic films would fill our entertainment with more pleasure and I think, would change the values of the young people of our days. Excellent!

    Directed, Produced, & Written by Randall Wallace, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is one of the finest entertainers from the late 90's. A Well-Acted & Well-Directed Film, that is a good mix of drama & humor. 'The Man in the Iron Mask' Synopsis: The cruel King Louis XIV of France has a secret twin brother who he keeps imprisoned. Can the twin be substituted for the real king? What makes 'The Man in the Iron Mask' work, is its engaging story, that isn't dry of dark, but, in fact, dramatic, humorous & even emotional, at places. Wallace's Screenplay deserves brownie points for bringing in almost every element in this adventure film. Wallace's is skilled. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are amazing. Costume Design is perfect. Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent. He plays both the parts with diversity & immense confidence. Jeremy Irons is highly effective. John Malkovich is, as always, flawless. G&eacute;rard Depardieu raises some great laughs. Gabriel Byrne is simply mesmerizing. He is the real scene-stealer here. Hugh Laurie leaves a mark. On the whole, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is an adventure worth watching.

However, Leo is pretty painful to watch as both Louis and Philippe. I'm not sure what's worse, listening to him blunder through Louis's smarmy monologues or watching him feign wistful expressions as Philippe (he knows wistful and listless are distinct emotional states, right?). There's some swashbuckling action, some political intrigue, some subtle (and by subtle I simply mean "not explicit") character development. The final 30% of the movie, though, takes a turn for the melodramatic and completely kills any interest I had established at that point. The film isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good either.

    Had been on a Di Caprio binge and thought I'd reach out into unchartered back catalogue fodder blasts. Pompous costumes, wooden, stilted dialogue and no sight of the man in the iron mask! For a lot of talk of nipples I in fact found this to be a load of balls. Still... it was only the first 10 minutes. Now if Iron Man had turned up then this might be 10 minutes that I won't spend one in every further 10 for the rest of my days wondering how I could ever get them back.

    That's very sad. It's too underrated, and this movie is really good. The story is good and emotional (not in girly way), the cast is nice and talented. I don't know what people were expecting more. Leonardo DiCaprio is such an annoying little brat here, but acts so well. Jeremy Irons delivers such a powerful and empathetic character in a way that you can actually feel and see in his eyes the pain he's going through the whole movie. At the end you find out why Aramis was acting that way towards his old friends that you wonder how he resisted and not broke down in any moment. We have some comic relief coming from G&eacute;rard Depardieu's Porthos. He manages to calm down the tense atmosphere and give some sense of relieve to others as well. He is a very talented actor, and he really made me laugh in this. It deserved some more nominations for sure. At least DiCaprio and Irons whom gave some really wonderful performances. It's very sad. I hope in the future the users will rate this higher. It doesn't deserve 6,3. At least a 7. AT LEAST! Worth watching, very good movie, way underrated. It stands in the 3rd place in my own personal favorite movies of all time (The first is "Les Miserables" 1998, the second is "The painted veil" 2004). 9/10

    I've always been intrigued by the legend of The Man In The Iron Mask. I am also a big fan of the writing of Alexander Dumas. So quite obviously I had high expectations from this movie. I was not disappointed. The story grips you right from the beiging to the very end. The cinematography,costumes and scenery are nothing short of breath taking. The script was written to perfection staying as true to the original Dumas story as it possibly could.The performance from Jermey Irons was good. Unfortunaly the same cannot be said about the rest of the cast. Leonardo Di Caprio was patehic. He constantly speaks with a distinct American accent despite the fact that he is portraying a French King. The same goes for John Malkovich(which surprising considering how talented he is.) On a whole despite some dismal performances, The Man In The Iron Mask is an engrossing tale that should be viewed at least once in your life time.

    I love this movie , Leonardo Dicaprio's performances were stellar! This was a beautiful rendition , of the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas. Though I have seen it many times, it is still one of my favorites. The cast was incredible, and the acting was superb! Especially from the four acclaimed and seasoned actors, who portrayed the aging Musketeers. The only part about this movie, was the mistreatment of the good twin Philipe. Forced to hide his face, and having to live in solitude in a dark dank cell. I really felt sorry for him, because he didn't deserve that punishment! The King (also Dicaprio), was a vindictive spoiled brat especially when he didn't get his way! I didn't care for him to much, but behind the betrayal and deception. There was one character that added levity and that was Portos, I found him to be quite comical! This was one of the best versions of this classic , I have ever seen. I would give it an A++! This is my daughter's take on the movie.I too loved this movie it is just as good as,the one that;Richard Chamberlain was in.

    Oscar-nominated Randall Wallace made his directorial debut with this adaptation of the 1848 classic by Alexandre Dumas, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio in a dual role in The Man in the Iron Mask.The movie centers on the aging Musketeers Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan and the reign of King Louis XIV of France. It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film. Years have passed since the Three Musketeers, Aramis,Athos, and Porthos fought together with their friend D'Artagnan. The arrogant, tyrannical King Louis XIV desires the beautiful Christine, so he orders her suitor Raoul, the son of Athos, off to face death at the front. He also sends Aramis to kill the leader of a Jesuit rebellion. Louis is unaware that his loyal protector and informant, D'Artagnan, is the secret lover of his mother, Queen Anne. Louis' younger twin brother, Philippe is the man in the iron mask,imprisoned for the past six years. Arthos and Porthos plan to free Philippe, abduct Louis and replace him by putting Philippe on the throne.The four Musketeers and Philippe then charge at Louis's front line. The soldiers are so amazed by their "magnificent valor" that they close their eyes before firing their muskets. The smoke clears to reveal the five men still standing; all the shots, barring a few flesh wounds, missed.An enraged Louis lunges toward Philippe and tries to stab him. However, D'Artagnan jumps between them and is fatally wounded. Philippe knocks Louis down and begins to strangle him, but D'Artagnan, with his dying breaths, reminds Philippe that Louis is his brother. Philippe embraces his father for the first and last time as he dies, commenting that D'Artagnan was the one wearing the mask all along. D'Artagnan's right-hand man, Lieutenant Andre, furious at Louis for killing D'Artagnan, orders his men to leave and swears them to secrecy. By the time another battalion breaks in via another door, the three Musketeers and Lieutenant Andre have made Louis and Philippe swap clothes and locked Louis in the iron mask. Philippe introduces Athos, Porthos and Aramis as his royal council and truest friends. Posing as the King, Philippe orders the guards to take Louis and lock him away. Philippe, Athos, Porthos, Aramis and Queen Anne attend D'Artagnan's funeral, in which the three Musketeers are finally redeemed. After the funeral, Philippe asks Athos to love him like a son and Athos accepts and kisses Philippe's chest. With Louis whom Philippe, for the sake of their blood relation, granted a royal pardon now living in a house in the country, France is at peace under Philippe's rule. The only thing that the movie features is Leonardo DiCaprio in dual roles.Nothing more.I also think that he was some sort of miscast since though a talented actor, DiCaprio is no Errol Flynn. With his choirboy face and chess-club physique, he is scarcely fit to play swashbuckling hero or villain.Overall,it was a poor remake of a frequently told Dumas classic.

    I simply love movies that can entertain and yet, throw some nuggets of wisdom to the viewers. Man in the Iron Mask has couple of dialogues that are like sayings from a wise sage. Rather than reveal anything here, I suggest that you see the flick and hear these for yourself. Here's a good story, music, costumes, art direction, sword fights and also cracking performances from the four musketeers Gabriel Byrne as D'Artagnan, Gerard Depardieu as Porthos, John Malkovich as Athos, Jeremy Irons as Aramis and also Leonardo DiCaprio as King Louise/Phillipe. I truly felt that Leo's acting was outstanding. Even John Malkovich & Gabriel Byrne were class. Some of the lead actors like Judith Godreche as Christine(King Louise's fancy) was average, which was a little disappointing. Besides that, everything in this flick clicks. Verdict: Here's a castle-age movie that you'll never be bored of. All for one, one for all :)

    I watch it over and over again. All actors are well chosen. The director didn't waste the story - on the contrary, he turned it out in a beautiful film, which I watch with pleasure. I was afraid first that Dumas' novel won't come up well on film. But the film turned out to be better than the book. So powerful and impressive performance. Excellent work, the staff didn't miss any detail and didn't ruin the classic story. I am glad Randall Wallace did his job so well and professionally. More historic films would fill our entertainment with more pleasure and I think, would change the values of the young people of our days. Excellent!

    Directed, Produced, & Written by Randall Wallace, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is one of the finest entertainers from the late 90's. A Well-Acted & Well-Directed Film, that is a good mix of drama & humor. 'The Man in the Iron Mask' Synopsis: The cruel King Louis XIV of France has a secret twin brother who he keeps imprisoned. Can the twin be substituted for the real king? What makes 'The Man in the Iron Mask' work, is its engaging story, that isn't dry of dark, but, in fact, dramatic, humorous & even emotional, at places. Wallace's Screenplay deserves brownie points for bringing in almost every element in this adventure film. Wallace's is skilled. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are amazing. Costume Design is perfect. Performance-Wise: Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent. He plays both the parts with diversity & immense confidence. Jeremy Irons is highly effective. John Malkovich is, as always, flawless. G&eacute;rard Depardieu raises some great laughs. Gabriel Byrne is simply mesmerizing. He is the real scene-stealer here. Hugh Laurie leaves a mark. On the whole, 'The Man in the Iron Mask' is an adventure worth watching.

    I'm rating this film as mediocre because to me the Salkind productions are the gold standard for musketeer films. This one simply doesn't have the craft, care and ultimate quality that went into the progenitors of the 1970s, both directed by Richard Lester who brought us a gritty and whimsical late renaissance France. This 1998 film is all spit and polish with some emotional flourishes. The production values are all bright and shiny. Even the peasants are well lit, and look like they were made up to look like starving peasants, again, verse the 1970's versions which let the set, actors and story speak for itself. The story is a very interesting one, but the execution looks borderline B-grade film making with a high budget. The shots are uninspired, the sets are sanitized, the costumes are colorful, the fencing, what little there is, is not gripping in the least. There's some humor, but it's so telegraphed and couched in teenage humor sensibilities that it's hardly worth commenting on. I think I laughed once. It is a finely polished production for what it is, but beyond that I would recommend you look for musketeer entertainment elsewhere. See it once, but don't say I didn't warn you.

    A chance to bring the musketeers to the big screen again! Romance, revolution, retribution, ... really?. The film starts sensibly, and dolls out information at a reasonable pace for the first 70% of the movie. The musketeers' performances are acceptable, although every one of Athos's lines is delivered in a tone that I can only describe as Malkovichian. However, Leo is pretty painful to watch as both Louis and Philippe.
