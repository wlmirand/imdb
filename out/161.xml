 <sinopse>
  As students at the Navy's elite fighter weapons school compete to be best in the class, one daring young flyer learns a few things from a civilian instructor that are not taught in the classroom.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Maverick is a hot pilot. When he encounters a pair of MiGs over the Persian Gulf, his wingman is clearly outflown and freaks. On almost no fuel, Maverick is able to talk him back down to the Carrier. When his wingman turns in his wings, Maverick is moved up in the standings and sent to the Top Gun Naval Flying School. There he fights the attitudes of the other pilots and an old story of his father's death in combat that killed others due to his father's error. Maverick struggles to be the best pilot, stepping on the toes of his other students and in a different way to Charlie, a civilian instructor to whom he is strongly attracted.

    Tom Cruise stars as a super-confident navy flier(Maverick) sent to the prestigious Top Gun program to become "the best of the best", along with friend Anthony Edwards(The Goose). Film details their ups and downs, trials and tribulations learning to control their arrogance and graduate from the program, with the help of their love interests(Kelly McGillis & Meg Ryan) High-octane adventure is pretty clich&eacute;d, but incredibly entertaining and energetic, with many rousing scenes, and spectacular aerial action and(at the time) state of the art aircraft. Romance with McGillis is not credible, but a small issue in such a fun movie, a guilty pleasure of sorts, though a blockbuster hit in 1986!

    I can't believe that people think this is cool! The music is mostly taken from the deepest deep of the sh*t-hole known as: the 80's, and even the theme song sucks, considering Harold Faltermeyer made "Axel F". It all begins with the credits, it's slow, I guess they wanted all the names in the beginning, since it's hard to even stay awake, and the title reveal is cheap, and laughable. The action scene in the beginning was generic, and the music made it even worse, it was so out of place. Everything is very cheezy, and the scene where they play beach volley ball is just pathetic, it's clearly to get views from women, it's like "80's Twilight". I watched this because my dad wanted to show me how bad it is, so this is all coming from someone who's not even 18, and still has better taste than you. The movie was mostly so f*cking bad, that it was FUNNY, so I guess it's still a bit entertaining, but considering what was intended, I give it: 2/10, f*cking terrible, I gave it some more time, and I'm changing it from 4 to 2, it SUCKS.

    TOP GUN Back to the 80s this is a classic movie. I have seen it quite a few times now, but I felt that I had to introduce my daughter to the classic now she has turned 12. The movie is about a group of fighter pilots who are the best in the world that are trained as the elite of the elite. I really like the film. It has great action scenes and an actual story. Unfortunately it is a love story. A love story between a student and one of the instructors. Tom Cruise is the main character. He is a reckless pilot who likes to mess around and joke about in the air, which gets him in trouble from time to time but he is one of the best. Tom did a good job, but he is a very good actor anyway so this is no surprise. This was one of his earlier roles and it is easy to see how he has had such a huge career after this. His partner in the air is played by Anthony Edwards. I remember watching Anthony in E.R. a lot and was shocked to be reminded that he was in Top Gun. But he did a great job. Other cast members are Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis, Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Tim Robbins, James Tolkan & Meg Ryan. The casting is great and they all work very well together. The action scenes in the air were very well done and there were some great fighting scenes. There was some funny moments in the film, sad moments and exhilarating moments. This film was very well put together and was an emotional ride. The film has a great soundtrack too some classic songs from the 80s which never gets old. Yes, some of the songs are super cheesy, but that is what makes this film a classic. There are so many great quotes that come out of this film. It is well known for the singing scene in the bar. Possibly the worst chat up line ever! I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a classic, but nowhere near as good as some of the other movies to come out of the 80s. My daughter liked it which was the whole point of watching it again. "I feel the need... The need for speed!"

    One word to describe this movie: Incredible Usually I enjoy most the movies that seem to have a high rating, and seem to agree with the mainstream opinions. It is not my choice to be like that, and I am very glad that there are a few movies that really show that I have my own opinions about cinema, this being the best of them. I have seen this movie very many times, and never get tired of it. I can't believe it only has 6.5, it is a near-to-perfect movie of its kind in my opinion. Tom Cruise is perfect for the role of Maverick. Literally. The cast is great, and so are the editing and directing. This has got to be the coolest movie I've ever seen, yet it also has such a great storyline. It has a place in my all-time top 10 movies, and is maybe the most nostalgic movie to me. The soundtrack is freaking incredible! It is impossible for me to listen to the Top Gun Anthem without smiling and feeling truly victorious. I mean, that song defines victory, just as this movie defines cool. The Anthem is an epic song and the best of the soundtrack, but I also love Highway to the Danger Zone, Take My Breath Away and Mighty Wings very much. The songs go perfectly together, and the beginning of the movie is maybe my favorite opening scene ever, much thanks to the soundtrack. This movie is very special to me, and I recommend it to anyone who seeks to simply enjoy a good movie and not be too critical about it.

    Top Gun is a 80s classic. The good. Interesting academy rivalry. Nice choice of music and score. Great footage of fighter planes. Beautiful San Diego photography. Funny scenes. The actors. Tom Cruise plays the hothead excellently. Val Kilmer as his ice cool competitor is just perfect. However, the best and smoothest work is done by Meg Ryan. On the other hand, Kelly McGillis is unfortunately performed poorly and wasn't given much to work with. The rest of the cast does a pretty solid job. I'll just mention the better ones: Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt, and Michael Ironside. We can also see a small cameo by Tim Robbins. The bad. Easy dialogs. Poor romance plot with lots of clich&eacute; and a weak female lead. A few continuity problems. Cockpit filming, lighting conditions mainly, doesn't correspond to fighter plane footage. The ugly. Very awkward stick handling that looks ridiculous. The result. A classic, mainly for those interested in seeing what really launched Cruise's career.

    "I feel the need, the need for speed!" Top Gun is without any doubt one of the iconic movies of the 80's and marked Tom Cruise's international stardom after Risky Business another successful picture. The late Tony Scott directed a brilliant film based on fighter pilots in the Navy who aspire to become the best of the best in this exciting action drama starring Tom as the charismatic Pete "Maverick" Mitchell and his love affair with his instructor Charlie Blackwood played by Kelly McGillis and let's not forget Tom Skerritt, Anthony Edwards and Meg Ryan who delivered unforgettable performances. The dogfighting scenes involving F-14A Tomcats are perfect and believable without today's visual effects, in addition to the movie's soundtrack with its great songs. Top Gun is a masterpiece movie for everybody.

    'Maverick' is a hotshot pilot for the navy, that is, when he's not riding his bike or playing volleyball at the beach. Tom Cruise as 'Mav' is claimed by some to be "bigger than life" while the rest of us see him as he really appears -- somebody's kid brother, the squirt you don't want tagging along when you go to the movies with your significant other. Exciting flying scenes, a charged-up soundtrack, and the most unbelievable plot ever (until '50 First Dates'), made this sailor tripe a hit at the box office. Thank God Val Kilmer is around to give the chicks in the audience a good-looking guy to stare at, because shrimpy Tom Cruise ain't it. Recommended for aviation buffs and fans of military comedies.

    Top Gun is a good movie for those 12 and up. Top Gun touches us on many levels. It touches our intellect level by showing how important school (classroom) is in learning to be a good fighter pilot. It touches our heart by the romance between Tom Cruise and Meg Ryan. It touches our need for adventure and competition with the air flights and competition between pilots. However, it is competition and adventure with a purpose, to give the knowledge to survive. Top gun may even be an inspiring film to get people to enroll in the US Military as fight pilots or support air staff. Top Gun is entertaining as well. I thought that Michael Ironside made a good flight instructor. I give the film seven thumbs up. A slightly memorable film, and love does conquer all.

    All I need to say about this film, which sure impressed a lot of teen and twenties folk, is how ridiculous it is to see the flight deck of an aircraft carrier during a warlike confrontation, covered by cheering sailors who respond to the events as if they are watching them on a big screen . . . running a carrier is a minute-by-minute life threatening business, where the slightest inattention may result in grave injury if not death. "Maverick" would have been axed the first time he blatantly risked his aircraft, crew, and shipmates. I realize part of cinema is suspending disbelief to some extent, but other than some nice cinematography, this movie fails on so many levels.

    Top Gun (1986) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Blockbuster about hot shot pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) who gets a chance to show his stuff against the best Navy pilots in the world but soon his ways are challenged by another flier (Val Kilmer) who thinks he's too dangerous to be trusted. TOP GUN contains many flaws but at the same time there's no way you can deny the fact that it's rather entertaining, features a terrific cast and of course it turned Cruise into a major Hollywood star. We'll start with the negative stuff first. The biggest problem is without question the screenplay, which is just way too predictable for its own good. I mean, there are several twists in the story but there's not a single scene that you won't see coming from a mile away. We're introduced to a hot shot, we learn about his sad past, we see him fall for a strong woman (Kelly McGillis), we see him lose strong woman, we see a tragedy, we see him give up and of course we haven't even gotten to the predictable ending. I'm not saying the story had to be something hard-hitting or ground-breaking but there's no question that something not so predictable would have been good. As for the good stuff, you certainly can't overlook the terrific action scenes that are perfectly directed by Tony Scott. The director really makes you feel as if you're on board one of these jets and there's no question that there's some tense action throughout. Another major plus is that the cast is simply terrific as there are so many future stars here. Cruise, as you'd expect, has no problem playing the hot shot who soon starts to question what everyone is saying about him. You also have Kilmer turning in a good supporting part, although you have to wonder if he really wanted to be doing this character. Anthony Edwards, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, Michael Ironside and Tom Skerritt add nice support as well. I thought McGillis wasn't the typical actress you'd find in a romance like this but there's no question that she's good in the part. The soundtrack is full of "B" summer hits that add a little camp value. TOP GUN certainly isn't a perfect film but at least it's entertaining and as I said, it's always fun see so many stars in early roles.

The soundtrack is full of "B" summer hits that add a little camp value. TOP GUN certainly isn't a perfect film but at least it's entertaining and as I said, it's always fun see so many stars in early roles.

    Tom Cruise stars as a super-confident navy flier(Maverick) sent to the prestigious Top Gun program to become "the best of the best", along with friend Anthony Edwards(The Goose). Film details their ups and downs, trials and tribulations learning to control their arrogance and graduate from the program, with the help of their love interests(Kelly McGillis & Meg Ryan) High-octane adventure is pretty clich&eacute;d, but incredibly entertaining and energetic, with many rousing scenes, and spectacular aerial action and(at the time) state of the art aircraft. Romance with McGillis is not credible, but a small issue in such a fun movie, a guilty pleasure of sorts, though a blockbuster hit in 1986!

    I can't believe that people think this is cool! The music is mostly taken from the deepest deep of the sh*t-hole known as: the 80's, and even the theme song sucks, considering Harold Faltermeyer made "Axel F". It all begins with the credits, it's slow, I guess they wanted all the names in the beginning, since it's hard to even stay awake, and the title reveal is cheap, and laughable. The action scene in the beginning was generic, and the music made it even worse, it was so out of place. Everything is very cheezy, and the scene where they play beach volley ball is just pathetic, it's clearly to get views from women, it's like "80's Twilight". I watched this because my dad wanted to show me how bad it is, so this is all coming from someone who's not even 18, and still has better taste than you. The movie was mostly so f*cking bad, that it was FUNNY, so I guess it's still a bit entertaining, but considering what was intended, I give it: 2/10, f*cking terrible, I gave it some more time, and I'm changing it from 4 to 2, it SUCKS.

    TOP GUN Back to the 80s this is a classic movie. I have seen it quite a few times now, but I felt that I had to introduce my daughter to the classic now she has turned 12. The movie is about a group of fighter pilots who are the best in the world that are trained as the elite of the elite. I really like the film. It has great action scenes and an actual story. Unfortunately it is a love story. A love story between a student and one of the instructors. Tom Cruise is the main character. He is a reckless pilot who likes to mess around and joke about in the air, which gets him in trouble from time to time but he is one of the best. Tom did a good job, but he is a very good actor anyway so this is no surprise. This was one of his earlier roles and it is easy to see how he has had such a huge career after this. His partner in the air is played by Anthony Edwards. I remember watching Anthony in E.R. a lot and was shocked to be reminded that he was in Top Gun. But he did a great job. Other cast members are Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis, Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Tim Robbins, James Tolkan & Meg Ryan. The casting is great and they all work very well together. The action scenes in the air were very well done and there were some great fighting scenes. There was some funny moments in the film, sad moments and exhilarating moments. This film was very well put together and was an emotional ride. The film has a great soundtrack too some classic songs from the 80s which never gets old. Yes, some of the songs are super cheesy, but that is what makes this film a classic. There are so many great quotes that come out of this film. It is well known for the singing scene in the bar. Possibly the worst chat up line ever! I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a classic, but nowhere near as good as some of the other movies to come out of the 80s. My daughter liked it which was the whole point of watching it again. "I feel the need... The need for speed!"

    One word to describe this movie: Incredible Usually I enjoy most the movies that seem to have a high rating, and seem to agree with the mainstream opinions. It is not my choice to be like that, and I am very glad that there are a few movies that really show that I have my own opinions about cinema, this being the best of them. I have seen this movie very many times, and never get tired of it. I can't believe it only has 6.5, it is a near-to-perfect movie of its kind in my opinion. Tom Cruise is perfect for the role of Maverick. Literally. The cast is great, and so are the editing and directing. This has got to be the coolest movie I've ever seen, yet it also has such a great storyline. It has a place in my all-time top 10 movies, and is maybe the most nostalgic movie to me. The soundtrack is freaking incredible! It is impossible for me to listen to the Top Gun Anthem without smiling and feeling truly victorious. I mean, that song defines victory, just as this movie defines cool. The Anthem is an epic song and the best of the soundtrack, but I also love Highway to the Danger Zone, Take My Breath Away and Mighty Wings very much. The songs go perfectly together, and the beginning of the movie is maybe my favorite opening scene ever, much thanks to the soundtrack. This movie is very special to me, and I recommend it to anyone who seeks to simply enjoy a good movie and not be too critical about it.

    Top Gun is a 80s classic. The good. Interesting academy rivalry. Nice choice of music and score. Great footage of fighter planes. Beautiful San Diego photography. Funny scenes. The actors. Tom Cruise plays the hothead excellently. Val Kilmer as his ice cool competitor is just perfect. However, the best and smoothest work is done by Meg Ryan. On the other hand, Kelly McGillis is unfortunately performed poorly and wasn't given much to work with. The rest of the cast does a pretty solid job. I'll just mention the better ones: Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt, and Michael Ironside. We can also see a small cameo by Tim Robbins. The bad. Easy dialogs. Poor romance plot with lots of clich&eacute; and a weak female lead. A few continuity problems. Cockpit filming, lighting conditions mainly, doesn't correspond to fighter plane footage. The ugly. Very awkward stick handling that looks ridiculous. The result. A classic, mainly for those interested in seeing what really launched Cruise's career.

    "I feel the need, the need for speed!" Top Gun is without any doubt one of the iconic movies of the 80's and marked Tom Cruise's international stardom after Risky Business another successful picture. The late Tony Scott directed a brilliant film based on fighter pilots in the Navy who aspire to become the best of the best in this exciting action drama starring Tom as the charismatic Pete "Maverick" Mitchell and his love affair with his instructor Charlie Blackwood played by Kelly McGillis and let's not forget Tom Skerritt, Anthony Edwards and Meg Ryan who delivered unforgettable performances. The dogfighting scenes involving F-14A Tomcats are perfect and believable without today's visual effects, in addition to the movie's soundtrack with its great songs. Top Gun is a masterpiece movie for everybody.

    'Maverick' is a hotshot pilot for the navy, that is, when he's not riding his bike or playing volleyball at the beach. Tom Cruise as 'Mav' is claimed by some to be "bigger than life" while the rest of us see him as he really appears -- somebody's kid brother, the squirt you don't want tagging along when you go to the movies with your significant other. Exciting flying scenes, a charged-up soundtrack, and the most unbelievable plot ever (until '50 First Dates'), made this sailor tripe a hit at the box office. Thank God Val Kilmer is around to give the chicks in the audience a good-looking guy to stare at, because shrimpy Tom Cruise ain't it. Recommended for aviation buffs and fans of military comedies.

    Top Gun is a good movie for those 12 and up. Top Gun touches us on many levels. It touches our intellect level by showing how important school (classroom) is in learning to be a good fighter pilot. It touches our heart by the romance between Tom Cruise and Meg Ryan. It touches our need for adventure and competition with the air flights and competition between pilots. However, it is competition and adventure with a purpose, to give the knowledge to survive. Top gun may even be an inspiring film to get people to enroll in the US Military as fight pilots or support air staff. Top Gun is entertaining as well. I thought that Michael Ironside made a good flight instructor. I give the film seven thumbs up. A slightly memorable film, and love does conquer all.

    All I need to say about this film, which sure impressed a lot of teen and twenties folk, is how ridiculous it is to see the flight deck of an aircraft carrier during a warlike confrontation, covered by cheering sailors who respond to the events as if they are watching them on a big screen . . . running a carrier is a minute-by-minute life threatening business, where the slightest inattention may result in grave injury if not death. "Maverick" would have been axed the first time he blatantly risked his aircraft, crew, and shipmates. I realize part of cinema is suspending disbelief to some extent, but other than some nice cinematography, this movie fails on so many levels.

    Top Gun (1986) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Blockbuster about hot shot pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) who gets a chance to show his stuff against the best Navy pilots in the world but soon his ways are challenged by another flier (Val Kilmer) who thinks he's too dangerous to be trusted. TOP GUN contains many flaws but at the same time there's no way you can deny the fact that it's rather entertaining, features a terrific cast and of course it turned Cruise into a major Hollywood star. We'll start with the negative stuff first. The biggest problem is without question the screenplay, which is just way too predictable for its own good. I mean, there are several twists in the story but there's not a single scene that you won't see coming from a mile away. We're introduced to a hot shot, we learn about his sad past, we see him fall for a strong woman (Kelly McGillis), we see him lose strong woman, we see a tragedy, we see him give up and of course we haven't even gotten to the predictable ending. I'm not saying the story had to be something hard-hitting or ground-breaking but there's no question that something not so predictable would have been good. As for the good stuff, you certainly can't overlook the terrific action scenes that are perfectly directed by Tony Scott. The director really makes you feel as if you're on board one of these jets and there's no question that there's some tense action throughout. Another major plus is that the cast is simply terrific as there are so many future stars here. Cruise, as you'd expect, has no problem playing the hot shot who soon starts to question what everyone is saying about him. You also have Kilmer turning in a good supporting part, although you have to wonder if he really wanted to be doing this character. Anthony Edwards, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, Michael Ironside and Tom Skerritt add nice support as well. I thought McGillis wasn't the typical actress you'd find in a romance like this but there's no question that she's good in the part. The soundtrack is full of "B" summer hits that add a little camp value. TOP GUN certainly isn't a perfect film but at least it's entertaining and as I said, it's always fun see so many stars in early roles.

The action scene in the beginning was generic, and the music made it even worse, it was so out of place. Everything is very cheezy, and the scene where they play beach volley ball is just pathetic, it's clearly to get views from women, it's like "80's Twilight". I watched this because my dad wanted to show me how bad it is, so this is all coming from someone who's not even 18, and still has better taste than you. The movie was mostly so f*cking bad, that it was FUNNY, so I guess it's still a bit entertaining, but considering what was intended, I give it: 2/10, f*cking terrible, I gave it some more time, and I'm changing it from 4 to 2, it SUCKS.

    TOP GUN Back to the 80s this is a classic movie. I have seen it quite a few times now, but I felt that I had to introduce my daughter to the classic now she has turned 12. The movie is about a group of fighter pilots who are the best in the world that are trained as the elite of the elite. I really like the film. It has great action scenes and an actual story. Unfortunately it is a love story. A love story between a student and one of the instructors. Tom Cruise is the main character. He is a reckless pilot who likes to mess around and joke about in the air, which gets him in trouble from time to time but he is one of the best. Tom did a good job, but he is a very good actor anyway so this is no surprise. This was one of his earlier roles and it is easy to see how he has had such a huge career after this. His partner in the air is played by Anthony Edwards. I remember watching Anthony in E.R. a lot and was shocked to be reminded that he was in Top Gun. But he did a great job. Other cast members are Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis, Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Tim Robbins, James Tolkan & Meg Ryan. The casting is great and they all work very well together. The action scenes in the air were very well done and there were some great fighting scenes. There was some funny moments in the film, sad moments and exhilarating moments. This film was very well put together and was an emotional ride. The film has a great soundtrack too some classic songs from the 80s which never gets old. Yes, some of the songs are super cheesy, but that is what makes this film a classic. There are so many great quotes that come out of this film. It is well known for the singing scene in the bar. Possibly the worst chat up line ever! I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a classic, but nowhere near as good as some of the other movies to come out of the 80s. My daughter liked it which was the whole point of watching it again. "I feel the need... The need for speed!"

    One word to describe this movie: Incredible Usually I enjoy most the movies that seem to have a high rating, and seem to agree with the mainstream opinions. It is not my choice to be like that, and I am very glad that there are a few movies that really show that I have my own opinions about cinema, this being the best of them. I have seen this movie very many times, and never get tired of it. I can't believe it only has 6.5, it is a near-to-perfect movie of its kind in my opinion. Tom Cruise is perfect for the role of Maverick. Literally. The cast is great, and so are the editing and directing. This has got to be the coolest movie I've ever seen, yet it also has such a great storyline. It has a place in my all-time top 10 movies, and is maybe the most nostalgic movie to me. The soundtrack is freaking incredible! It is impossible for me to listen to the Top Gun Anthem without smiling and feeling truly victorious. I mean, that song defines victory, just as this movie defines cool. The Anthem is an epic song and the best of the soundtrack, but I also love Highway to the Danger Zone, Take My Breath Away and Mighty Wings very much. The songs go perfectly together, and the beginning of the movie is maybe my favorite opening scene ever, much thanks to the soundtrack. This movie is very special to me, and I recommend it to anyone who seeks to simply enjoy a good movie and not be too critical about it.

    Top Gun is a 80s classic. The good. Interesting academy rivalry. Nice choice of music and score. Great footage of fighter planes. Beautiful San Diego photography. Funny scenes. The actors. Tom Cruise plays the hothead excellently. Val Kilmer as his ice cool competitor is just perfect. However, the best and smoothest work is done by Meg Ryan. On the other hand, Kelly McGillis is unfortunately performed poorly and wasn't given much to work with. The rest of the cast does a pretty solid job. I'll just mention the better ones: Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt, and Michael Ironside. We can also see a small cameo by Tim Robbins. The bad. Easy dialogs. Poor romance plot with lots of clich&eacute; and a weak female lead. A few continuity problems. Cockpit filming, lighting conditions mainly, doesn't correspond to fighter plane footage. The ugly. Very awkward stick handling that looks ridiculous. The result. A classic, mainly for those interested in seeing what really launched Cruise's career.

    "I feel the need, the need for speed!" Top Gun is without any doubt one of the iconic movies of the 80's and marked Tom Cruise's international stardom after Risky Business another successful picture. The late Tony Scott directed a brilliant film based on fighter pilots in the Navy who aspire to become the best of the best in this exciting action drama starring Tom as the charismatic Pete "Maverick" Mitchell and his love affair with his instructor Charlie Blackwood played by Kelly McGillis and let's not forget Tom Skerritt, Anthony Edwards and Meg Ryan who delivered unforgettable performances. The dogfighting scenes involving F-14A Tomcats are perfect and believable without today's visual effects, in addition to the movie's soundtrack with its great songs. Top Gun is a masterpiece movie for everybody.

    'Maverick' is a hotshot pilot for the navy, that is, when he's not riding his bike or playing volleyball at the beach. Tom Cruise as 'Mav' is claimed by some to be "bigger than life" while the rest of us see him as he really appears -- somebody's kid brother, the squirt you don't want tagging along when you go to the movies with your significant other. Exciting flying scenes, a charged-up soundtrack, and the most unbelievable plot ever (until '50 First Dates'), made this sailor tripe a hit at the box office. Thank God Val Kilmer is around to give the chicks in the audience a good-looking guy to stare at, because shrimpy Tom Cruise ain't it. Recommended for aviation buffs and fans of military comedies.

    Top Gun is a good movie for those 12 and up. Top Gun touches us on many levels. It touches our intellect level by showing how important school (classroom) is in learning to be a good fighter pilot. It touches our heart by the romance between Tom Cruise and Meg Ryan. It touches our need for adventure and competition with the air flights and competition between pilots. However, it is competition and adventure with a purpose, to give the knowledge to survive. Top gun may even be an inspiring film to get people to enroll in the US Military as fight pilots or support air staff. Top Gun is entertaining as well. I thought that Michael Ironside made a good flight instructor. I give the film seven thumbs up. A slightly memorable film, and love does conquer all.

    All I need to say about this film, which sure impressed a lot of teen and twenties folk, is how ridiculous it is to see the flight deck of an aircraft carrier during a warlike confrontation, covered by cheering sailors who respond to the events as if they are watching them on a big screen . . . running a carrier is a minute-by-minute life threatening business, where the slightest inattention may result in grave injury if not death. "Maverick" would have been axed the first time he blatantly risked his aircraft, crew, and shipmates. I realize part of cinema is suspending disbelief to some extent, but other than some nice cinematography, this movie fails on so many levels.

    Top Gun (1986) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Blockbuster about hot shot pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) who gets a chance to show his stuff against the best Navy pilots in the world but soon his ways are challenged by another flier (Val Kilmer) who thinks he's too dangerous to be trusted. TOP GUN contains many flaws but at the same time there's no way you can deny the fact that it's rather entertaining, features a terrific cast and of course it turned Cruise into a major Hollywood star. We'll start with the negative stuff first. The biggest problem is without question the screenplay, which is just way too predictable for its own good. I mean, there are several twists in the story but there's not a single scene that you won't see coming from a mile away. We're introduced to a hot shot, we learn about his sad past, we see him fall for a strong woman (Kelly McGillis), we see him lose strong woman, we see a tragedy, we see him give up and of course we haven't even gotten to the predictable ending. I'm not saying the story had to be something hard-hitting or ground-breaking but there's no question that something not so predictable would have been good. As for the good stuff, you certainly can't overlook the terrific action scenes that are perfectly directed by Tony Scott. The director really makes you feel as if you're on board one of these jets and there's no question that there's some tense action throughout. Another major plus is that the cast is simply terrific as there are so many future stars here. Cruise, as you'd expect, has no problem playing the hot shot who soon starts to question what everyone is saying about him. You also have Kilmer turning in a good supporting part, although you have to wonder if he really wanted to be doing this character. Anthony Edwards, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, Michael Ironside and Tom Skerritt add nice support as well. I thought McGillis wasn't the typical actress you'd find in a romance like this but there's no question that she's good in the part. The soundtrack is full of "B" summer hits that add a little camp value. TOP GUN certainly isn't a perfect film but at least it's entertaining and as I said, it's always fun see so many stars in early roles.

    Tom Cruise stars as a super-confident navy flier(Maverick) sent to the prestigious Top Gun program to become "the best of the best", along with friend Anthony Edwards(The Goose). Film details their ups and downs, trials and tribulations learning to control their arrogance and graduate from the program, with the help of their love interests(Kelly McGillis & Meg Ryan) High-octane adventure is pretty clich&eacute;d, but incredibly entertaining and energetic, with many rousing scenes, and spectacular aerial action and(at the time) state of the art aircraft. Romance with McGillis is not credible, but a small issue in such a fun movie, a guilty pleasure of sorts, though a blockbuster hit in 1986!

His partner in the air is played by Anthony Edwards. I remember watching Anthony in E.R. a lot and was shocked to be reminded that he was in Top Gun. But he did a great job. Other cast members are Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis, Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Tim Robbins, James Tolkan & Meg Ryan. The casting is great and they all work very well together. The action scenes in the air were very well done and there were some great fighting scenes. There was some funny moments in the film, sad moments and exhilarating moments. This film was very well put together and was an emotional ride. The film has a great soundtrack too some classic songs from the 80s which never gets old. Yes, some of the songs are super cheesy, but that is what makes this film a classic. There are so many great quotes that come out of this film. It is well known for the singing scene in the bar. Possibly the worst chat up line ever! I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a classic, but nowhere near as good as some of the other movies to come out of the 80s. My daughter liked it which was the whole point of watching it again. "I feel the need... The need for speed!"

    One word to describe this movie: Incredible Usually I enjoy most the movies that seem to have a high rating, and seem to agree with the mainstream opinions. It is not my choice to be like that, and I am very glad that there are a few movies that really show that I have my own opinions about cinema, this being the best of them. I have seen this movie very many times, and never get tired of it. I can't believe it only has 6.5, it is a near-to-perfect movie of its kind in my opinion. Tom Cruise is perfect for the role of Maverick. Literally. The cast is great, and so are the editing and directing. This has got to be the coolest movie I've ever seen, yet it also has such a great storyline. It has a place in my all-time top 10 movies, and is maybe the most nostalgic movie to me. The soundtrack is freaking incredible! It is impossible for me to listen to the Top Gun Anthem without smiling and feeling truly victorious. I mean, that song defines victory, just as this movie defines cool. The Anthem is an epic song and the best of the soundtrack, but I also love Highway to the Danger Zone, Take My Breath Away and Mighty Wings very much. The songs go perfectly together, and the beginning of the movie is maybe my favorite opening scene ever, much thanks to the soundtrack. This movie is very special to me, and I recommend it to anyone who seeks to simply enjoy a good movie and not be too critical about it.

    Top Gun is a 80s classic. The good. Interesting academy rivalry. Nice choice of music and score. Great footage of fighter planes. Beautiful San Diego photography. Funny scenes. The actors. Tom Cruise plays the hothead excellently. Val Kilmer as his ice cool competitor is just perfect. However, the best and smoothest work is done by Meg Ryan. On the other hand, Kelly McGillis is unfortunately performed poorly and wasn't given much to work with. The rest of the cast does a pretty solid job. I'll just mention the better ones: Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt, and Michael Ironside. We can also see a small cameo by Tim Robbins. The bad. Easy dialogs. Poor romance plot with lots of clich&eacute; and a weak female lead. A few continuity problems. Cockpit filming, lighting conditions mainly, doesn't correspond to fighter plane footage. The ugly. Very awkward stick handling that looks ridiculous. The result. A classic, mainly for those interested in seeing what really launched Cruise's career.

    "I feel the need, the need for speed!" Top Gun is without any doubt one of the iconic movies of the 80's and marked Tom Cruise's international stardom after Risky Business another successful picture. The late Tony Scott directed a brilliant film based on fighter pilots in the Navy who aspire to become the best of the best in this exciting action drama starring Tom as the charismatic Pete "Maverick" Mitchell and his love affair with his instructor Charlie Blackwood played by Kelly McGillis and let's not forget Tom Skerritt, Anthony Edwards and Meg Ryan who delivered unforgettable performances. The dogfighting scenes involving F-14A Tomcats are perfect and believable without today's visual effects, in addition to the movie's soundtrack with its great songs. Top Gun is a masterpiece movie for everybody.

    'Maverick' is a hotshot pilot for the navy, that is, when he's not riding his bike or playing volleyball at the beach. Tom Cruise as 'Mav' is claimed by some to be "bigger than life" while the rest of us see him as he really appears -- somebody's kid brother, the squirt you don't want tagging along when you go to the movies with your significant other. Exciting flying scenes, a charged-up soundtrack, and the most unbelievable plot ever (until '50 First Dates'), made this sailor tripe a hit at the box office. Thank God Val Kilmer is around to give the chicks in the audience a good-looking guy to stare at, because shrimpy Tom Cruise ain't it. Recommended for aviation buffs and fans of military comedies.

    Top Gun is a good movie for those 12 and up. Top Gun touches us on many levels. It touches our intellect level by showing how important school (classroom) is in learning to be a good fighter pilot. It touches our heart by the romance between Tom Cruise and Meg Ryan. It touches our need for adventure and competition with the air flights and competition between pilots. However, it is competition and adventure with a purpose, to give the knowledge to survive. Top gun may even be an inspiring film to get people to enroll in the US Military as fight pilots or support air staff. Top Gun is entertaining as well. I thought that Michael Ironside made a good flight instructor. I give the film seven thumbs up. A slightly memorable film, and love does conquer all.

    All I need to say about this film, which sure impressed a lot of teen and twenties folk, is how ridiculous it is to see the flight deck of an aircraft carrier during a warlike confrontation, covered by cheering sailors who respond to the events as if they are watching them on a big screen . . . running a carrier is a minute-by-minute life threatening business, where the slightest inattention may result in grave injury if not death. "Maverick" would have been axed the first time he blatantly risked his aircraft, crew, and shipmates. I realize part of cinema is suspending disbelief to some extent, but other than some nice cinematography, this movie fails on so many levels.

    Top Gun (1986) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Blockbuster about hot shot pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) who gets a chance to show his stuff against the best Navy pilots in the world but soon his ways are challenged by another flier (Val Kilmer) who thinks he's too dangerous to be trusted. TOP GUN contains many flaws but at the same time there's no way you can deny the fact that it's rather entertaining, features a terrific cast and of course it turned Cruise into a major Hollywood star. We'll start with the negative stuff first. The biggest problem is without question the screenplay, which is just way too predictable for its own good. I mean, there are several twists in the story but there's not a single scene that you won't see coming from a mile away. We're introduced to a hot shot, we learn about his sad past, we see him fall for a strong woman (Kelly McGillis), we see him lose strong woman, we see a tragedy, we see him give up and of course we haven't even gotten to the predictable ending. I'm not saying the story had to be something hard-hitting or ground-breaking but there's no question that something not so predictable would have been good. As for the good stuff, you certainly can't overlook the terrific action scenes that are perfectly directed by Tony Scott. The director really makes you feel as if you're on board one of these jets and there's no question that there's some tense action throughout. Another major plus is that the cast is simply terrific as there are so many future stars here. Cruise, as you'd expect, has no problem playing the hot shot who soon starts to question what everyone is saying about him. You also have Kilmer turning in a good supporting part, although you have to wonder if he really wanted to be doing this character. Anthony Edwards, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, Michael Ironside and Tom Skerritt add nice support as well. I thought McGillis wasn't the typical actress you'd find in a romance like this but there's no question that she's good in the part. The soundtrack is full of "B" summer hits that add a little camp value. TOP GUN certainly isn't a perfect film but at least it's entertaining and as I said, it's always fun see so many stars in early roles.

    Tom Cruise stars as a super-confident navy flier(Maverick) sent to the prestigious Top Gun program to become "the best of the best", along with friend Anthony Edwards(The Goose). Film details their ups and downs, trials and tribulations learning to control their arrogance and graduate from the program, with the help of their love interests(Kelly McGillis & Meg Ryan) High-octane adventure is pretty clich&eacute;d, but incredibly entertaining and energetic, with many rousing scenes, and spectacular aerial action and(at the time) state of the art aircraft. Romance with McGillis is not credible, but a small issue in such a fun movie, a guilty pleasure of sorts, though a blockbuster hit in 1986!

    I can't believe that people think this is cool! The music is mostly taken from the deepest deep of the sh*t-hole known as: the 80's, and even the theme song sucks, considering Harold Faltermeyer made "Axel F". It all begins with the credits, it's slow, I guess they wanted all the names in the beginning, since it's hard to even stay awake, and the title reveal is cheap, and laughable. The action scene in the beginning was generic, and the music made it even worse, it was so out of place. Everything is very cheezy, and the scene where they play beach volley ball is just pathetic, it's clearly to get views from women, it's like "80's Twilight". I watched this because my dad wanted to show me how bad it is, so this is all coming from someone who's not even 18, and still has better taste than you. The movie was mostly so f*cking bad, that it was FUNNY, so I guess it's still a bit entertaining, but considering what was intended, I give it: 2/10, f*cking terrible, I gave it some more time, and I'm changing it from 4 to 2, it SUCKS.

    TOP GUN Back to the 80s this is a classic movie. I have seen it quite a few times now, but I felt that I had to introduce my daughter to the classic now she has turned 12. The movie is about a group of fighter pilots who are the best in the world that are trained as the elite of the elite. I really like the film. It has great action scenes and an actual story. Unfortunately it is a love story. A love story between a student and one of the instructors. Tom Cruise is the main character. He is a reckless pilot who likes to mess around and joke about in the air, which gets him in trouble from time to time but he is one of the best. Tom did a good job, but he is a very good actor anyway so this is no surprise. This was one of his earlier roles and it is easy to see how he has had such a huge career after this.

It is not my choice to be like that, and I am very glad that there are a few movies that really show that I have my own opinions about cinema, this being the best of them. I have seen this movie very many times, and never get tired of it. I can't believe it only has 6.5, it is a near-to-perfect movie of its kind in my opinion. Tom Cruise is perfect for the role of Maverick. Literally. The cast is great, and so are the editing and directing. This has got to be the coolest movie I've ever seen, yet it also has such a great storyline. It has a place in my all-time top 10 movies, and is maybe the most nostalgic movie to me. The soundtrack is freaking incredible! It is impossible for me to listen to the Top Gun Anthem without smiling and feeling truly victorious. I mean, that song defines victory, just as this movie defines cool. The Anthem is an epic song and the best of the soundtrack, but I also love Highway to the Danger Zone, Take My Breath Away and Mighty Wings very much. The songs go perfectly together, and the beginning of the movie is maybe my favorite opening scene ever, much thanks to the soundtrack. This movie is very special to me, and I recommend it to anyone who seeks to simply enjoy a good movie and not be too critical about it.

    Top Gun is a 80s classic. The good. Interesting academy rivalry. Nice choice of music and score. Great footage of fighter planes. Beautiful San Diego photography. Funny scenes. The actors. Tom Cruise plays the hothead excellently. Val Kilmer as his ice cool competitor is just perfect. However, the best and smoothest work is done by Meg Ryan. On the other hand, Kelly McGillis is unfortunately performed poorly and wasn't given much to work with. The rest of the cast does a pretty solid job. I'll just mention the better ones: Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerritt, and Michael Ironside. We can also see a small cameo by Tim Robbins. The bad. Easy dialogs. Poor romance plot with lots of clich&eacute; and a weak female lead. A few continuity problems. Cockpit filming, lighting conditions mainly, doesn't correspond to fighter plane footage. The ugly. Very awkward stick handling that looks ridiculous. The result. A classic, mainly for those interested in seeing what really launched Cruise's career.

    "I feel the need, the need for speed!" Top Gun is without any doubt one of the iconic movies of the 80's and marked Tom Cruise's international stardom after Risky Business another successful picture. The late Tony Scott directed a brilliant film based on fighter pilots in the Navy who aspire to become the best of the best in this exciting action drama starring Tom as the charismatic Pete "Maverick" Mitchell and his love affair with his instructor Charlie Blackwood played by Kelly McGillis and let's not forget Tom Skerritt, Anthony Edwards and Meg Ryan who delivered unforgettable performances. The dogfighting scenes involving F-14A Tomcats are perfect and believable without today's visual effects, in addition to the movie's soundtrack with its great songs. Top Gun is a masterpiece movie for everybody.

    'Maverick' is a hotshot pilot for the navy, that is, when he's not riding his bike or playing volleyball at the beach. Tom Cruise as 'Mav' is claimed by some to be "bigger than life" while the rest of us see him as he really appears -- somebody's kid brother, the squirt you don't want tagging along when you go to the movies with your significant other. Exciting flying scenes, a charged-up soundtrack, and the most unbelievable plot ever (until '50 First Dates'), made this sailor tripe a hit at the box office. Thank God Val Kilmer is around to give the chicks in the audience a good-looking guy to stare at, because shrimpy Tom Cruise ain't it. Recommended for aviation buffs and fans of military comedies.

    Top Gun is a good movie for those 12 and up. Top Gun touches us on many levels. It touches our intellect level by showing how important school (classroom) is in learning to be a good fighter pilot. It touches our heart by the romance between Tom Cruise and Meg Ryan. It touches our need for adventure and competition with the air flights and competition between pilots. However, it is competition and adventure with a purpose, to give the knowledge to survive. Top gun may even be an inspiring film to get people to enroll in the US Military as fight pilots or support air staff. Top Gun is entertaining as well. I thought that Michael Ironside made a good flight instructor. I give the film seven thumbs up. A slightly memorable film, and love does conquer all.

    All I need to say about this film, which sure impressed a lot of teen and twenties folk, is how ridiculous it is to see the flight deck of an aircraft carrier during a warlike confrontation, covered by cheering sailors who respond to the events as if they are watching them on a big screen . . . running a carrier is a minute-by-minute life threatening business, where the slightest inattention may result in grave injury if not death. "Maverick" would have been axed the first time he blatantly risked his aircraft, crew, and shipmates. I realize part of cinema is suspending disbelief to some extent, but other than some nice cinematography, this movie fails on so many levels.

    Top Gun (1986) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Blockbuster about hot shot pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) who gets a chance to show his stuff against the best Navy pilots in the world but soon his ways are challenged by another flier (Val Kilmer) who thinks he's too dangerous to be trusted. TOP GUN contains many flaws but at the same time there's no way you can deny the fact that it's rather entertaining, features a terrific cast and of course it turned Cruise into a major Hollywood star. We'll start with the negative stuff first. The biggest problem is without question the screenplay, which is just way too predictable for its own good. I mean, there are several twists in the story but there's not a single scene that you won't see coming from a mile away. We're introduced to a hot shot, we learn about his sad past, we see him fall for a strong woman (Kelly McGillis), we see him lose strong woman, we see a tragedy, we see him give up and of course we haven't even gotten to the predictable ending. I'm not saying the story had to be something hard-hitting or ground-breaking but there's no question that something not so predictable would have been good. As for the good stuff, you certainly can't overlook the terrific action scenes that are perfectly directed by Tony Scott. The director really makes you feel as if you're on board one of these jets and there's no question that there's some tense action throughout. Another major plus is that the cast is simply terrific as there are so many future stars here. Cruise, as you'd expect, has no problem playing the hot shot who soon starts to question what everyone is saying about him. You also have Kilmer turning in a good supporting part, although you have to wonder if he really wanted to be doing this character. Anthony Edwards, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, Michael Ironside and Tom Skerritt add nice support as well. I thought McGillis wasn't the typical actress you'd find in a romance like this but there's no question that she's good in the part. The soundtrack is full of "B" summer hits that add a little camp value. TOP GUN certainly isn't a perfect film but at least it's entertaining and as I said, it's always fun see so many stars in early roles.

    Tom Cruise stars as a super-confident navy flier(Maverick) sent to the prestigious Top Gun program to become "the best of the best", along with friend Anthony Edwards(The Goose). Film details their ups and downs, trials and tribulations learning to control their arrogance and graduate from the program, with the help of their love interests(Kelly McGillis & Meg Ryan) High-octane adventure is pretty clich&eacute;d, but incredibly entertaining and energetic, with many rousing scenes, and spectacular aerial action and(at the time) state of the art aircraft. Romance with McGillis is not credible, but a small issue in such a fun movie, a guilty pleasure of sorts, though a blockbuster hit in 1986!

    I can't believe that people think this is cool! The music is mostly taken from the deepest deep of the sh*t-hole known as: the 80's, and even the theme song sucks, considering Harold Faltermeyer made "Axel F". It all begins with the credits, it's slow, I guess they wanted all the names in the beginning, since it's hard to even stay awake, and the title reveal is cheap, and laughable. The action scene in the beginning was generic, and the music made it even worse, it was so out of place. Everything is very cheezy, and the scene where they play beach volley ball is just pathetic, it's clearly to get views from women, it's like "80's Twilight". I watched this because my dad wanted to show me how bad it is, so this is all coming from someone who's not even 18, and still has better taste than you. The movie was mostly so f*cking bad, that it was FUNNY, so I guess it's still a bit entertaining, but considering what was intended, I give it: 2/10, f*cking terrible, I gave it some more time, and I'm changing it from 4 to 2, it SUCKS.

    TOP GUN Back to the 80s this is a classic movie. I have seen it quite a few times now, but I felt that I had to introduce my daughter to the classic now she has turned 12. The movie is about a group of fighter pilots who are the best in the world that are trained as the elite of the elite. I really like the film. It has great action scenes and an actual story. Unfortunately it is a love story. A love story between a student and one of the instructors. Tom Cruise is the main character. He is a reckless pilot who likes to mess around and joke about in the air, which gets him in trouble from time to time but he is one of the best. Tom did a good job, but he is a very good actor anyway so this is no surprise. This was one of his earlier roles and it is easy to see how he has had such a huge career after this. His partner in the air is played by Anthony Edwards. I remember watching Anthony in E.R. a lot and was shocked to be reminded that he was in Top Gun. But he did a great job. Other cast members are Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis, Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Tim Robbins, James Tolkan & Meg Ryan. The casting is great and they all work very well together. The action scenes in the air were very well done and there were some great fighting scenes. There was some funny moments in the film, sad moments and exhilarating moments. This film was very well put together and was an emotional ride. The film has a great soundtrack too some classic songs from the 80s which never gets old. Yes, some of the songs are super cheesy, but that is what makes this film a classic. There are so many great quotes that come out of this film. It is well known for the singing scene in the bar. Possibly the worst chat up line ever! I will give this film 7 out of 10. It is a classic, but nowhere near as good as some of the other movies to come out of the 80s. My daughter liked it which was the whole point of watching it again. "I feel the need... The need for speed!"
