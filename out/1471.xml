    One night, while driving home with his wife and daughter, Hatch (Jeff Goldblum) gets into a car accident which results in his temporary death. Enter Dr. Nyebern, who has developed a unique resuscitation technique that can revive the dead even after a prolonged period of time. After his revival, Hatch begins having visions of young girls being murdered. It turns out that he shares some sort of special link with the deranged killer (Jeremy Sisto), as they have both been to the other side. Unable to convince anyone of his warnings and knowledge, it's only up to Hatch to stop the killer, who may have a target in mind close to Hatch's heart. This film wasn't particularly exciting, scary or suspenseful. In fact, I scoffed at it from time to time. It was quite ridiculous, cheap, trashy, conventional, predictable, and laughable. The special effects were subpar and murky. The best and most inspired scene was during the first five minutes when the killer journeyed in agony towards hell, after committing an atrocious act and then committing suicide. At least that was something I had not seen too often before. The rest of the movie was merely another slasher film in disguise, no matter how high-gloss it seemed. By the end of the film, many questions and plot holes had arisen but were not addressed. Also, the science, law, and technicalities (e.g. maintaining a patient's confidentiality despite being a menace to others) brought up in the film were terribly erroneous. Much of the film was in bad taste. From time to time, the filmmakers treaded on thin ice by depicting questionable, unsavory, and objectionable acts and images. I also thought the film was going to make some point about spirituality, religion, hell, or heaven, but no such luck. Though some characters were not written well or underutilized of their full potentials, the acting was fine, especially Jeremy Sisto's risky performance as the despicable creep. However, I simply did not care for Goldblum's character and was not convinced of his suffering. Some of his actions, reactions, and dialogues were wayward and awkward. Sometimes he made mistakes when he should have known better and was slow to catch on with certain matters. His wife's role (Christine Lahti) was mostly limited and reduced to that of the long-suffering spouse. She was there mostly to lend support when needed, only becoming a more independent and stronger character near the end. Alicia Silverstone's daughter character was limited in scope as well; mainly serving as a plot gimmick for the killer to prey on. There are far better and scarier horror films out there, Hideaway is not one of them. One film that comes to mind is Lord of Illusions, which is more grotesque, violent, gory, and over-the-top, but effective nonetheless. It goes all the way with its unique, nightmarish, and sensational imagery, and knows no boundaries. Unlike Hideaway, it establishes no pretensions of the divine and evil, and engages us with interesting characters whom we care about.

    Hatch Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) seems to be connected with the mind of a murderer after a fatal car accident kills him (he gets better as doctors bring him back to the land of the living after around 2 hours of being not on this mortal coil. The thing is that while he was deceased so was a serial killer whom also gets revived at around the same time. Now suffering from terrifying visions, he has to solve this mystery before the killer strikes someone close to him (namely his daughter played by Alicia Silverstone) even as everyone thinks he's crazy. When anyone claims that "Batman and Robin" contained the worst acting by Silverstone, I point them to this sorry little flick which she is atrocious in.

    Let me begin with saying, that the movie really isn't that bad. Just make sure you haven't read the book before. If you have, don't watch the movie. Key elements from the plot of the book is either left out completely, or altered so drastically that it has significant negative effect on both the story and for certain characters, the character development throughout the plot. Actually, this is the 3rd Koontz adaptation I've seen in recent history, and I actually thought it couldn't get any worse than "Watchers", but this one is. So far, the least worst movie adaptation I've seen, is "Mr. Murder". So my recommendation, if your going to rent a Koontz movie, is to avoid this one. Read the book instead. It will take more time but will definitely be worth it.

    I have to admit, I watched 'Hideaway' because I had quite high expectations of Jeremy Sisto playing the evil guy. And it has to be said, he is fun watching in his role of Vassago. His angelic looks combined with being a 'very bad boy' is an enjoyable combination (especially when he is taking a shower ;-) ). But enough praises for being sexy. Goldblum's performance is also fine. I was less convinced though about Lindsey Harrison, but it might also be that the plot just wasn't really on her hands. The dialogs were often pretty unconvincing and annoying. But the worst part of the movie was the incredibly cheesy end. As soon as the battle between good and bad started, my jaw dropped and I could only laugh. It wasn't all that good till that point, but the end really ruined everything that was still left of the movie. It's not that we are talking about the ineffectiveness of the still young era of computer effects, it was just.. all... just..... yes, terribly, terribly cheesy. If the script would have been better worked out, with better dialogs and a better pace, I might have given it a 6 or 7. But without that dialog and a better pace, and with an ending like this, I can not come up with more then a 4.

    Hatch, his wife Lindsey and their daughter Regina are in a car accident one night, which sees Hatch supposedly die to only be brought back to life on the operating table by Dr. Jonas Nyebern after being dead for a short period . After this miracle he begins having odd flashes / visions that he has trouble dealing with as they seem so real, as Dr. Nyebern seems to be hiding something about his work. Hatch would discover later that he actually has a special connection with a vicious psychopathic serial killer that can see through his eyes and he can see through theirs. Is there a special link to this, or is Hatch loosing his mind? A respectable, but stock-like psychic thriller adapted from a Dean R. Koontz novelisation, which bestows a capable bunch of actors in the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Christine Lahti, Alicia Silverstone (a wholesome turn before making herself big in "Clueless"), Jeremy Sisto and Alfred Molina. Director Brett Leonard (from the "The Dead Pit") brings to the feature the computer special effects that shrouded his previous sci-fi film "The Lawnmower Man", but for "Hideaway" it's only used in minor doses in the sequences involving the afterlife / out of body experiences. Although it lets loose towards the film's rampaging, if overdone climax in a good vs. evil confrontation of souls in illuminating lights, but the computer effects for its period are well done for most part. Nevertheless it's compellingly delivered, even though it consists of some clumpy dialogues and holds quite a stringy plot that has you questioning details for them to only unfold the further it went. When it decided to feed us some of the niggling queries (it opens up a can of worms) to clear up any confusion and this is when it suddenly turned mechanical and unassuming in its plot progression. Gone was the hauntingly edgy and sombre atmospherics of looming nightmares of a character trying to make sense of the erratically jarring images plaguing his mind. Was he unknowingly committing these acts in some sort of blackout or was he tunnelling somebody else's sight? Now it would be replaced with the standard over-the-top race against the clock with the family in peril get-up. This type of story has been done plenty of times before, but Goldblum's sober turn is an interesting one and Leonard's sickly crafted, well paced direction is visually appealing in its dourly under lit, but well filtered tones and glassily etched-out suspense. Gale Tattersall's expressive photography is lean, but precise. Sisto's homicidal serial killer performance at first is sinisterly creepy, but as it went along it began to grate away with his eccentricity opting out. Trevor Jones' music score is hauntingly harmonious in its arrangement and the Gothic / industrial rock soundtrack is fitting. Also after the credits finish rolling there's an unnecessary tacked on shock sequence with "Carrie" getting a reference.

    Yes, Jurassic Park used computer generated images very well. However, they had a big budget and were able to make those dinosaurs look very realistic. This one ended up making very bad images of hell and of weird crap that looked as if it were not there. Jeff Goldblum was in both, coincidence? Yes, but still he was in one of the best examples of early computer images and one of the worst. What makes it more terrible is that a lot of horror movies began doing it, and to this day the monsters in these movies still look like they are not there. So the story in this one has two guys dying and being revived by similar means. One a family guy with a daughter, the other guy...well lets just say he is not so good. The guy who is not so good has a secret about his death, he is also a killer. The other guy (Goldblum) seems to have a link to this killer because of the way they were both revived. Near the end the killer targets the teen daughter and the father must try to pry her from this seemingly evil guy's clutches. Just did not really work for me, and apparently not to Dean Koontz either as I hear he did not like this movie at all. It has a somewhat good cast for a horror movie as along with Goldblum you have Alicia Silverstone and Alfred Molino, but one just can not get the lame effects out of one's head.

    Not long after losing one of his two daughters in a car accident, family man and antique store owner Jeff Goldblum suffers his own car trauma and literally dies momentarily; a doctor brings him back to life, but it seems Goldblum has brought good and evil powers back with him from the other side: he is now telepathically entwined with a psychopath who hunts young women. Based on a Dean Koontz novel, this low-grade thriller has one of the laziest screenplays I've ever come across. Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and Neal Jimenez don't seem to have a shred of verisimilitude when it comes to writing dialogue for their equally unreal characters--nobody behaves the way regular people would. Christine Lahti is Goldblum's ineffective wife, Alfred Molina is Goldblum's ineffective doctor, Kenneth Welsh is an ineffective detective. They're all walking contrivances in this half-cocked adaptation, which allegedly embarrassed best-selling author Koontz (if it didn't, it should have). Just back from the hospital, Goldblum begins having nightmares that look like bits and pieces of a heavy metal video; the viewer is cued up for the obligatory waking-up-with-a-jolt-from-a-nightmare close-up (and the movie doesn't disappoint). Turns out there's a killer in town (Jeremy Sisto) who gets around from place to place with effortless, alarming accuracy; when he's not hanging out at a sleazy motel--which isn't even listed with information--he's holed up at a derelict amusement park (seems he conveniently has the place all to himself). Of course, nobody takes note that Sisto's latest victim looks like Goldblum's other daughter (Alicia Silverstone, who does nothing but whine), nor does wife Lahti take into account that just maybe her husband knows what he's talking about when he says their kid is in danger. The movie makes absolutely no sense from a logical stand-point, though all of this is rendered inconsequential once Jeff and Christine arrive for a showdown with Sisto near the park's Big Slide ride. The results of this stillborn finale are so shameful, one can only hope Goldblum and company were well-paid for not looking outraged. NO STARS from ****

    "Hideaway" really wasn't as bad as it could've been, but it's not all that great as it is. **SPOILERS** Coming home from their ski-top resort, Hatch, (Jeff Goldblum) and Lindsey Harrison, (Christine Lahti) and his troubled daughter Regina, (Alicia Silverstone) are involved in a horrific car accident, and Hatch is brought back from the dead afterwards. After being normal for a few days, he begins to have weird nightmares and visions, and Dr. Jonas Nybern, (Alfred Molina) confirms it's nothing. Despite the reassurance, he still has the visions of a strange man attacking people, all done with his mind. Eventually learning that the man is named Jeremy, (Jeremy Sisto) and that he had been brought back to life Hatch's recovery from the accident after himself dying. As he begins a city-wide rampage that includes Regina in his targets, Hatch races to stop him before he can fully return from the dark side. The Good News: This wasn't all that bad of a film and did contain some nice moments. The fact that the film does use a fairly routine and clich&eacute;d storyline into something actually decent. The fact that an ordinary man is in contact with a demonic entity is done before and done quite well, but this is still a very watchable film. They use the technique well and make it a very worthwhile watch. That also has an added bonus in being able to give the film a large amount of suspense through this, and it does have a creepy tone throughout. The visions are thankfully not just of the killer going about his business killing the innocents, but also the set-ups and seemingly random scenes that will eventually be useful later on in the chase. That is a nice touch and is really welcomed. The ending chase is it's best part, full of suspense and some nice action. The reasoning behind the battle is the majority of the suspense, as the longer it takes to get to the final showdown is less time needed to save one of the victims and the journey to get there through a never-ending series of darkened tunnels also chipping in some as well. The final battle, with the turns in the tide of the fight and the setting placed provide some really nice action scenes that effectively end the movie on a high note. The early scenes in the nightclubs do have an eerie quality to them, and are nicely placed to keep it from being a really drawn-process. The car crash at the beginning, while being slightly overkill, is also one of the best scenes, being a really high-action set-piece that is quite thrilling and is a real spectacle. The pace isn't that terrible, and while it could've shortened some scenes there's really nothing that keeps it from being an overlong film. This really could've been far worse. The Bad News: There isn't a lot here that keeps it from being that great. As mentioned before, the pace isn't that great, and there are some scenes that drag out far longer than possible. The opening car crash is a major example. Once the car hits the woods, the scene could've ended there and still had the set-up necessary for the rest of the movie. There's no reason to drag it out far longer than it is. The many scenes of wandering around listening to the characters attempt to explain what's going on near the end are some other big scenes. That also brings up the other big factor, which is the stupidity of the characters. Major plot points are not revealed by any intelligence on the characters' part, but based on coincidence. The best is the discovery of the motel the killer is staying at. The character happens to drive by it, even though it's been seen through his visions countless time before it and that takes it sheer coincidence that it happened. The CGI at the end is really unrealistic and only just looks fake now as it did then. With a little help, this could've been a lot better. The Final Verdict: There could've been some little fixing to make this a little better, but it's still not that bad as it is. It's not really the worst film of this type, but there is still room for improvement. Give it a shot if it sounds interesting, just don't expect a classic and it'll be a decent watch. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity

    ***Spoilers may be contained within*** According to this movie's "trivia" section, the book's author, Dean R Koontz, was sorely disappointed in the movie adaptation and asked that his name be removed. He had every right to be peeved. I saw this in theatres when it was released and was soundly disappointed, too. The previews seemed kind of interesting but I have to admit I'm a Christine Lahti fan, even though her role in this is strictly "the wife". The story is that of a man, played by Jeff Goldblum, who, following a near-death experience, finds he is psychically linked with a serial killer, played by Jeremy Sisto, who decides to go after Goldblum's daughter (Alicia Silverstone). A cat-and-mouse thriller with sci-fi overtones. I've never read the Koontz book on which this is based. Goodness knows it can't be any worse. As lead, Goldblum is OK, I guess, though he's given this basic performance before. Lahti, unfortunately, is wasted in a part that could be played by just about ANY actress; it's a step up from "and how was YOUR day, dear?" but not much. Silverstone, charming in "Clueless", here is little more than an irritant, nearly making one rather root for the killer, but she can often be irritating in films, so I can't say if it's the fault of the part as written or the actress. As said villain, Jeremy Sisto has obviously watched every other psycho-on-the-loose movie and decided to "juice it up" a bit: he rolls his eyes, leers, laughs "maniacally", tries to seem intimidating by staring through lowered eyes. Every trick in the book is trotted out in his performance and for naught: he's about as terrifying as a computer geek. Sisto can, in other performances, be hammy, and he's no less so here: one nearly expects to see him studded with cloves and pineapple slices. Oh, it's not TOTALLY his fault, since the pedestrian script practically BEGS for overacting; I suppose if he DIDN'T chew the scenery, it might actually be less entertaining than it already IS. Beyond its psychic-link tricks, the film, in its less-than-chilling climax, throws in, seemingly out of nowhere, the twist that this is almost literally a battle between (of course) good and evil. This is revealed with a scene when Goldblum and Sisto are finally staring one another down, and a shot of red flames are visible in Sisto's eye; suddenly, in response, we see a flash of white-blue light in Goldblum's eye. A moment later, flames shoot and rise from Sisto's body, forming a fireball above him; blue-white rays of light pour forth from a kneeling Goldblum, forming a vaguely female form above him. The combination of film-school "special" effects (if they look cheesy on the SMALL screen, you can't IMAGINE how bad they were in the theatre!), this last-minute twist, and the inability to stretch one's suspension of disbelief any longer, is fatal. I heard several voices in the audience yell out, in unison, "Oh, COME ON!" From some of the reviews listed here, this movie has a fair number of supporters. I can only wonder just what version of this movie they saw.

    While traveling on the road with his wife Lindsay (Christine Lahti) and his daughter Regina (Alicia Silverstone), Hatch Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) has a car accident, hitting a truck and falling with his wife in a river. He dies for more than two hours, but the specialist Dr. Jonas Nyebern (Alfred Molina) successfully brings him back to life. Hatch has some weird premonitions and becomes able to see through the eyes of the psychopath serial killer Vassago (Jeremy Sisto), a young man that killed his mother and his sister and committed suicide and was also brought back to life and now is killing young women and teenagers. When he foresees that Vassago is trying to capture his daughter, Hatch tries to find the criminal first, in spite of Lindsay, Regina and the detective in charge of the investigation believe that he needs psychiatric help. "Hideaway" is another rip-off of "Eye of Laura Mars", I believe the first movie to explore the idea of a person connected to a serial killer through his eyes. "Hideaway" has a good cinematography and special affects, the cast is great and the sequence of the accident of Hatch and Lindsay is excellent. Although not being an original storyline, this attractive movie entertains. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "O Esconderijo" ("The Hiding Place")

It wasn't all that good till that point, but the end really ruined everything that was still left of the movie. It's not that we are talking about the ineffectiveness of the still young era of computer effects, it was just.. all... just..... yes, terribly, terribly cheesy. If the script would have been better worked out, with better dialogs and a better pace, I might have given it a 6 or 7. But without that dialog and a better pace, and with an ending like this, I can not come up with more then a 4.

    Hatch, his wife Lindsey and their daughter Regina are in a car accident one night, which sees Hatch supposedly die to only be brought back to life on the operating table by Dr. Jonas Nyebern after being dead for a short period . After this miracle he begins having odd flashes / visions that he has trouble dealing with as they seem so real, as Dr. Nyebern seems to be hiding something about his work. Hatch would discover later that he actually has a special connection with a vicious psychopathic serial killer that can see through his eyes and he can see through theirs. Is there a special link to this, or is Hatch loosing his mind? A respectable, but stock-like psychic thriller adapted from a Dean R. Koontz novelisation, which bestows a capable bunch of actors in the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Christine Lahti, Alicia Silverstone (a wholesome turn before making herself big in "Clueless"), Jeremy Sisto and Alfred Molina. Director Brett Leonard (from the "The Dead Pit") brings to the feature the computer special effects that shrouded his previous sci-fi film "The Lawnmower Man", but for "Hideaway" it's only used in minor doses in the sequences involving the afterlife / out of body experiences. Although it lets loose towards the film's rampaging, if overdone climax in a good vs. evil confrontation of souls in illuminating lights, but the computer effects for its period are well done for most part. Nevertheless it's compellingly delivered, even though it consists of some clumpy dialogues and holds quite a stringy plot that has you questioning details for them to only unfold the further it went. When it decided to feed us some of the niggling queries (it opens up a can of worms) to clear up any confusion and this is when it suddenly turned mechanical and unassuming in its plot progression. Gone was the hauntingly edgy and sombre atmospherics of looming nightmares of a character trying to make sense of the erratically jarring images plaguing his mind. Was he unknowingly committing these acts in some sort of blackout or was he tunnelling somebody else's sight? Now it would be replaced with the standard over-the-top race against the clock with the family in peril get-up. This type of story has been done plenty of times before, but Goldblum's sober turn is an interesting one and Leonard's sickly crafted, well paced direction is visually appealing in its dourly under lit, but well filtered tones and glassily etched-out suspense. Gale Tattersall's expressive photography is lean, but precise. Sisto's homicidal serial killer performance at first is sinisterly creepy, but as it went along it began to grate away with his eccentricity opting out. Trevor Jones' music score is hauntingly harmonious in its arrangement and the Gothic / industrial rock soundtrack is fitting. Also after the credits finish rolling there's an unnecessary tacked on shock sequence with "Carrie" getting a reference.

    Yes, Jurassic Park used computer generated images very well. However, they had a big budget and were able to make those dinosaurs look very realistic. This one ended up making very bad images of hell and of weird crap that looked as if it were not there. Jeff Goldblum was in both, coincidence? Yes, but still he was in one of the best examples of early computer images and one of the worst. What makes it more terrible is that a lot of horror movies began doing it, and to this day the monsters in these movies still look like they are not there. So the story in this one has two guys dying and being revived by similar means. One a family guy with a daughter, the other guy...well lets just say he is not so good. The guy who is not so good has a secret about his death, he is also a killer. The other guy (Goldblum) seems to have a link to this killer because of the way they were both revived. Near the end the killer targets the teen daughter and the father must try to pry her from this seemingly evil guy's clutches. Just did not really work for me, and apparently not to Dean Koontz either as I hear he did not like this movie at all. It has a somewhat good cast for a horror movie as along with Goldblum you have Alicia Silverstone and Alfred Molino, but one just can not get the lame effects out of one's head.

    Not long after losing one of his two daughters in a car accident, family man and antique store owner Jeff Goldblum suffers his own car trauma and literally dies momentarily; a doctor brings him back to life, but it seems Goldblum has brought good and evil powers back with him from the other side: he is now telepathically entwined with a psychopath who hunts young women. Based on a Dean Koontz novel, this low-grade thriller has one of the laziest screenplays I've ever come across. Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and Neal Jimenez don't seem to have a shred of verisimilitude when it comes to writing dialogue for their equally unreal characters--nobody behaves the way regular people would. Christine Lahti is Goldblum's ineffective wife, Alfred Molina is Goldblum's ineffective doctor, Kenneth Welsh is an ineffective detective. They're all walking contrivances in this half-cocked adaptation, which allegedly embarrassed best-selling author Koontz (if it didn't, it should have). Just back from the hospital, Goldblum begins having nightmares that look like bits and pieces of a heavy metal video; the viewer is cued up for the obligatory waking-up-with-a-jolt-from-a-nightmare close-up (and the movie doesn't disappoint). Turns out there's a killer in town (Jeremy Sisto) who gets around from place to place with effortless, alarming accuracy; when he's not hanging out at a sleazy motel--which isn't even listed with information--he's holed up at a derelict amusement park (seems he conveniently has the place all to himself). Of course, nobody takes note that Sisto's latest victim looks like Goldblum's other daughter (Alicia Silverstone, who does nothing but whine), nor does wife Lahti take into account that just maybe her husband knows what he's talking about when he says their kid is in danger. The movie makes absolutely no sense from a logical stand-point, though all of this is rendered inconsequential once Jeff and Christine arrive for a showdown with Sisto near the park's Big Slide ride. The results of this stillborn finale are so shameful, one can only hope Goldblum and company were well-paid for not looking outraged. NO STARS from ****

    "Hideaway" really wasn't as bad as it could've been, but it's not all that great as it is. **SPOILERS** Coming home from their ski-top resort, Hatch, (Jeff Goldblum) and Lindsey Harrison, (Christine Lahti) and his troubled daughter Regina, (Alicia Silverstone) are involved in a horrific car accident, and Hatch is brought back from the dead afterwards. After being normal for a few days, he begins to have weird nightmares and visions, and Dr. Jonas Nybern, (Alfred Molina) confirms it's nothing. Despite the reassurance, he still has the visions of a strange man attacking people, all done with his mind. Eventually learning that the man is named Jeremy, (Jeremy Sisto) and that he had been brought back to life Hatch's recovery from the accident after himself dying. As he begins a city-wide rampage that includes Regina in his targets, Hatch races to stop him before he can fully return from the dark side. The Good News: This wasn't all that bad of a film and did contain some nice moments. The fact that the film does use a fairly routine and clich&eacute;d storyline into something actually decent. The fact that an ordinary man is in contact with a demonic entity is done before and done quite well, but this is still a very watchable film. They use the technique well and make it a very worthwhile watch. That also has an added bonus in being able to give the film a large amount of suspense through this, and it does have a creepy tone throughout. The visions are thankfully not just of the killer going about his business killing the innocents, but also the set-ups and seemingly random scenes that will eventually be useful later on in the chase. That is a nice touch and is really welcomed. The ending chase is it's best part, full of suspense and some nice action. The reasoning behind the battle is the majority of the suspense, as the longer it takes to get to the final showdown is less time needed to save one of the victims and the journey to get there through a never-ending series of darkened tunnels also chipping in some as well. The final battle, with the turns in the tide of the fight and the setting placed provide some really nice action scenes that effectively end the movie on a high note. The early scenes in the nightclubs do have an eerie quality to them, and are nicely placed to keep it from being a really drawn-process. The car crash at the beginning, while being slightly overkill, is also one of the best scenes, being a really high-action set-piece that is quite thrilling and is a real spectacle. The pace isn't that terrible, and while it could've shortened some scenes there's really nothing that keeps it from being an overlong film. This really could've been far worse. The Bad News: There isn't a lot here that keeps it from being that great. As mentioned before, the pace isn't that great, and there are some scenes that drag out far longer than possible. The opening car crash is a major example. Once the car hits the woods, the scene could've ended there and still had the set-up necessary for the rest of the movie. There's no reason to drag it out far longer than it is. The many scenes of wandering around listening to the characters attempt to explain what's going on near the end are some other big scenes. That also brings up the other big factor, which is the stupidity of the characters. Major plot points are not revealed by any intelligence on the characters' part, but based on coincidence. The best is the discovery of the motel the killer is staying at. The character happens to drive by it, even though it's been seen through his visions countless time before it and that takes it sheer coincidence that it happened. The CGI at the end is really unrealistic and only just looks fake now as it did then. With a little help, this could've been a lot better. The Final Verdict: There could've been some little fixing to make this a little better, but it's still not that bad as it is. It's not really the worst film of this type, but there is still room for improvement. Give it a shot if it sounds interesting, just don't expect a classic and it'll be a decent watch. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity

    ***Spoilers may be contained within*** According to this movie's "trivia" section, the book's author, Dean R Koontz, was sorely disappointed in the movie adaptation and asked that his name be removed. He had every right to be peeved. I saw this in theatres when it was released and was soundly disappointed, too. The previews seemed kind of interesting but I have to admit I'm a Christine Lahti fan, even though her role in this is strictly "the wife". The story is that of a man, played by Jeff Goldblum, who, following a near-death experience, finds he is psychically linked with a serial killer, played by Jeremy Sisto, who decides to go after Goldblum's daughter (Alicia Silverstone). A cat-and-mouse thriller with sci-fi overtones. I've never read the Koontz book on which this is based. Goodness knows it can't be any worse. As lead, Goldblum is OK, I guess, though he's given this basic performance before. Lahti, unfortunately, is wasted in a part that could be played by just about ANY actress; it's a step up from "and how was YOUR day, dear?" but not much. Silverstone, charming in "Clueless", here is little more than an irritant, nearly making one rather root for the killer, but she can often be irritating in films, so I can't say if it's the fault of the part as written or the actress. As said villain, Jeremy Sisto has obviously watched every other psycho-on-the-loose movie and decided to "juice it up" a bit: he rolls his eyes, leers, laughs "maniacally", tries to seem intimidating by staring through lowered eyes. Every trick in the book is trotted out in his performance and for naught: he's about as terrifying as a computer geek. Sisto can, in other performances, be hammy, and he's no less so here: one nearly expects to see him studded with cloves and pineapple slices. Oh, it's not TOTALLY his fault, since the pedestrian script practically BEGS for overacting; I suppose if he DIDN'T chew the scenery, it might actually be less entertaining than it already IS. Beyond its psychic-link tricks, the film, in its less-than-chilling climax, throws in, seemingly out of nowhere, the twist that this is almost literally a battle between (of course) good and evil. This is revealed with a scene when Goldblum and Sisto are finally staring one another down, and a shot of red flames are visible in Sisto's eye; suddenly, in response, we see a flash of white-blue light in Goldblum's eye. A moment later, flames shoot and rise from Sisto's body, forming a fireball above him; blue-white rays of light pour forth from a kneeling Goldblum, forming a vaguely female form above him. The combination of film-school "special" effects (if they look cheesy on the SMALL screen, you can't IMAGINE how bad they were in the theatre!), this last-minute twist, and the inability to stretch one's suspension of disbelief any longer, is fatal. I heard several voices in the audience yell out, in unison, "Oh, COME ON!" From some of the reviews listed here, this movie has a fair number of supporters. I can only wonder just what version of this movie they saw.

    While traveling on the road with his wife Lindsay (Christine Lahti) and his daughter Regina (Alicia Silverstone), Hatch Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) has a car accident, hitting a truck and falling with his wife in a river. He dies for more than two hours, but the specialist Dr. Jonas Nyebern (Alfred Molina) successfully brings him back to life. Hatch has some weird premonitions and becomes able to see through the eyes of the psychopath serial killer Vassago (Jeremy Sisto), a young man that killed his mother and his sister and committed suicide and was also brought back to life and now is killing young women and teenagers. When he foresees that Vassago is trying to capture his daughter, Hatch tries to find the criminal first, in spite of Lindsay, Regina and the detective in charge of the investigation believe that he needs psychiatric help. "Hideaway" is another rip-off of "Eye of Laura Mars", I believe the first movie to explore the idea of a person connected to a serial killer through his eyes. "Hideaway" has a good cinematography and special affects, the cast is great and the sequence of the accident of Hatch and Lindsay is excellent. Although not being an original storyline, this attractive movie entertains. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "O Esconderijo" ("The Hiding Place")

    One night, while driving home with his wife and daughter, Hatch (Jeff Goldblum) gets into a car accident which results in his temporary death. Enter Dr. Nyebern, who has developed a unique resuscitation technique that can revive the dead even after a prolonged period of time. After his revival, Hatch begins having visions of young girls being murdered. It turns out that he shares some sort of special link with the deranged killer (Jeremy Sisto), as they have both been to the other side. Unable to convince anyone of his warnings and knowledge, it's only up to Hatch to stop the killer, who may have a target in mind close to Hatch's heart. This film wasn't particularly exciting, scary or suspenseful. In fact, I scoffed at it from time to time. It was quite ridiculous, cheap, trashy, conventional, predictable, and laughable. The special effects were subpar and murky. The best and most inspired scene was during the first five minutes when the killer journeyed in agony towards hell, after committing an atrocious act and then committing suicide. At least that was something I had not seen too often before. The rest of the movie was merely another slasher film in disguise, no matter how high-gloss it seemed. By the end of the film, many questions and plot holes had arisen but were not addressed. Also, the science, law, and technicalities (e.g. maintaining a patient's confidentiality despite being a menace to others) brought up in the film were terribly erroneous. Much of the film was in bad taste. From time to time, the filmmakers treaded on thin ice by depicting questionable, unsavory, and objectionable acts and images. I also thought the film was going to make some point about spirituality, religion, hell, or heaven, but no such luck. Though some characters were not written well or underutilized of their full potentials, the acting was fine, especially Jeremy Sisto's risky performance as the despicable creep. However, I simply did not care for Goldblum's character and was not convinced of his suffering. Some of his actions, reactions, and dialogues were wayward and awkward. Sometimes he made mistakes when he should have known better and was slow to catch on with certain matters. His wife's role (Christine Lahti) was mostly limited and reduced to that of the long-suffering spouse. She was there mostly to lend support when needed, only becoming a more independent and stronger character near the end. Alicia Silverstone's daughter character was limited in scope as well; mainly serving as a plot gimmick for the killer to prey on. There are far better and scarier horror films out there, Hideaway is not one of them. One film that comes to mind is Lord of Illusions, which is more grotesque, violent, gory, and over-the-top, but effective nonetheless. It goes all the way with its unique, nightmarish, and sensational imagery, and knows no boundaries. Unlike Hideaway, it establishes no pretensions of the divine and evil, and engages us with interesting characters whom we care about.

    Hatch Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) seems to be connected with the mind of a murderer after a fatal car accident kills him (he gets better as doctors bring him back to the land of the living after around 2 hours of being not on this mortal coil. The thing is that while he was deceased so was a serial killer whom also gets revived at around the same time. Now suffering from terrifying visions, he has to solve this mystery before the killer strikes someone close to him (namely his daughter played by Alicia Silverstone) even as everyone thinks he's crazy. When anyone claims that "Batman and Robin" contained the worst acting by Silverstone, I point them to this sorry little flick which she is atrocious in. However that's somehow fitting as this film is uniformly bad in most other aspects as well. Poor Dean Koontz it seems like none of his books will ever translate that well to feature films (and don't even get me started on those "Watcher" films... My Grade: D

    Let me begin with saying, that the movie really isn't that bad. Just make sure you haven't read the book before. If you have, don't watch the movie. Key elements from the plot of the book is either left out completely, or altered so drastically that it has significant negative effect on both the story and for certain characters, the character development throughout the plot. Actually, this is the 3rd Koontz adaptation I've seen in recent history, and I actually thought it couldn't get any worse than "Watchers", but this one is. So far, the least worst movie adaptation I've seen, is "Mr. Murder". So my recommendation, if your going to rent a Koontz movie, is to avoid this one. Read the book instead. It will take more time but will definitely be worth it.

    I have to admit, I watched 'Hideaway' because I had quite high expectations of Jeremy Sisto playing the evil guy. And it has to be said, he is fun watching in his role of Vassago. His angelic looks combined with being a 'very bad boy' is an enjoyable combination (especially when he is taking a shower ;-) ). But enough praises for being sexy. Goldblum's performance is also fine. I was less convinced though about Lindsey Harrison, but it might also be that the plot just wasn't really on her hands. The dialogs were often pretty unconvincing and annoying. But the worst part of the movie was the incredibly cheesy end. As soon as the battle between good and bad started, my jaw dropped and I could only laugh. It wasn't all that good till that point, but the end really ruined everything that was still left of the movie.

As he begins a city-wide rampage that includes Regina in his targets, Hatch races to stop him before he can fully return from the dark side. The Good News: This wasn't all that bad of a film and did contain some nice moments. The fact that the film does use a fairly routine and clich&eacute;d storyline into something actually decent. The fact that an ordinary man is in contact with a demonic entity is done before and done quite well, but this is still a very watchable film. They use the technique well and make it a very worthwhile watch. That also has an added bonus in being able to give the film a large amount of suspense through this, and it does have a creepy tone throughout. The visions are thankfully not just of the killer going about his business killing the innocents, but also the set-ups and seemingly random scenes that will eventually be useful later on in the chase. That is a nice touch and is really welcomed. The ending chase is it's best part, full of suspense and some nice action. The reasoning behind the battle is the majority of the suspense, as the longer it takes to get to the final showdown is less time needed to save one of the victims and the journey to get there through a never-ending series of darkened tunnels also chipping in some as well. The final battle, with the turns in the tide of the fight and the setting placed provide some really nice action scenes that effectively end the movie on a high note. The early scenes in the nightclubs do have an eerie quality to them, and are nicely placed to keep it from being a really drawn-process. The car crash at the beginning, while being slightly overkill, is also one of the best scenes, being a really high-action set-piece that is quite thrilling and is a real spectacle. The pace isn't that terrible, and while it could've shortened some scenes there's really nothing that keeps it from being an overlong film. This really could've been far worse. The Bad News: There isn't a lot here that keeps it from being that great. As mentioned before, the pace isn't that great, and there are some scenes that drag out far longer than possible. The opening car crash is a major example. Once the car hits the woods, the scene could've ended there and still had the set-up necessary for the rest of the movie. There's no reason to drag it out far longer than it is. The many scenes of wandering around listening to the characters attempt to explain what's going on near the end are some other big scenes. That also brings up the other big factor, which is the stupidity of the characters. Major plot points are not revealed by any intelligence on the characters' part, but based on coincidence. The best is the discovery of the motel the killer is staying at. The character happens to drive by it, even though it's been seen through his visions countless time before it and that takes it sheer coincidence that it happened. The CGI at the end is really unrealistic and only just looks fake now as it did then. With a little help, this could've been a lot better. The Final Verdict: There could've been some little fixing to make this a little better, but it's still not that bad as it is. It's not really the worst film of this type, but there is still room for improvement. Give it a shot if it sounds interesting, just don't expect a classic and it'll be a decent watch.

    ***Spoilers may be contained within*** According to this movie's "trivia" section, the book's author, Dean R Koontz, was sorely disappointed in the movie adaptation and asked that his name be removed. He had every right to be peeved. I saw this in theatres when it was released and was soundly disappointed, too. The previews seemed kind of interesting but I have to admit I'm a Christine Lahti fan, even though her role in this is strictly "the wife". The story is that of a man, played by Jeff Goldblum, who, following a near-death experience, finds he is psychically linked with a serial killer, played by Jeremy Sisto, who decides to go after Goldblum's daughter (Alicia Silverstone). A cat-and-mouse thriller with sci-fi overtones. I've never read the Koontz book on which this is based. Goodness knows it can't be any worse. As lead, Goldblum is OK, I guess, though he's given this basic performance before. Lahti, unfortunately, is wasted in a part that could be played by just about ANY actress; it's a step up from "and how was YOUR day, dear?" but not much. Silverstone, charming in "Clueless", here is little more than an irritant, nearly making one rather root for the killer, but she can often be irritating in films, so I can't say if it's the fault of the part as written or the actress. As said villain, Jeremy Sisto has obviously watched every other psycho-on-the-loose movie and decided to "juice it up" a bit: he rolls his eyes, leers, laughs "maniacally", tries to seem intimidating by staring through lowered eyes. Every trick in the book is trotted out in his performance and for naught: he's about as terrifying as a computer geek. Sisto can, in other performances, be hammy, and he's no less so here: one nearly expects to see him studded with cloves and pineapple slices. Oh, it's not TOTALLY his fault, since the pedestrian script practically BEGS for overacting; I suppose if he DIDN'T chew the scenery, it might actually be less entertaining than it already IS. Beyond its psychic-link tricks, the film, in its less-than-chilling climax, throws in, seemingly out of nowhere, the twist that this is almost literally a battle between (of course) good and evil. This is revealed with a scene when Goldblum and Sisto are finally staring one another down, and a shot of red flames are visible in Sisto's eye; suddenly, in response, we see a flash of white-blue light in Goldblum's eye. A moment later, flames shoot and rise from Sisto's body, forming a fireball above him; blue-white rays of light pour forth from a kneeling Goldblum, forming a vaguely female form above him. The combination of film-school "special" effects (if they look cheesy on the SMALL screen, you can't IMAGINE how bad they were in the theatre!), this last-minute twist, and the inability to stretch one's suspension of disbelief any longer, is fatal. I heard several voices in the audience yell out, in unison, "Oh, COME ON!" From some of the reviews listed here, this movie has a fair number of supporters. I can only wonder just what version of this movie they saw.

    While traveling on the road with his wife Lindsay (Christine Lahti) and his daughter Regina (Alicia Silverstone), Hatch Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) has a car accident, hitting a truck and falling with his wife in a river. He dies for more than two hours, but the specialist Dr. Jonas Nyebern (Alfred Molina) successfully brings him back to life. Hatch has some weird premonitions and becomes able to see through the eyes of the psychopath serial killer Vassago (Jeremy Sisto), a young man that killed his mother and his sister and committed suicide and was also brought back to life and now is killing young women and teenagers. When he foresees that Vassago is trying to capture his daughter, Hatch tries to find the criminal first, in spite of Lindsay, Regina and the detective in charge of the investigation believe that he needs psychiatric help. "Hideaway" is another rip-off of "Eye of Laura Mars", I believe the first movie to explore the idea of a person connected to a serial killer through his eyes. "Hideaway" has a good cinematography and special affects, the cast is great and the sequence of the accident of Hatch and Lindsay is excellent. Although not being an original storyline, this attractive movie entertains. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "O Esconderijo" ("The Hiding Place")

    One night, while driving home with his wife and daughter, Hatch (Jeff Goldblum) gets into a car accident which results in his temporary death. Enter Dr. Nyebern, who has developed a unique resuscitation technique that can revive the dead even after a prolonged period of time. After his revival, Hatch begins having visions of young girls being murdered. It turns out that he shares some sort of special link with the deranged killer (Jeremy Sisto), as they have both been to the other side. Unable to convince anyone of his warnings and knowledge, it's only up to Hatch to stop the killer, who may have a target in mind close to Hatch's heart. This film wasn't particularly exciting, scary or suspenseful. In fact, I scoffed at it from time to time. It was quite ridiculous, cheap, trashy, conventional, predictable, and laughable. The special effects were subpar and murky. The best and most inspired scene was during the first five minutes when the killer journeyed in agony towards hell, after committing an atrocious act and then committing suicide. At least that was something I had not seen too often before. The rest of the movie was merely another slasher film in disguise, no matter how high-gloss it seemed. By the end of the film, many questions and plot holes had arisen but were not addressed. Also, the science, law, and technicalities (e.g. maintaining a patient's confidentiality despite being a menace to others) brought up in the film were terribly erroneous. Much of the film was in bad taste. From time to time, the filmmakers treaded on thin ice by depicting questionable, unsavory, and objectionable acts and images. I also thought the film was going to make some point about spirituality, religion, hell, or heaven, but no such luck. Though some characters were not written well or underutilized of their full potentials, the acting was fine, especially Jeremy Sisto's risky performance as the despicable creep. However, I simply did not care for Goldblum's character and was not convinced of his suffering. Some of his actions, reactions, and dialogues were wayward and awkward. Sometimes he made mistakes when he should have known better and was slow to catch on with certain matters. His wife's role (Christine Lahti) was mostly limited and reduced to that of the long-suffering spouse. She was there mostly to lend support when needed, only becoming a more independent and stronger character near the end. Alicia Silverstone's daughter character was limited in scope as well; mainly serving as a plot gimmick for the killer to prey on. There are far better and scarier horror films out there, Hideaway is not one of them. One film that comes to mind is Lord of Illusions, which is more grotesque, violent, gory, and over-the-top, but effective nonetheless. It goes all the way with its unique, nightmarish, and sensational imagery, and knows no boundaries. Unlike Hideaway, it establishes no pretensions of the divine and evil, and engages us with interesting characters whom we care about.

    Hatch Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) seems to be connected with the mind of a murderer after a fatal car accident kills him (he gets better as doctors bring him back to the land of the living after around 2 hours of being not on this mortal coil. The thing is that while he was deceased so was a serial killer whom also gets revived at around the same time. Now suffering from terrifying visions, he has to solve this mystery before the killer strikes someone close to him (namely his daughter played by Alicia Silverstone) even as everyone thinks he's crazy. When anyone claims that "Batman and Robin" contained the worst acting by Silverstone, I point them to this sorry little flick which she is atrocious in. However that's somehow fitting as this film is uniformly bad in most other aspects as well. Poor Dean Koontz it seems like none of his books will ever translate that well to feature films (and don't even get me started on those "Watcher" films... My Grade: D

    Let me begin with saying, that the movie really isn't that bad. Just make sure you haven't read the book before. If you have, don't watch the movie. Key elements from the plot of the book is either left out completely, or altered so drastically that it has significant negative effect on both the story and for certain characters, the character development throughout the plot. Actually, this is the 3rd Koontz adaptation I've seen in recent history, and I actually thought it couldn't get any worse than "Watchers", but this one is. So far, the least worst movie adaptation I've seen, is "Mr. Murder". So my recommendation, if your going to rent a Koontz movie, is to avoid this one. Read the book instead. It will take more time but will definitely be worth it.

    I have to admit, I watched 'Hideaway' because I had quite high expectations of Jeremy Sisto playing the evil guy. And it has to be said, he is fun watching in his role of Vassago. His angelic looks combined with being a 'very bad boy' is an enjoyable combination (especially when he is taking a shower ;-) ). But enough praises for being sexy. Goldblum's performance is also fine. I was less convinced though about Lindsey Harrison, but it might also be that the plot just wasn't really on her hands. The dialogs were often pretty unconvincing and annoying. But the worst part of the movie was the incredibly cheesy end. As soon as the battle between good and bad started, my jaw dropped and I could only laugh. It wasn't all that good till that point, but the end really ruined everything that was still left of the movie. It's not that we are talking about the ineffectiveness of the still young era of computer effects, it was just.. all... just..... yes, terribly, terribly cheesy. If the script would have been better worked out, with better dialogs and a better pace, I might have given it a 6 or 7. But without that dialog and a better pace, and with an ending like this, I can not come up with more then a 4.

    Hatch, his wife Lindsey and their daughter Regina are in a car accident one night, which sees Hatch supposedly die to only be brought back to life on the operating table by Dr. Jonas Nyebern after being dead for a short period . After this miracle he begins having odd flashes / visions that he has trouble dealing with as they seem so real, as Dr. Nyebern seems to be hiding something about his work. Hatch would discover later that he actually has a special connection with a vicious psychopathic serial killer that can see through his eyes and he can see through theirs. Is there a special link to this, or is Hatch loosing his mind? A respectable, but stock-like psychic thriller adapted from a Dean R. Koontz novelisation, which bestows a capable bunch of actors in the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Christine Lahti, Alicia Silverstone (a wholesome turn before making herself big in "Clueless"), Jeremy Sisto and Alfred Molina. Director Brett Leonard (from the "The Dead Pit") brings to the feature the computer special effects that shrouded his previous sci-fi film "The Lawnmower Man", but for "Hideaway" it's only used in minor doses in the sequences involving the afterlife / out of body experiences. Although it lets loose towards the film's rampaging, if overdone climax in a good vs. evil confrontation of souls in illuminating lights, but the computer effects for its period are well done for most part. Nevertheless it's compellingly delivered, even though it consists of some clumpy dialogues and holds quite a stringy plot that has you questioning details for them to only unfold the further it went. When it decided to feed us some of the niggling queries (it opens up a can of worms) to clear up any confusion and this is when it suddenly turned mechanical and unassuming in its plot progression. Gone was the hauntingly edgy and sombre atmospherics of looming nightmares of a character trying to make sense of the erratically jarring images plaguing his mind. Was he unknowingly committing these acts in some sort of blackout or was he tunnelling somebody else's sight? Now it would be replaced with the standard over-the-top race against the clock with the family in peril get-up. This type of story has been done plenty of times before, but Goldblum's sober turn is an interesting one and Leonard's sickly crafted, well paced direction is visually appealing in its dourly under lit, but well filtered tones and glassily etched-out suspense. Gale Tattersall's expressive photography is lean, but precise. Sisto's homicidal serial killer performance at first is sinisterly creepy, but as it went along it began to grate away with his eccentricity opting out. Trevor Jones' music score is hauntingly harmonious in its arrangement and the Gothic / industrial rock soundtrack is fitting. Also after the credits finish rolling there's an unnecessary tacked on shock sequence with "Carrie" getting a reference.

    Yes, Jurassic Park used computer generated images very well. However, they had a big budget and were able to make those dinosaurs look very realistic. This one ended up making very bad images of hell and of weird crap that looked as if it were not there. Jeff Goldblum was in both, coincidence? Yes, but still he was in one of the best examples of early computer images and one of the worst. What makes it more terrible is that a lot of horror movies began doing it, and to this day the monsters in these movies still look like they are not there. So the story in this one has two guys dying and being revived by similar means. One a family guy with a daughter, the other guy...well lets just say he is not so good. The guy who is not so good has a secret about his death, he is also a killer. The other guy (Goldblum) seems to have a link to this killer because of the way they were both revived. Near the end the killer targets the teen daughter and the father must try to pry her from this seemingly evil guy's clutches. Just did not really work for me, and apparently not to Dean Koontz either as I hear he did not like this movie at all. It has a somewhat good cast for a horror movie as along with Goldblum you have Alicia Silverstone and Alfred Molino, but one just can not get the lame effects out of one's head.

    Not long after losing one of his two daughters in a car accident, family man and antique store owner Jeff Goldblum suffers his own car trauma and literally dies momentarily; a doctor brings him back to life, but it seems Goldblum has brought good and evil powers back with him from the other side: he is now telepathically entwined with a psychopath who hunts young women. Based on a Dean Koontz novel, this low-grade thriller has one of the laziest screenplays I've ever come across. Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and Neal Jimenez don't seem to have a shred of verisimilitude when it comes to writing dialogue for their equally unreal characters--nobody behaves the way regular people would. Christine Lahti is Goldblum's ineffective wife, Alfred Molina is Goldblum's ineffective doctor, Kenneth Welsh is an ineffective detective. They're all walking contrivances in this half-cocked adaptation, which allegedly embarrassed best-selling author Koontz (if it didn't, it should have). Just back from the hospital, Goldblum begins having nightmares that look like bits and pieces of a heavy metal video; the viewer is cued up for the obligatory waking-up-with-a-jolt-from-a-nightmare close-up (and the movie doesn't disappoint). Turns out there's a killer in town (Jeremy Sisto) who gets around from place to place with effortless, alarming accuracy; when he's not hanging out at a sleazy motel--which isn't even listed with information--he's holed up at a derelict amusement park (seems he conveniently has the place all to himself). Of course, nobody takes note that Sisto's latest victim looks like Goldblum's other daughter (Alicia Silverstone, who does nothing but whine), nor does wife Lahti take into account that just maybe her husband knows what he's talking about when he says their kid is in danger. The movie makes absolutely no sense from a logical stand-point, though all of this is rendered inconsequential once Jeff and Christine arrive for a showdown with Sisto near the park's Big Slide ride. The results of this stillborn finale are so shameful, one can only hope Goldblum and company were well-paid for not looking outraged. NO STARS from ****

    "Hideaway" really wasn't as bad as it could've been, but it's not all that great as it is. **SPOILERS** Coming home from their ski-top resort, Hatch, (Jeff Goldblum) and Lindsey Harrison, (Christine Lahti) and his troubled daughter Regina, (Alicia Silverstone) are involved in a horrific car accident, and Hatch is brought back from the dead afterwards. After being normal for a few days, he begins to have weird nightmares and visions, and Dr. Jonas Nybern, (Alfred Molina) confirms it's nothing. Despite the reassurance, he still has the visions of a strange man attacking people, all done with his mind. Eventually learning that the man is named Jeremy, (Jeremy Sisto) and that he had been brought back to life Hatch's recovery from the accident after himself dying. As he begins a city-wide rampage that includes Regina in his targets, Hatch races to stop him before he can fully return from the dark side.

Enter Dr. Nyebern, who has developed a unique resuscitation technique that can revive the dead even after a prolonged period of time. After his revival, Hatch begins having visions of young girls being murdered. It turns out that he shares some sort of special link with the deranged killer (Jeremy Sisto), as they have both been to the other side. Unable to convince anyone of his warnings and knowledge, it's only up to Hatch to stop the killer, who may have a target in mind close to Hatch's heart. This film wasn't particularly exciting, scary or suspenseful. In fact, I scoffed at it from time to time. It was quite ridiculous, cheap, trashy, conventional, predictable, and laughable. The special effects were subpar and murky. The best and most inspired scene was during the first five minutes when the killer journeyed in agony towards hell, after committing an atrocious act and then committing suicide. At least that was something I had not seen too often before. The rest of the movie was merely another slasher film in disguise, no matter how high-gloss it seemed. By the end of the film, many questions and plot holes had arisen but were not addressed. Also, the science, law, and technicalities (e.g. maintaining a patient's confidentiality despite being a menace to others) brought up in the film were terribly erroneous. Much of the film was in bad taste. From time to time, the filmmakers treaded on thin ice by depicting questionable, unsavory, and objectionable acts and images. I also thought the film was going to make some point about spirituality, religion, hell, or heaven, but no such luck. Though some characters were not written well or underutilized of their full potentials, the acting was fine, especially Jeremy Sisto's risky performance as the despicable creep. However, I simply did not care for Goldblum's character and was not convinced of his suffering. Some of his actions, reactions, and dialogues were wayward and awkward. Sometimes he made mistakes when he should have known better and was slow to catch on with certain matters. His wife's role (Christine Lahti) was mostly limited and reduced to that of the long-suffering spouse. She was there mostly to lend support when needed, only becoming a more independent and stronger character near the end. Alicia Silverstone's daughter character was limited in scope as well; mainly serving as a plot gimmick for the killer to prey on. There are far better and scarier horror films out there, Hideaway is not one of them. One film that comes to mind is Lord of Illusions, which is more grotesque, violent, gory, and over-the-top, but effective nonetheless. It goes all the way with its unique, nightmarish, and sensational imagery, and knows no boundaries. Unlike Hideaway, it establishes no pretensions of the divine and evil, and engages us with interesting characters whom we care about.

    Hatch Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) seems to be connected with the mind of a murderer after a fatal car accident kills him (he gets better as doctors bring him back to the land of the living after around 2 hours of being not on this mortal coil. The thing is that while he was deceased so was a serial killer whom also gets revived at around the same time. Now suffering from terrifying visions, he has to solve this mystery before the killer strikes someone close to him (namely his daughter played by Alicia Silverstone) even as everyone thinks he's crazy. When anyone claims that "Batman and Robin" contained the worst acting by Silverstone, I point them to this sorry little flick which she is atrocious in. However that's somehow fitting as this film is uniformly bad in most other aspects as well. Poor Dean Koontz it seems like none of his books will ever translate that well to feature films (and don't even get me started on those "Watcher" films... My Grade: D

    Let me begin with saying, that the movie really isn't that bad. Just make sure you haven't read the book before. If you have, don't watch the movie. Key elements from the plot of the book is either left out completely, or altered so drastically that it has significant negative effect on both the story and for certain characters, the character development throughout the plot. Actually, this is the 3rd Koontz adaptation I've seen in recent history, and I actually thought it couldn't get any worse than "Watchers", but this one is. So far, the least worst movie adaptation I've seen, is "Mr. Murder". So my recommendation, if your going to rent a Koontz movie, is to avoid this one. Read the book instead. It will take more time but will definitely be worth it.

    I have to admit, I watched 'Hideaway' because I had quite high expectations of Jeremy Sisto playing the evil guy. And it has to be said, he is fun watching in his role of Vassago. His angelic looks combined with being a 'very bad boy' is an enjoyable combination (especially when he is taking a shower ;-) ). But enough praises for being sexy. Goldblum's performance is also fine. I was less convinced though about Lindsey Harrison, but it might also be that the plot just wasn't really on her hands. The dialogs were often pretty unconvincing and annoying. But the worst part of the movie was the incredibly cheesy end. As soon as the battle between good and bad started, my jaw dropped and I could only laugh. It wasn't all that good till that point, but the end really ruined everything that was still left of the movie. It's not that we are talking about the ineffectiveness of the still young era of computer effects, it was just.. all... just..... yes, terribly, terribly cheesy. If the script would have been better worked out, with better dialogs and a better pace, I might have given it a 6 or 7. But without that dialog and a better pace, and with an ending like this, I can not come up with more then a 4.

    Hatch, his wife Lindsey and their daughter Regina are in a car accident one night, which sees Hatch supposedly die to only be brought back to life on the operating table by Dr. Jonas Nyebern after being dead for a short period . After this miracle he begins having odd flashes / visions that he has trouble dealing with as they seem so real, as Dr. Nyebern seems to be hiding something about his work. Hatch would discover later that he actually has a special connection with a vicious psychopathic serial killer that can see through his eyes and he can see through theirs. Is there a special link to this, or is Hatch loosing his mind? A respectable, but stock-like psychic thriller adapted from a Dean R. Koontz novelisation, which bestows a capable bunch of actors in the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Christine Lahti, Alicia Silverstone (a wholesome turn before making herself big in "Clueless"), Jeremy Sisto and Alfred Molina. Director Brett Leonard (from the "The Dead Pit") brings to the feature the computer special effects that shrouded his previous sci-fi film "The Lawnmower Man", but for "Hideaway" it's only used in minor doses in the sequences involving the afterlife / out of body experiences. Although it lets loose towards the film's rampaging, if overdone climax in a good vs. evil confrontation of souls in illuminating lights, but the computer effects for its period are well done for most part. Nevertheless it's compellingly delivered, even though it consists of some clumpy dialogues and holds quite a stringy plot that has you questioning details for them to only unfold the further it went. When it decided to feed us some of the niggling queries (it opens up a can of worms) to clear up any confusion and this is when it suddenly turned mechanical and unassuming in its plot progression. Gone was the hauntingly edgy and sombre atmospherics of looming nightmares of a character trying to make sense of the erratically jarring images plaguing his mind. Was he unknowingly committing these acts in some sort of blackout or was he tunnelling somebody else's sight? Now it would be replaced with the standard over-the-top race against the clock with the family in peril get-up. This type of story has been done plenty of times before, but Goldblum's sober turn is an interesting one and Leonard's sickly crafted, well paced direction is visually appealing in its dourly under lit, but well filtered tones and glassily etched-out suspense. Gale Tattersall's expressive photography is lean, but precise. Sisto's homicidal serial killer performance at first is sinisterly creepy, but as it went along it began to grate away with his eccentricity opting out. Trevor Jones' music score is hauntingly harmonious in its arrangement and the Gothic / industrial rock soundtrack is fitting. Also after the credits finish rolling there's an unnecessary tacked on shock sequence with "Carrie" getting a reference.

    Yes, Jurassic Park used computer generated images very well. However, they had a big budget and were able to make those dinosaurs look very realistic. This one ended up making very bad images of hell and of weird crap that looked as if it were not there. Jeff Goldblum was in both, coincidence? Yes, but still he was in one of the best examples of early computer images and one of the worst. What makes it more terrible is that a lot of horror movies began doing it, and to this day the monsters in these movies still look like they are not there. So the story in this one has two guys dying and being revived by similar means. One a family guy with a daughter, the other guy...well lets just say he is not so good. The guy who is not so good has a secret about his death, he is also a killer. The other guy (Goldblum) seems to have a link to this killer because of the way they were both revived. Near the end the killer targets the teen daughter and the father must try to pry her from this seemingly evil guy's clutches. Just did not really work for me, and apparently not to Dean Koontz either as I hear he did not like this movie at all. It has a somewhat good cast for a horror movie as along with Goldblum you have Alicia Silverstone and Alfred Molino, but one just can not get the lame effects out of one's head.

    Not long after losing one of his two daughters in a car accident, family man and antique store owner Jeff Goldblum suffers his own car trauma and literally dies momentarily; a doctor brings him back to life, but it seems Goldblum has brought good and evil powers back with him from the other side: he is now telepathically entwined with a psychopath who hunts young women. Based on a Dean Koontz novel, this low-grade thriller has one of the laziest screenplays I've ever come across. Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and Neal Jimenez don't seem to have a shred of verisimilitude when it comes to writing dialogue for their equally unreal characters--nobody behaves the way regular people would. Christine Lahti is Goldblum's ineffective wife, Alfred Molina is Goldblum's ineffective doctor, Kenneth Welsh is an ineffective detective. They're all walking contrivances in this half-cocked adaptation, which allegedly embarrassed best-selling author Koontz (if it didn't, it should have). Just back from the hospital, Goldblum begins having nightmares that look like bits and pieces of a heavy metal video; the viewer is cued up for the obligatory waking-up-with-a-jolt-from-a-nightmare close-up (and the movie doesn't disappoint). Turns out there's a killer in town (Jeremy Sisto) who gets around from place to place with effortless, alarming accuracy; when he's not hanging out at a sleazy motel--which isn't even listed with information--he's holed up at a derelict amusement park (seems he conveniently has the place all to himself). Of course, nobody takes note that Sisto's latest victim looks like Goldblum's other daughter (Alicia Silverstone, who does nothing but whine), nor does wife Lahti take into account that just maybe her husband knows what he's talking about when he says their kid is in danger. The movie makes absolutely no sense from a logical stand-point, though all of this is rendered inconsequential once Jeff and Christine arrive for a showdown with Sisto near the park's Big Slide ride. The results of this stillborn finale are so shameful, one can only hope Goldblum and company were well-paid for not looking outraged. NO STARS from ****

    "Hideaway" really wasn't as bad as it could've been, but it's not all that great as it is. **SPOILERS** Coming home from their ski-top resort, Hatch, (Jeff Goldblum) and Lindsey Harrison, (Christine Lahti) and his troubled daughter Regina, (Alicia Silverstone) are involved in a horrific car accident, and Hatch is brought back from the dead afterwards. After being normal for a few days, he begins to have weird nightmares and visions, and Dr. Jonas Nybern, (Alfred Molina) confirms it's nothing. Despite the reassurance, he still has the visions of a strange man attacking people, all done with his mind. Eventually learning that the man is named Jeremy, (Jeremy Sisto) and that he had been brought back to life Hatch's recovery from the accident after himself dying. As he begins a city-wide rampage that includes Regina in his targets, Hatch races to stop him before he can fully return from the dark side. The Good News: This wasn't all that bad of a film and did contain some nice moments. The fact that the film does use a fairly routine and clich&eacute;d storyline into something actually decent. The fact that an ordinary man is in contact with a demonic entity is done before and done quite well, but this is still a very watchable film. They use the technique well and make it a very worthwhile watch. That also has an added bonus in being able to give the film a large amount of suspense through this, and it does have a creepy tone throughout. The visions are thankfully not just of the killer going about his business killing the innocents, but also the set-ups and seemingly random scenes that will eventually be useful later on in the chase. That is a nice touch and is really welcomed. The ending chase is it's best part, full of suspense and some nice action. The reasoning behind the battle is the majority of the suspense, as the longer it takes to get to the final showdown is less time needed to save one of the victims and the journey to get there through a never-ending series of darkened tunnels also chipping in some as well. The final battle, with the turns in the tide of the fight and the setting placed provide some really nice action scenes that effectively end the movie on a high note. The early scenes in the nightclubs do have an eerie quality to them, and are nicely placed to keep it from being a really drawn-process. The car crash at the beginning, while being slightly overkill, is also one of the best scenes, being a really high-action set-piece that is quite thrilling and is a real spectacle. The pace isn't that terrible, and while it could've shortened some scenes there's really nothing that keeps it from being an overlong film. This really could've been far worse. The Bad News: There isn't a lot here that keeps it from being that great. As mentioned before, the pace isn't that great, and there are some scenes that drag out far longer than possible. The opening car crash is a major example. Once the car hits the woods, the scene could've ended there and still had the set-up necessary for the rest of the movie. There's no reason to drag it out far longer than it is. The many scenes of wandering around listening to the characters attempt to explain what's going on near the end are some other big scenes. That also brings up the other big factor, which is the stupidity of the characters. Major plot points are not revealed by any intelligence on the characters' part, but based on coincidence. The best is the discovery of the motel the killer is staying at. The character happens to drive by it, even though it's been seen through his visions countless time before it and that takes it sheer coincidence that it happened. The CGI at the end is really unrealistic and only just looks fake now as it did then. With a little help, this could've been a lot better. The Final Verdict: There could've been some little fixing to make this a little better, but it's still not that bad as it is. It's not really the worst film of this type, but there is still room for improvement. Give it a shot if it sounds interesting, just don't expect a classic and it'll be a decent watch. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity

    ***Spoilers may be contained within*** According to this movie's "trivia" section, the book's author, Dean R Koontz, was sorely disappointed in the movie adaptation and asked that his name be removed. He had every right to be peeved. I saw this in theatres when it was released and was soundly disappointed, too. The previews seemed kind of interesting but I have to admit I'm a Christine Lahti fan, even though her role in this is strictly "the wife". The story is that of a man, played by Jeff Goldblum, who, following a near-death experience, finds he is psychically linked with a serial killer, played by Jeremy Sisto, who decides to go after Goldblum's daughter (Alicia Silverstone). A cat-and-mouse thriller with sci-fi overtones. I've never read the Koontz book on which this is based. Goodness knows it can't be any worse. As lead, Goldblum is OK, I guess, though he's given this basic performance before. Lahti, unfortunately, is wasted in a part that could be played by just about ANY actress; it's a step up from "and how was YOUR day, dear?" but not much. Silverstone, charming in "Clueless", here is little more than an irritant, nearly making one rather root for the killer, but she can often be irritating in films, so I can't say if it's the fault of the part as written or the actress. As said villain, Jeremy Sisto has obviously watched every other psycho-on-the-loose movie and decided to "juice it up" a bit: he rolls his eyes, leers, laughs "maniacally", tries to seem intimidating by staring through lowered eyes. Every trick in the book is trotted out in his performance and for naught: he's about as terrifying as a computer geek. Sisto can, in other performances, be hammy, and he's no less so here: one nearly expects to see him studded with cloves and pineapple slices. Oh, it's not TOTALLY his fault, since the pedestrian script practically BEGS for overacting; I suppose if he DIDN'T chew the scenery, it might actually be less entertaining than it already IS. Beyond its psychic-link tricks, the film, in its less-than-chilling climax, throws in, seemingly out of nowhere, the twist that this is almost literally a battle between (of course) good and evil. This is revealed with a scene when Goldblum and Sisto are finally staring one another down, and a shot of red flames are visible in Sisto's eye; suddenly, in response, we see a flash of white-blue light in Goldblum's eye. A moment later, flames shoot and rise from Sisto's body, forming a fireball above him; blue-white rays of light pour forth from a kneeling Goldblum, forming a vaguely female form above him. The combination of film-school "special" effects (if they look cheesy on the SMALL screen, you can't IMAGINE how bad they were in the theatre!), this last-minute twist, and the inability to stretch one's suspension of disbelief any longer, is fatal. I heard several voices in the audience yell out, in unison, "Oh, COME ON!" From some of the reviews listed here, this movie has a fair number of supporters. I can only wonder just what version of this movie they saw.

    While traveling on the road with his wife Lindsay (Christine Lahti) and his daughter Regina (Alicia Silverstone), Hatch Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) has a car accident, hitting a truck and falling with his wife in a river. He dies for more than two hours, but the specialist Dr. Jonas Nyebern (Alfred Molina) successfully brings him back to life. Hatch has some weird premonitions and becomes able to see through the eyes of the psychopath serial killer Vassago (Jeremy Sisto), a young man that killed his mother and his sister and committed suicide and was also brought back to life and now is killing young women and teenagers. When he foresees that Vassago is trying to capture his daughter, Hatch tries to find the criminal first, in spite of Lindsay, Regina and the detective in charge of the investigation believe that he needs psychiatric help. "Hideaway" is another rip-off of "Eye of Laura Mars", I believe the first movie to explore the idea of a person connected to a serial killer through his eyes. "Hideaway" has a good cinematography and special affects, the cast is great and the sequence of the accident of Hatch and Lindsay is excellent. Although not being an original storyline, this attractive movie entertains. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "O Esconderijo" ("The Hiding Place")
