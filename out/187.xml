    A very worthy successor and another splendid film from Francis Ford Coppola. Seeing young Vito Corleone and the start of his empire was really interesting. I liked the way the film constantly juxtaposes flashbacks of his early years with the present time. It also focuses on Michael, who is now head of the family and has to deal with the responsibilities and risks of being in that position. There were many suspenseful and shocking scenes, but also some fine emotional moments as well. Once again, Coppola extracts the absolute best from the cast involved and we have memorable performances here. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was just incredible. You notice how much he's changed just by looking at his facial expressions. Now he's a cold-blooded, ruthless and determined individual. By the end of the The Godfather: Part II, you have that feeling of shock and amazement by Michael's extreme decisions, just like in the first film. Robert de Niro was also brilliant and totally nailed Marlon Brando's mannerisms and the way he talked as Vito Corleone. John Cazale played Fredo again and he also gave a powerful performance, with his final confrontation with Michael being one of my favorite moments.

    The godfather was a game changing, genre defining amazing movie. The godfather part II took the next step and showed Hollywood that sequels work if well directed. It was better than the first one and it got everything right, from the pace, and the acting to the sets. It was a true wonder of movie making and it stands today as one of the, if not the greatest sequel of all time. For today's standards it can be considered a bit too long, but it never gets boring. The two stories could each stand up as their own movies and still be interesting. It is easy to understand Francis Ford Coppola's fame after watching this long, tense and brilliantly shot masterpiece. Thank you for reading Signed: The movie geek

    Francis Ford Coppola returns to direct this brilliant sequel that matches the original, a stunning achievement. Story continues the saga of the Corleone family, which sees the return of Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, and John Cazale. Robert De Nero joins the cast as a young Vito Corleone, who is forced to leave his native Sicily as a boy, then arrives in New York city, where he grows to be an ambitious man who challenges a local corrupt gangster, takes him out in memorable fashion, then sets up the beginning of his empire. Film contrasts that with the ambitions of his son Michael, who is building his father's business in ways he never would have imagined, but in ways that will come at a very high cost indeed... Just as engrossing as the first, with a brilliant script and performances. A timeless classic that won Academy Awards for Best Picture(like Part I), supporting actor De Nero, but also for director Coppola himself(overdue!)

    What can i say, that hasn't been already told? this is the kind of movie no one should miss! When i saw the godfather part 1 i was thinking to myself, there couldn't be other movie better than this masterpiece! Well, i was wrong! The godfather part 2 is even better! yes, even better than part 1.If godfather 1 was that good, the godfather part 2 is even better. From the beginning of the end, you can clearly see that this movie has no flaws! i mean there couldn't be any movie out there without flaws. Well thats wrong, this is the perfect movie! From acting, to directing, from the script to film editing and sound or visual effects, everything is perfect! This is probably one of the greatest achievements in cinema history! Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself! Coppola made some extraordinary movies such as apocalypse now, the conversation and now the godfather! but with godfather part 2's release, everything changed, i mean i though no movie could surpass godfather, and yet the part 2 did just that! Do me a favor, and if u have the chance to watch this, do it, but after you watched part 1 first! This is Coppola's greatest achievement, and quite possibly the greatest movie in cinema history! 10 out of 10

    A great film in its own right, independent of the first. I wasn't particularly fond of Michael Coreleone, especially as his character developed. He became very cold and obsessed with power and respect. What he lacked was the unity and family love of his father, Vito's great empire, one wholly based on love. Michael looses touch with reality and loses control, he sees everything which is real break right in front of him. An epic film with truly great actors. I think in the scene with Michael and all his brothers near the end shows how he, even back before he was tarnished with greed, wasn't a family orientated man. He wanted to live for himself, be successful on his own accord. Join the Marines. He never had plans to become part of the mafia. The reward of power and greed became too much until it suffocated him.

    This movie is three hours and twenty two minutes long but an hour passes like 15 minutes.It is incredibly entertaining and one of the best gangster movie ever made. The plot is tricky featuring two parallel story lines,one of young Vito Corleone fighting with life's dark events,providing for his family,building a Don status and seeking revenge for the killing of his family while other depicts the Michael Corleone and his falling empire,family and life. Al Pacino is stand out in the movie cast.You just see the expressions and his eyes it can tell you the whole story. He has completely transformed to a ruthless,heartless and cold gangster but never stopped loving his family. The scene where Kay(Diane Keaton) tells him about that she aborted their child,Al is flawless and most realistic how his eyes pops out and how he knocks her down.He deserved the Oscar for best actor. Robert De Niro is impeccable.What do you expect when two of the greatest actors play two of the greatest characters. De Niro portrays the character with similar talent as Marlon Brando did. The way he speaks with same husky voice also his sicilian. His principles,taking care of things,returning the favor and rise to mafia is just marvelous. The best scenes are where he follows Fannuci at Festa to his house and kills him other one ,obviously where he stabs Don Ciccio and says "My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you" is just brilliant. Diane Keaton portrays her character with utter excellence. Robert Duvall is as great as he was in the previous movie,the sophisticated lawyer ,caring brother and a good man. John Cazale character is bigger in this one and he is first class in the scene where he yells his heart out and in the whole movie. Michael Vincente Gazzo's performance is most realistic. The screenplay,style and violence is top notch. Again.Coppola's direction is mesmerizing. Overall,this is one of the best movie and not to be missed.

    Francis Ford Coppola directs the sequel of "The Godfather" the "The Godfather: Part II". "The Godfather: Part II" is a movie that show us the history of Corleone family and also show us how Vito Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba. In this movie you will see an another perfect performance by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (nominated for Oscar as Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role). An another good performance made by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. "The Godfather: Part II" is a really good movie but is a little lower than the first movie that explains my title "Touching perfection...", but it continues to be the best sequel of all times.

    "Its like sayin' that you have the recipe of Coca-Cola but you wouldn't make another bottle" Mario Puzo said this when Francis Coppola refused to make this movie. The initial scene in this movie was inspired by many movies, which I'd refuse to disclose to avoid spoilers. Even these days we find a Part -2 of a movie would feature a similar screenplay but this isn't the case in Godfather 2 movie. It is both a sequel and a prequel of the first . It shows what happens before Godfather part-1 and what happens after. Robert Niro's role as the vibrant young Vito matches Brando's' Don Vito in the first. I would suggest the movie lovers to watch after GF part 1 so as to understand the characters better . Also I highly recommend to watch both completes this epic.

    The Godfather: Part 2 is a unbelievably great movie with a brilliant storyline that goes on for a long time but it never gets boring,in fact when it was over I felt like there could have been more,thats how great it is,and the cast is incredible.Its one of the only sequels that people consider just as good,or even better,than the original than the first.In all honesty though,I don't really agree with that statement,the first Godfather is just so brilliant,I don't think this one is better,mainly because of Marlon Brando.Robert De Niro did a fantastic,but he just can't beat Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone.I also think that they should have broken this movie up in to two separate movies,because a lot of it felt a bit too ppushed together since they were trying to tell both Michael and Vito's story,they would have had more time if they told both stories in two different movies,because I really felt Vito Corleone's story could have been more detailed.But other than that,this movie is a real classic,fans of the first Godfather will not be disappointed by this sequel. Stars where the first Godfather left off as we see Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) rise to power,meanwhile,the movie also recounts the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro).

    The Godfather: Part II is perhaps the most famous example of a sequel generally held in as high regard as its predecessor and it's easy to see why; where part I was about Michael's rise, this is about the fall which I think ceteris paribus makes for a better film. Personally I think it's probably slightly weaker than Part I due to the stories being a tad weaker and less focused. Being 25 minutes longer, one might think that it's grander in scope or more elaborate but it really consists of two less elaborate stories; in present time, we get to follow Michael Corleone's aforementioned fall, while a flashback chronicles his father Vito's rise to power during his formative years. That being said, the two stories are interwoven and juxtaposed quite elegantly. Michael begins with getting his hand kissed as a newly appointed "don", and ends with him symbolically left alone at the kitchen table of a family dinner during a flashback. Vito starts at rock bottom, having been made an orphan and forced to leave Sicily for America, and ends up if not on the top, but then well on his way. As another contrast, we get to see shots of Vito's family (including Michael as a baby) flourishing right after Michael's marriage is falling apart. Furthermore, Part II does contain some of the best stuff of the trilogy, especially towards the last half hour or so when all story lines come together quite beautifully; the marital breakdown of Michael and Kay. The conversation between Tom Hagen and Frankie Pentangeli followed by the latter's suicide. The visceral and character building scene in which Vito shoots Fanucci. And maybe the most striking of them all  the calamity of Fredo's (John Cazale outplaying everyone in the impeccable ensemble) death, happening off-screen as if it was too cruel to show the viewers. Better or not, this is in all respects a fine continuation and expansion upon the previous film and unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I.

I liked the way the film constantly juxtaposes flashbacks of his early years with the present time. It also focuses on Michael, who is now head of the family and has to deal with the responsibilities and risks of being in that position. There were many suspenseful and shocking scenes, but also some fine emotional moments as well. Once again, Coppola extracts the absolute best from the cast involved and we have memorable performances here. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was just incredible. You notice how much he's changed just by looking at his facial expressions. Now he's a cold-blooded, ruthless and determined individual. By the end of the The Godfather: Part II, you have that feeling of shock and amazement by Michael's extreme decisions, just like in the first film. Robert de Niro was also brilliant and totally nailed Marlon Brando's mannerisms and the way he talked as Vito Corleone. John Cazale played Fredo again and he also gave a powerful performance, with his final confrontation with Michael being one of my favorite moments.

    The godfather was a game changing, genre defining amazing movie. The godfather part II took the next step and showed Hollywood that sequels work if well directed. It was better than the first one and it got everything right, from the pace, and the acting to the sets. It was a true wonder of movie making and it stands today as one of the, if not the greatest sequel of all time. For today's standards it can be considered a bit too long, but it never gets boring. The two stories could each stand up as their own movies and still be interesting. It is easy to understand Francis Ford Coppola's fame after watching this long, tense and brilliantly shot masterpiece. Thank you for reading Signed: The movie geek

    Francis Ford Coppola returns to direct this brilliant sequel that matches the original, a stunning achievement. Story continues the saga of the Corleone family, which sees the return of Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, and John Cazale. Robert De Nero joins the cast as a young Vito Corleone, who is forced to leave his native Sicily as a boy, then arrives in New York city, where he grows to be an ambitious man who challenges a local corrupt gangster, takes him out in memorable fashion, then sets up the beginning of his empire. Film contrasts that with the ambitions of his son Michael, who is building his father's business in ways he never would have imagined, but in ways that will come at a very high cost indeed... Just as engrossing as the first, with a brilliant script and performances. A timeless classic that won Academy Awards for Best Picture(like Part I), supporting actor De Nero, but also for director Coppola himself(overdue!)

    What can i say, that hasn't been already told? this is the kind of movie no one should miss! When i saw the godfather part 1 i was thinking to myself, there couldn't be other movie better than this masterpiece! Well, i was wrong! The godfather part 2 is even better! yes, even better than part 1.If godfather 1 was that good, the godfather part 2 is even better. From the beginning of the end, you can clearly see that this movie has no flaws! i mean there couldn't be any movie out there without flaws. Well thats wrong, this is the perfect movie! From acting, to directing, from the script to film editing and sound or visual effects, everything is perfect! This is probably one of the greatest achievements in cinema history! Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself! Coppola made some extraordinary movies such as apocalypse now, the conversation and now the godfather! but with godfather part 2's release, everything changed, i mean i though no movie could surpass godfather, and yet the part 2 did just that! Do me a favor, and if u have the chance to watch this, do it, but after you watched part 1 first! This is Coppola's greatest achievement, and quite possibly the greatest movie in cinema history! 10 out of 10

    A great film in its own right, independent of the first. I wasn't particularly fond of Michael Coreleone, especially as his character developed. He became very cold and obsessed with power and respect. What he lacked was the unity and family love of his father, Vito's great empire, one wholly based on love. Michael looses touch with reality and loses control, he sees everything which is real break right in front of him. An epic film with truly great actors. I think in the scene with Michael and all his brothers near the end shows how he, even back before he was tarnished with greed, wasn't a family orientated man. He wanted to live for himself, be successful on his own accord. Join the Marines. He never had plans to become part of the mafia. The reward of power and greed became too much until it suffocated him.

    This movie is three hours and twenty two minutes long but an hour passes like 15 minutes.It is incredibly entertaining and one of the best gangster movie ever made. The plot is tricky featuring two parallel story lines,one of young Vito Corleone fighting with life's dark events,providing for his family,building a Don status and seeking revenge for the killing of his family while other depicts the Michael Corleone and his falling empire,family and life. Al Pacino is stand out in the movie cast.You just see the expressions and his eyes it can tell you the whole story. He has completely transformed to a ruthless,heartless and cold gangster but never stopped loving his family. The scene where Kay(Diane Keaton) tells him about that she aborted their child,Al is flawless and most realistic how his eyes pops out and how he knocks her down.He deserved the Oscar for best actor. Robert De Niro is impeccable.What do you expect when two of the greatest actors play two of the greatest characters. De Niro portrays the character with similar talent as Marlon Brando did. The way he speaks with same husky voice also his sicilian. His principles,taking care of things,returning the favor and rise to mafia is just marvelous. The best scenes are where he follows Fannuci at Festa to his house and kills him other one ,obviously where he stabs Don Ciccio and says "My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you" is just brilliant. Diane Keaton portrays her character with utter excellence. Robert Duvall is as great as he was in the previous movie,the sophisticated lawyer ,caring brother and a good man. John Cazale character is bigger in this one and he is first class in the scene where he yells his heart out and in the whole movie. Michael Vincente Gazzo's performance is most realistic. The screenplay,style and violence is top notch. Again.Coppola's direction is mesmerizing. Overall,this is one of the best movie and not to be missed.

    Francis Ford Coppola directs the sequel of "The Godfather" the "The Godfather: Part II". "The Godfather: Part II" is a movie that show us the history of Corleone family and also show us how Vito Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba. In this movie you will see an another perfect performance by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (nominated for Oscar as Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role). An another good performance made by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. "The Godfather: Part II" is a really good movie but is a little lower than the first movie that explains my title "Touching perfection...", but it continues to be the best sequel of all times.

    "Its like sayin' that you have the recipe of Coca-Cola but you wouldn't make another bottle" Mario Puzo said this when Francis Coppola refused to make this movie. The initial scene in this movie was inspired by many movies, which I'd refuse to disclose to avoid spoilers. Even these days we find a Part -2 of a movie would feature a similar screenplay but this isn't the case in Godfather 2 movie. It is both a sequel and a prequel of the first . It shows what happens before Godfather part-1 and what happens after. Robert Niro's role as the vibrant young Vito matches Brando's' Don Vito in the first. I would suggest the movie lovers to watch after GF part 1 so as to understand the characters better . Also I highly recommend to watch both completes this epic.

    The Godfather: Part 2 is a unbelievably great movie with a brilliant storyline that goes on for a long time but it never gets boring,in fact when it was over I felt like there could have been more,thats how great it is,and the cast is incredible.Its one of the only sequels that people consider just as good,or even better,than the original than the first.In all honesty though,I don't really agree with that statement,the first Godfather is just so brilliant,I don't think this one is better,mainly because of Marlon Brando.Robert De Niro did a fantastic,but he just can't beat Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone.I also think that they should have broken this movie up in to two separate movies,because a lot of it felt a bit too ppushed together since they were trying to tell both Michael and Vito's story,they would have had more time if they told both stories in two different movies,because I really felt Vito Corleone's story could have been more detailed.But other than that,this movie is a real classic,fans of the first Godfather will not be disappointed by this sequel. Stars where the first Godfather left off as we see Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) rise to power,meanwhile,the movie also recounts the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro).

    The Godfather: Part II is perhaps the most famous example of a sequel generally held in as high regard as its predecessor and it's easy to see why; where part I was about Michael's rise, this is about the fall which I think ceteris paribus makes for a better film. Personally I think it's probably slightly weaker than Part I due to the stories being a tad weaker and less focused. Being 25 minutes longer, one might think that it's grander in scope or more elaborate but it really consists of two less elaborate stories; in present time, we get to follow Michael Corleone's aforementioned fall, while a flashback chronicles his father Vito's rise to power during his formative years. That being said, the two stories are interwoven and juxtaposed quite elegantly. Michael begins with getting his hand kissed as a newly appointed "don", and ends with him symbolically left alone at the kitchen table of a family dinner during a flashback. Vito starts at rock bottom, having been made an orphan and forced to leave Sicily for America, and ends up if not on the top, but then well on his way. As another contrast, we get to see shots of Vito's family (including Michael as a baby) flourishing right after Michael's marriage is falling apart. Furthermore, Part II does contain some of the best stuff of the trilogy, especially towards the last half hour or so when all story lines come together quite beautifully; the marital breakdown of Michael and Kay. The conversation between Tom Hagen and Frankie Pentangeli followed by the latter's suicide. The visceral and character building scene in which Vito shoots Fanucci. And maybe the most striking of them all  the calamity of Fredo's (John Cazale outplaying everyone in the impeccable ensemble) death, happening off-screen as if it was too cruel to show the viewers. Better or not, this is in all respects a fine continuation and expansion upon the previous film and unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I.

Robert De Nero joins the cast as a young Vito Corleone, who is forced to leave his native Sicily as a boy, then arrives in New York city, where he grows to be an ambitious man who challenges a local corrupt gangster, takes him out in memorable fashion, then sets up the beginning of his empire. Film contrasts that with the ambitions of his son Michael, who is building his father's business in ways he never would have imagined, but in ways that will come at a very high cost indeed... Just as engrossing as the first, with a brilliant script and performances. A timeless classic that won Academy Awards for Best Picture(like Part I), supporting actor De Nero, but also for director Coppola himself(overdue!)

    What can i say, that hasn't been already told? this is the kind of movie no one should miss! When i saw the godfather part 1 i was thinking to myself, there couldn't be other movie better than this masterpiece! Well, i was wrong! The godfather part 2 is even better! yes, even better than part 1.If godfather 1 was that good, the godfather part 2 is even better. From the beginning of the end, you can clearly see that this movie has no flaws! i mean there couldn't be any movie out there without flaws. Well thats wrong, this is the perfect movie! From acting, to directing, from the script to film editing and sound or visual effects, everything is perfect! This is probably one of the greatest achievements in cinema history! Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself! Coppola made some extraordinary movies such as apocalypse now, the conversation and now the godfather! but with godfather part 2's release, everything changed, i mean i though no movie could surpass godfather, and yet the part 2 did just that! Do me a favor, and if u have the chance to watch this, do it, but after you watched part 1 first! This is Coppola's greatest achievement, and quite possibly the greatest movie in cinema history! 10 out of 10

    A great film in its own right, independent of the first. I wasn't particularly fond of Michael Coreleone, especially as his character developed. He became very cold and obsessed with power and respect. What he lacked was the unity and family love of his father, Vito's great empire, one wholly based on love. Michael looses touch with reality and loses control, he sees everything which is real break right in front of him. An epic film with truly great actors. I think in the scene with Michael and all his brothers near the end shows how he, even back before he was tarnished with greed, wasn't a family orientated man. He wanted to live for himself, be successful on his own accord. Join the Marines. He never had plans to become part of the mafia. The reward of power and greed became too much until it suffocated him.

    This movie is three hours and twenty two minutes long but an hour passes like 15 minutes.It is incredibly entertaining and one of the best gangster movie ever made. The plot is tricky featuring two parallel story lines,one of young Vito Corleone fighting with life's dark events,providing for his family,building a Don status and seeking revenge for the killing of his family while other depicts the Michael Corleone and his falling empire,family and life. Al Pacino is stand out in the movie cast.You just see the expressions and his eyes it can tell you the whole story. He has completely transformed to a ruthless,heartless and cold gangster but never stopped loving his family. The scene where Kay(Diane Keaton) tells him about that she aborted their child,Al is flawless and most realistic how his eyes pops out and how he knocks her down.He deserved the Oscar for best actor. Robert De Niro is impeccable.What do you expect when two of the greatest actors play two of the greatest characters. De Niro portrays the character with similar talent as Marlon Brando did. The way he speaks with same husky voice also his sicilian. His principles,taking care of things,returning the favor and rise to mafia is just marvelous. The best scenes are where he follows Fannuci at Festa to his house and kills him other one ,obviously where he stabs Don Ciccio and says "My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you" is just brilliant. Diane Keaton portrays her character with utter excellence. Robert Duvall is as great as he was in the previous movie,the sophisticated lawyer ,caring brother and a good man. John Cazale character is bigger in this one and he is first class in the scene where he yells his heart out and in the whole movie. Michael Vincente Gazzo's performance is most realistic. The screenplay,style and violence is top notch. Again.Coppola's direction is mesmerizing. Overall,this is one of the best movie and not to be missed.

    Francis Ford Coppola directs the sequel of "The Godfather" the "The Godfather: Part II". "The Godfather: Part II" is a movie that show us the history of Corleone family and also show us how Vito Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba. In this movie you will see an another perfect performance by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (nominated for Oscar as Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role). An another good performance made by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. "The Godfather: Part II" is a really good movie but is a little lower than the first movie that explains my title "Touching perfection...", but it continues to be the best sequel of all times.

    "Its like sayin' that you have the recipe of Coca-Cola but you wouldn't make another bottle" Mario Puzo said this when Francis Coppola refused to make this movie. The initial scene in this movie was inspired by many movies, which I'd refuse to disclose to avoid spoilers. Even these days we find a Part -2 of a movie would feature a similar screenplay but this isn't the case in Godfather 2 movie. It is both a sequel and a prequel of the first . It shows what happens before Godfather part-1 and what happens after. Robert Niro's role as the vibrant young Vito matches Brando's' Don Vito in the first. I would suggest the movie lovers to watch after GF part 1 so as to understand the characters better . Also I highly recommend to watch both completes this epic.

    The Godfather: Part 2 is a unbelievably great movie with a brilliant storyline that goes on for a long time but it never gets boring,in fact when it was over I felt like there could have been more,thats how great it is,and the cast is incredible.Its one of the only sequels that people consider just as good,or even better,than the original than the first.In all honesty though,I don't really agree with that statement,the first Godfather is just so brilliant,I don't think this one is better,mainly because of Marlon Brando.Robert De Niro did a fantastic,but he just can't beat Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone.I also think that they should have broken this movie up in to two separate movies,because a lot of it felt a bit too ppushed together since they were trying to tell both Michael and Vito's story,they would have had more time if they told both stories in two different movies,because I really felt Vito Corleone's story could have been more detailed.But other than that,this movie is a real classic,fans of the first Godfather will not be disappointed by this sequel. Stars where the first Godfather left off as we see Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) rise to power,meanwhile,the movie also recounts the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro).

    The Godfather: Part II is perhaps the most famous example of a sequel generally held in as high regard as its predecessor and it's easy to see why; where part I was about Michael's rise, this is about the fall which I think ceteris paribus makes for a better film. Personally I think it's probably slightly weaker than Part I due to the stories being a tad weaker and less focused. Being 25 minutes longer, one might think that it's grander in scope or more elaborate but it really consists of two less elaborate stories; in present time, we get to follow Michael Corleone's aforementioned fall, while a flashback chronicles his father Vito's rise to power during his formative years. That being said, the two stories are interwoven and juxtaposed quite elegantly. Michael begins with getting his hand kissed as a newly appointed "don", and ends with him symbolically left alone at the kitchen table of a family dinner during a flashback. Vito starts at rock bottom, having been made an orphan and forced to leave Sicily for America, and ends up if not on the top, but then well on his way. As another contrast, we get to see shots of Vito's family (including Michael as a baby) flourishing right after Michael's marriage is falling apart. Furthermore, Part II does contain some of the best stuff of the trilogy, especially towards the last half hour or so when all story lines come together quite beautifully; the marital breakdown of Michael and Kay. The conversation between Tom Hagen and Frankie Pentangeli followed by the latter's suicide. The visceral and character building scene in which Vito shoots Fanucci. And maybe the most striking of them all  the calamity of Fredo's (John Cazale outplaying everyone in the impeccable ensemble) death, happening off-screen as if it was too cruel to show the viewers. Better or not, this is in all respects a fine continuation and expansion upon the previous film and unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I.

    A very worthy successor and another splendid film from Francis Ford Coppola. Seeing young Vito Corleone and the start of his empire was really interesting. I liked the way the film constantly juxtaposes flashbacks of his early years with the present time. It also focuses on Michael, who is now head of the family and has to deal with the responsibilities and risks of being in that position. There were many suspenseful and shocking scenes, but also some fine emotional moments as well. Once again, Coppola extracts the absolute best from the cast involved and we have memorable performances here. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was just incredible. You notice how much he's changed just by looking at his facial expressions. Now he's a cold-blooded, ruthless and determined individual. By the end of the The Godfather: Part II, you have that feeling of shock and amazement by Michael's extreme decisions, just like in the first film. Robert de Niro was also brilliant and totally nailed Marlon Brando's mannerisms and the way he talked as Vito Corleone. John Cazale played Fredo again and he also gave a powerful performance, with his final confrontation with Michael being one of my favorite moments.

    The godfather was a game changing, genre defining amazing movie. The godfather part II took the next step and showed Hollywood that sequels work if well directed. It was better than the first one and it got everything right, from the pace, and the acting to the sets. It was a true wonder of movie making and it stands today as one of the, if not the greatest sequel of all time. For today's standards it can be considered a bit too long, but it never gets boring. The two stories could each stand up as their own movies and still be interesting. It is easy to understand Francis Ford Coppola's fame after watching this long, tense and brilliantly shot masterpiece. Thank you for reading Signed: The movie geek

    A great film in its own right, independent of the first. I wasn't particularly fond of Michael Coreleone, especially as his character developed. He became very cold and obsessed with power and respect. What he lacked was the unity and family love of his father, Vito's great empire, one wholly based on love. Michael looses touch with reality and loses control, he sees everything which is real break right in front of him. An epic film with truly great actors. I think in the scene with Michael and all his brothers near the end shows how he, even back before he was tarnished with greed, wasn't a family orientated man. He wanted to live for himself, be successful on his own accord. Join the Marines. He never had plans to become part of the mafia. The reward of power and greed became too much until it suffocated him.

    This movie is three hours and twenty two minutes long but an hour passes like 15 minutes.It is incredibly entertaining and one of the best gangster movie ever made. The plot is tricky featuring two parallel story lines,one of young Vito Corleone fighting with life's dark events,providing for his family,building a Don status and seeking revenge for the killing of his family while other depicts the Michael Corleone and his falling empire,family and life. Al Pacino is stand out in the movie cast.You just see the expressions and his eyes it can tell you the whole story. He has completely transformed to a ruthless,heartless and cold gangster but never stopped loving his family. The scene where Kay(Diane Keaton) tells him about that she aborted their child,Al is flawless and most realistic how his eyes pops out and how he knocks her down.He deserved the Oscar for best actor. Robert De Niro is impeccable.What do you expect when two of the greatest actors play two of the greatest characters. De Niro portrays the character with similar talent as Marlon Brando did. The way he speaks with same husky voice also his sicilian. His principles,taking care of things,returning the favor and rise to mafia is just marvelous. The best scenes are where he follows Fannuci at Festa to his house and kills him other one ,obviously where he stabs Don Ciccio and says "My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you" is just brilliant. Diane Keaton portrays her character with utter excellence. Robert Duvall is as great as he was in the previous movie,the sophisticated lawyer ,caring brother and a good man. John Cazale character is bigger in this one and he is first class in the scene where he yells his heart out and in the whole movie. Michael Vincente Gazzo's performance is most realistic. The screenplay,style and violence is top notch. Again.Coppola's direction is mesmerizing. Overall,this is one of the best movie and not to be missed.

    Francis Ford Coppola directs the sequel of "The Godfather" the "The Godfather: Part II". "The Godfather: Part II" is a movie that show us the history of Corleone family and also show us how Vito Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba. In this movie you will see an another perfect performance by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (nominated for Oscar as Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role). An another good performance made by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. "The Godfather: Part II" is a really good movie but is a little lower than the first movie that explains my title "Touching perfection...", but it continues to be the best sequel of all times.

    "Its like sayin' that you have the recipe of Coca-Cola but you wouldn't make another bottle" Mario Puzo said this when Francis Coppola refused to make this movie. The initial scene in this movie was inspired by many movies, which I'd refuse to disclose to avoid spoilers. Even these days we find a Part -2 of a movie would feature a similar screenplay but this isn't the case in Godfather 2 movie. It is both a sequel and a prequel of the first . It shows what happens before Godfather part-1 and what happens after. Robert Niro's role as the vibrant young Vito matches Brando's' Don Vito in the first. I would suggest the movie lovers to watch after GF part 1 so as to understand the characters better . Also I highly recommend to watch both completes this epic.

    The Godfather: Part 2 is a unbelievably great movie with a brilliant storyline that goes on for a long time but it never gets boring,in fact when it was over I felt like there could have been more,thats how great it is,and the cast is incredible.Its one of the only sequels that people consider just as good,or even better,than the original than the first.In all honesty though,I don't really agree with that statement,the first Godfather is just so brilliant,I don't think this one is better,mainly because of Marlon Brando.Robert De Niro did a fantastic,but he just can't beat Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone.I also think that they should have broken this movie up in to two separate movies,because a lot of it felt a bit too ppushed together since they were trying to tell both Michael and Vito's story,they would have had more time if they told both stories in two different movies,because I really felt Vito Corleone's story could have been more detailed.But other than that,this movie is a real classic,fans of the first Godfather will not be disappointed by this sequel. Stars where the first Godfather left off as we see Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) rise to power,meanwhile,the movie also recounts the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro).

    The Godfather: Part II is perhaps the most famous example of a sequel generally held in as high regard as its predecessor and it's easy to see why; where part I was about Michael's rise, this is about the fall which I think ceteris paribus makes for a better film. Personally I think it's probably slightly weaker than Part I due to the stories being a tad weaker and less focused. Being 25 minutes longer, one might think that it's grander in scope or more elaborate but it really consists of two less elaborate stories; in present time, we get to follow Michael Corleone's aforementioned fall, while a flashback chronicles his father Vito's rise to power during his formative years. That being said, the two stories are interwoven and juxtaposed quite elegantly. Michael begins with getting his hand kissed as a newly appointed "don", and ends with him symbolically left alone at the kitchen table of a family dinner during a flashback. Vito starts at rock bottom, having been made an orphan and forced to leave Sicily for America, and ends up if not on the top, but then well on his way. As another contrast, we get to see shots of Vito's family (including Michael as a baby) flourishing right after Michael's marriage is falling apart. Furthermore, Part II does contain some of the best stuff of the trilogy, especially towards the last half hour or so when all story lines come together quite beautifully; the marital breakdown of Michael and Kay. The conversation between Tom Hagen and Frankie Pentangeli followed by the latter's suicide. The visceral and character building scene in which Vito shoots Fanucci. And maybe the most striking of them all  the calamity of Fredo's (John Cazale outplaying everyone in the impeccable ensemble) death, happening off-screen as if it was too cruel to show the viewers. Better or not, this is in all respects a fine continuation and expansion upon the previous film and unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I.

    A very worthy successor and another splendid film from Francis Ford Coppola. Seeing young Vito Corleone and the start of his empire was really interesting. I liked the way the film constantly juxtaposes flashbacks of his early years with the present time. It also focuses on Michael, who is now head of the family and has to deal with the responsibilities and risks of being in that position. There were many suspenseful and shocking scenes, but also some fine emotional moments as well. Once again, Coppola extracts the absolute best from the cast involved and we have memorable performances here. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was just incredible. You notice how much he's changed just by looking at his facial expressions. Now he's a cold-blooded, ruthless and determined individual. By the end of the The Godfather: Part II, you have that feeling of shock and amazement by Michael's extreme decisions, just like in the first film. Robert de Niro was also brilliant and totally nailed Marlon Brando's mannerisms and the way he talked as Vito Corleone. John Cazale played Fredo again and he also gave a powerful performance, with his final confrontation with Michael being one of my favorite moments.

    The godfather was a game changing, genre defining amazing movie. The godfather part II took the next step and showed Hollywood that sequels work if well directed. It was better than the first one and it got everything right, from the pace, and the acting to the sets. It was a true wonder of movie making and it stands today as one of the, if not the greatest sequel of all time. For today's standards it can be considered a bit too long, but it never gets boring. The two stories could each stand up as their own movies and still be interesting. It is easy to understand Francis Ford Coppola's fame after watching this long, tense and brilliantly shot masterpiece. Thank you for reading Signed: The movie geek

    Francis Ford Coppola returns to direct this brilliant sequel that matches the original, a stunning achievement. Story continues the saga of the Corleone family, which sees the return of Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, and John Cazale. Robert De Nero joins the cast as a young Vito Corleone, who is forced to leave his native Sicily as a boy, then arrives in New York city, where he grows to be an ambitious man who challenges a local corrupt gangster, takes him out in memorable fashion, then sets up the beginning of his empire. Film contrasts that with the ambitions of his son Michael, who is building his father's business in ways he never would have imagined, but in ways that will come at a very high cost indeed... Just as engrossing as the first, with a brilliant script and performances. A timeless classic that won Academy Awards for Best Picture(like Part I), supporting actor De Nero, but also for director Coppola himself(overdue!)

    What can i say, that hasn't been already told? this is the kind of movie no one should miss! When i saw the godfather part 1 i was thinking to myself, there couldn't be other movie better than this masterpiece! Well, i was wrong! The godfather part 2 is even better! yes, even better than part 1.If godfather 1 was that good, the godfather part 2 is even better. From the beginning of the end, you can clearly see that this movie has no flaws! i mean there couldn't be any movie out there without flaws. Well thats wrong, this is the perfect movie! From acting, to directing, from the script to film editing and sound or visual effects, everything is perfect! This is probably one of the greatest achievements in cinema history! Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself! Coppola made some extraordinary movies such as apocalypse now, the conversation and now the godfather! but with godfather part 2's release, everything changed, i mean i though no movie could surpass godfather, and yet the part 2 did just that! Do me a favor, and if u have the chance to watch this, do it, but after you watched part 1 first! This is Coppola's greatest achievement, and quite possibly the greatest movie in cinema history! 10 out of 10

The scene where Kay(Diane Keaton) tells him about that she aborted their child,Al is flawless and most realistic how his eyes pops out and how he knocks her down.He deserved the Oscar for best actor. Robert De Niro is impeccable.What do you expect when two of the greatest actors play two of the greatest characters. De Niro portrays the character with similar talent as Marlon Brando did. The way he speaks with same husky voice also his sicilian. His principles,taking care of things,returning the favor and rise to mafia is just marvelous. The best scenes are where he follows Fannuci at Festa to his house and kills him other one ,obviously where he stabs Don Ciccio and says "My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you" is just brilliant. Diane Keaton portrays her character with utter excellence. Robert Duvall is as great as he was in the previous movie,the sophisticated lawyer ,caring brother and a good man. John Cazale character is bigger in this one and he is first class in the scene where he yells his heart out and in the whole movie. Michael Vincente Gazzo's performance is most realistic. The screenplay,style and violence is top notch. Again.Coppola's direction is mesmerizing. Overall,this is one of the best movie and not to be missed.

    Francis Ford Coppola directs the sequel of "The Godfather" the "The Godfather: Part II". "The Godfather: Part II" is a movie that show us the history of Corleone family and also show us how Vito Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba. In this movie you will see an another perfect performance by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (nominated for Oscar as Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role). An another good performance made by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. "The Godfather: Part II" is a really good movie but is a little lower than the first movie that explains my title "Touching perfection...", but it continues to be the best sequel of all times.

    "Its like sayin' that you have the recipe of Coca-Cola but you wouldn't make another bottle" Mario Puzo said this when Francis Coppola refused to make this movie. The initial scene in this movie was inspired by many movies, which I'd refuse to disclose to avoid spoilers. Even these days we find a Part -2 of a movie would feature a similar screenplay but this isn't the case in Godfather 2 movie. It is both a sequel and a prequel of the first . It shows what happens before Godfather part-1 and what happens after. Robert Niro's role as the vibrant young Vito matches Brando's' Don Vito in the first. I would suggest the movie lovers to watch after GF part 1 so as to understand the characters better . Also I highly recommend to watch both completes this epic.

    The Godfather: Part 2 is a unbelievably great movie with a brilliant storyline that goes on for a long time but it never gets boring,in fact when it was over I felt like there could have been more,thats how great it is,and the cast is incredible.Its one of the only sequels that people consider just as good,or even better,than the original than the first.In all honesty though,I don't really agree with that statement,the first Godfather is just so brilliant,I don't think this one is better,mainly because of Marlon Brando.Robert De Niro did a fantastic,but he just can't beat Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone.I also think that they should have broken this movie up in to two separate movies,because a lot of it felt a bit too ppushed together since they were trying to tell both Michael and Vito's story,they would have had more time if they told both stories in two different movies,because I really felt Vito Corleone's story could have been more detailed.But other than that,this movie is a real classic,fans of the first Godfather will not be disappointed by this sequel. Stars where the first Godfather left off as we see Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) rise to power,meanwhile,the movie also recounts the early life of Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro).

    The Godfather: Part II is perhaps the most famous example of a sequel generally held in as high regard as its predecessor and it's easy to see why; where part I was about Michael's rise, this is about the fall which I think ceteris paribus makes for a better film. Personally I think it's probably slightly weaker than Part I due to the stories being a tad weaker and less focused. Being 25 minutes longer, one might think that it's grander in scope or more elaborate but it really consists of two less elaborate stories; in present time, we get to follow Michael Corleone's aforementioned fall, while a flashback chronicles his father Vito's rise to power during his formative years. That being said, the two stories are interwoven and juxtaposed quite elegantly. Michael begins with getting his hand kissed as a newly appointed "don", and ends with him symbolically left alone at the kitchen table of a family dinner during a flashback. Vito starts at rock bottom, having been made an orphan and forced to leave Sicily for America, and ends up if not on the top, but then well on his way. As another contrast, we get to see shots of Vito's family (including Michael as a baby) flourishing right after Michael's marriage is falling apart. Furthermore, Part II does contain some of the best stuff of the trilogy, especially towards the last half hour or so when all story lines come together quite beautifully; the marital breakdown of Michael and Kay. The conversation between Tom Hagen and Frankie Pentangeli followed by the latter's suicide. The visceral and character building scene in which Vito shoots Fanucci. And maybe the most striking of them all  the calamity of Fredo's (John Cazale outplaying everyone in the impeccable ensemble) death, happening off-screen as if it was too cruel to show the viewers. Better or not, this is in all respects a fine continuation and expansion upon the previous film and unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I.

    A very worthy successor and another splendid film from Francis Ford Coppola. Seeing young Vito Corleone and the start of his empire was really interesting. I liked the way the film constantly juxtaposes flashbacks of his early years with the present time. It also focuses on Michael, who is now head of the family and has to deal with the responsibilities and risks of being in that position. There were many suspenseful and shocking scenes, but also some fine emotional moments as well. Once again, Coppola extracts the absolute best from the cast involved and we have memorable performances here. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone was just incredible. You notice how much he's changed just by looking at his facial expressions. Now he's a cold-blooded, ruthless and determined individual. By the end of the The Godfather: Part II, you have that feeling of shock and amazement by Michael's extreme decisions, just like in the first film. Robert de Niro was also brilliant and totally nailed Marlon Brando's mannerisms and the way he talked as Vito Corleone. John Cazale played Fredo again and he also gave a powerful performance, with his final confrontation with Michael being one of my favorite moments.

    The godfather was a game changing, genre defining amazing movie. The godfather part II took the next step and showed Hollywood that sequels work if well directed. It was better than the first one and it got everything right, from the pace, and the acting to the sets. It was a true wonder of movie making and it stands today as one of the, if not the greatest sequel of all time. For today's standards it can be considered a bit too long, but it never gets boring. The two stories could each stand up as their own movies and still be interesting. It is easy to understand Francis Ford Coppola's fame after watching this long, tense and brilliantly shot masterpiece. Thank you for reading Signed: The movie geek

    Francis Ford Coppola returns to direct this brilliant sequel that matches the original, a stunning achievement. Story continues the saga of the Corleone family, which sees the return of Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, and John Cazale. Robert De Nero joins the cast as a young Vito Corleone, who is forced to leave his native Sicily as a boy, then arrives in New York city, where he grows to be an ambitious man who challenges a local corrupt gangster, takes him out in memorable fashion, then sets up the beginning of his empire. Film contrasts that with the ambitions of his son Michael, who is building his father's business in ways he never would have imagined, but in ways that will come at a very high cost indeed... Just as engrossing as the first, with a brilliant script and performances. A timeless classic that won Academy Awards for Best Picture(like Part I), supporting actor De Nero, but also for director Coppola himself(overdue!)

    What can i say, that hasn't been already told? this is the kind of movie no one should miss! When i saw the godfather part 1 i was thinking to myself, there couldn't be other movie better than this masterpiece! Well, i was wrong! The godfather part 2 is even better! yes, even better than part 1.If godfather 1 was that good, the godfather part 2 is even better. From the beginning of the end, you can clearly see that this movie has no flaws! i mean there couldn't be any movie out there without flaws. Well thats wrong, this is the perfect movie! From acting, to directing, from the script to film editing and sound or visual effects, everything is perfect! This is probably one of the greatest achievements in cinema history! Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself! Coppola made some extraordinary movies such as apocalypse now, the conversation and now the godfather! but with godfather part 2's release, everything changed, i mean i though no movie could surpass godfather, and yet the part 2 did just that! Do me a favor, and if u have the chance to watch this, do it, but after you watched part 1 first! This is Coppola's greatest achievement, and quite possibly the greatest movie in cinema history! 10 out of 10

    A great film in its own right, independent of the first. I wasn't particularly fond of Michael Coreleone, especially as his character developed. He became very cold and obsessed with power and respect. What he lacked was the unity and family love of his father, Vito's great empire, one wholly based on love. Michael looses touch with reality and loses control, he sees everything which is real break right in front of him. An epic film with truly great actors. I think in the scene with Michael and all his brothers near the end shows how he, even back before he was tarnished with greed, wasn't a family orientated man. He wanted to live for himself, be successful on his own accord. Join the Marines. He never had plans to become part of the mafia. The reward of power and greed became too much until it suffocated him.

    This movie is three hours and twenty two minutes long but an hour passes like 15 minutes.It is incredibly entertaining and one of the best gangster movie ever made. The plot is tricky featuring two parallel story lines,one of young Vito Corleone fighting with life's dark events,providing for his family,building a Don status and seeking revenge for the killing of his family while other depicts the Michael Corleone and his falling empire,family and life. Al Pacino is stand out in the movie cast.You just see the expressions and his eyes it can tell you the whole story. He has completely transformed to a ruthless,heartless and cold gangster but never stopped loving his family. The scene where Kay(Diane Keaton) tells him about that she aborted their child,Al is flawless and most realistic how his eyes pops out and how he knocks her down.He deserved the Oscar for best actor. Robert De Niro is impeccable.What do you expect when two of the greatest actors play two of the greatest characters. De Niro portrays the character with similar talent as Marlon Brando did. The way he speaks with same husky voice also his sicilian. His principles,taking care of things,returning the favor and rise to mafia is just marvelous. The best scenes are where he follows Fannuci at Festa to his house and kills him other one ,obviously where he stabs Don Ciccio and says "My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you" is just brilliant. Diane Keaton portrays her character with utter excellence. Robert Duvall is as great as he was in the previous movie,the sophisticated lawyer ,caring brother and a good man. John Cazale character is bigger in this one and he is first class in the scene where he yells his heart out and in the whole movie. Michael Vincente Gazzo's performance is most realistic. The screenplay,style and violence is top notch. Again.Coppola's direction is mesmerizing. Overall,this is one of the best movie and not to be missed.
