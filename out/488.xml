 <sinopse>
  A hack screenwriter writes a screenplay for a former silent-film star who has faded into Hollywood obscurity.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The story, set in '50s Hollywood, focuses on Norma Desmond, a silent-screen goddess whose pathetic belief in her own indestructibility has turned her into a demented recluse. The crumbling Sunset Boulevard mansion where she lives with only her butler, Max who was once her director and husband has become her self-contained world. Norma dreams of a comeback to pictures and she begins a relationship with Joe Gillis, a small-time writer who becomes her lover, that will soon end with murder and total madness.

    Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career. This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.

    The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.

    Sunset Blvd. is an absolute masterpiece. From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was. It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.

    One of the best ever films about Hollywood and the double-edged sword life in the old Hollywood Studio system. Billy Wilder Directs amazing performances from Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded Silent Film star deludingly trying to reclaim her glorious past and William Holden as Joe Gillis, an indebted 'Boy wonder' Screenwriter who is running from the law when he accidentally finds refuge at the former Silent Film star's Hollywood mansion. Also an uncanny, excellent performance from real life legendary film maker Eric Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's loyal serving and empathetic butler for many years. The film does an absolutely brilliant job of showing both the glamorous and tragic sides of the heyday of classic era Hollywood.

    Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a "kept man". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment. Don't let the sunsets keep coming very many times before you sit down to watch it.

    Tried to watch it again last night with the same result. I just simply don't care about either Norma Desmond or Joe Gillie. Gloria Swanson is just too hideous to look at . All that clenched teeth, bugged out eyes,and spider like movements. It's a great performance I suppose, but not one that in any way gains sympathy.If anything she's repulsive. Holden is Holden. If you like him you probably like the movie. I'm not a Holden fan but I thought the film would be great in spite of him. Like for example Bridge on the River Kwai. However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath. Holden's narrator continually interrupts to tell us what is going on. All in all Sunset Blvd. is one classic that doesn't hold up.

    A satirical conflict between the two eras of cinema, an observation of the best & worst the film industry has in store for everyone, and a remarkable study of one of the most idiosyncratic movie characters you'll ever see, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is a tribute, and at the same time, a criticism of Hollywood film industry. Starring Gloria Swanson in a career defining role of Norma Desmond, a silent queen whose stardom vanished ages ago but remains alive in her delusional mind & William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling writer narrating us the tale of his demise & how it's connected with Norma. Gloria Swanson's performance is simply terrific and she truly owned her character by playing it with absolute finesse, overshadowing almost every other great aspects of this film. Nicely directed & brilliantly written with many moments of sadness & wit glued together, Sunset Boulevard paints a remarkable portrait of a bygone actress living in a world of her own and is a highly entertaining movie about Hollywood that culminates to a much more tragic finish than expected and etches Norma Desmond's final shot into our mind to haunt us forever. A classic noir drama.

    Sunset Boulevard is like a job-shadow for youngsters with some interest or talent for screen writing, without having connections to people in the industry. It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood: work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added "industry humor". It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is. A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on "Old Hollywood" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something "new"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10 Grade: A

    Delicious film noir that EVERY movie buff should see or own! Wonderful camp acting and great sets and lighting tricks. One of my personal favorites!! Gloria Swanson is super creepy, yet tragic as she tells William Holden her tales of woe while falling in love (or is it infatuation) with him. She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him. Watch for a tour d France delicious romp into Hollywood history both woven into the story of tragedy, hope, and strange mystery. Watch for a great performance by Max, Nora Desmonds butler. This movie is a classic that has uncommon staying power even by todays standards. William Holden is fun and OH SO YOUNG!

    I believe this was pretty good for an old film. Personally, I am not too enchanted by "classics", but this one was good. I think the theme of the past aging and not being relevant anymore was a strong one in this film. Times change and if you become hung up on the past, you cannot progress to the present and future. I liked this theme in the movie. I also enjoyed the twist in that the main character was the one who was killed at the end of the movie. This was something that I didn't think was coming, as he was narrating in the beginning of the movie. Having seen many movies from many eras, I haven't seen something like this, and thus was unable to accurately predict the ending like I usually do.

And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.

    One of the best ever films about Hollywood and the double-edged sword life in the old Hollywood Studio system. Billy Wilder Directs amazing performances from Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded Silent Film star deludingly trying to reclaim her glorious past and William Holden as Joe Gillis, an indebted 'Boy wonder' Screenwriter who is running from the law when he accidentally finds refuge at the former Silent Film star's Hollywood mansion. Also an uncanny, excellent performance from real life legendary film maker Eric Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's loyal serving and empathetic butler for many years. The film does an absolutely brilliant job of showing both the glamorous and tragic sides of the heyday of classic era Hollywood.

    Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a "kept man". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment. Don't let the sunsets keep coming very many times before you sit down to watch it.

    Tried to watch it again last night with the same result. I just simply don't care about either Norma Desmond or Joe Gillie. Gloria Swanson is just too hideous to look at . All that clenched teeth, bugged out eyes,and spider like movements. It's a great performance I suppose, but not one that in any way gains sympathy.If anything she's repulsive. Holden is Holden. If you like him you probably like the movie. I'm not a Holden fan but I thought the film would be great in spite of him. Like for example Bridge on the River Kwai. However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath. Holden's narrator continually interrupts to tell us what is going on. All in all Sunset Blvd. is one classic that doesn't hold up.

    A satirical conflict between the two eras of cinema, an observation of the best & worst the film industry has in store for everyone, and a remarkable study of one of the most idiosyncratic movie characters you'll ever see, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is a tribute, and at the same time, a criticism of Hollywood film industry. Starring Gloria Swanson in a career defining role of Norma Desmond, a silent queen whose stardom vanished ages ago but remains alive in her delusional mind & William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling writer narrating us the tale of his demise & how it's connected with Norma. Gloria Swanson's performance is simply terrific and she truly owned her character by playing it with absolute finesse, overshadowing almost every other great aspects of this film. Nicely directed & brilliantly written with many moments of sadness & wit glued together, Sunset Boulevard paints a remarkable portrait of a bygone actress living in a world of her own and is a highly entertaining movie about Hollywood that culminates to a much more tragic finish than expected and etches Norma Desmond's final shot into our mind to haunt us forever. A classic noir drama.

    Sunset Boulevard is like a job-shadow for youngsters with some interest or talent for screen writing, without having connections to people in the industry. It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood: work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added "industry humor". It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is. A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on "Old Hollywood" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something "new"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10 Grade: A

    Delicious film noir that EVERY movie buff should see or own! Wonderful camp acting and great sets and lighting tricks. One of my personal favorites!! Gloria Swanson is super creepy, yet tragic as she tells William Holden her tales of woe while falling in love (or is it infatuation) with him. She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him. Watch for a tour d France delicious romp into Hollywood history both woven into the story of tragedy, hope, and strange mystery. Watch for a great performance by Max, Nora Desmonds butler. This movie is a classic that has uncommon staying power even by todays standards. William Holden is fun and OH SO YOUNG!

    I believe this was pretty good for an old film. Personally, I am not too enchanted by "classics", but this one was good. I think the theme of the past aging and not being relevant anymore was a strong one in this film. Times change and if you become hung up on the past, you cannot progress to the present and future. I liked this theme in the movie. I also enjoyed the twist in that the main character was the one who was killed at the end of the movie. This was something that I didn't think was coming, as he was narrating in the beginning of the movie. Having seen many movies from many eras, I haven't seen something like this, and thus was unable to accurately predict the ending like I usually do.

    Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career. This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.

    The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.

My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue.

    Delicious film noir that EVERY movie buff should see or own! Wonderful camp acting and great sets and lighting tricks. One of my personal favorites!! Gloria Swanson is super creepy, yet tragic as she tells William Holden her tales of woe while falling in love (or is it infatuation) with him. She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him. Watch for a tour d France delicious romp into Hollywood history both woven into the story of tragedy, hope, and strange mystery. Watch for a great performance by Max, Nora Desmonds butler. This movie is a classic that has uncommon staying power even by todays standards. William Holden is fun and OH SO YOUNG!

    I believe this was pretty good for an old film. Personally, I am not too enchanted by "classics", but this one was good. I think the theme of the past aging and not being relevant anymore was a strong one in this film. Times change and if you become hung up on the past, you cannot progress to the present and future. I liked this theme in the movie. I also enjoyed the twist in that the main character was the one who was killed at the end of the movie. This was something that I didn't think was coming, as he was narrating in the beginning of the movie. Having seen many movies from many eras, I haven't seen something like this, and thus was unable to accurately predict the ending like I usually do.

    Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career. This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.

    The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.

    Sunset Blvd. is an absolute masterpiece. From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was. It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.

    One of the best ever films about Hollywood and the double-edged sword life in the old Hollywood Studio system. Billy Wilder Directs amazing performances from Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded Silent Film star deludingly trying to reclaim her glorious past and William Holden as Joe Gillis, an indebted 'Boy wonder' Screenwriter who is running from the law when he accidentally finds refuge at the former Silent Film star's Hollywood mansion. Also an uncanny, excellent performance from real life legendary film maker Eric Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's loyal serving and empathetic butler for many years. The film does an absolutely brilliant job of showing both the glamorous and tragic sides of the heyday of classic era Hollywood.

    Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a "kept man". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment. Don't let the sunsets keep coming very many times before you sit down to watch it.

    Tried to watch it again last night with the same result. I just simply don't care about either Norma Desmond or Joe Gillie. Gloria Swanson is just too hideous to look at . All that clenched teeth, bugged out eyes,and spider like movements. It's a great performance I suppose, but not one that in any way gains sympathy.If anything she's repulsive. Holden is Holden. If you like him you probably like the movie. I'm not a Holden fan but I thought the film would be great in spite of him. Like for example Bridge on the River Kwai. However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath. Holden's narrator continually interrupts to tell us what is going on. All in all Sunset Blvd. is one classic that doesn't hold up.

    A satirical conflict between the two eras of cinema, an observation of the best & worst the film industry has in store for everyone, and a remarkable study of one of the most idiosyncratic movie characters you'll ever see, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is a tribute, and at the same time, a criticism of Hollywood film industry. Starring Gloria Swanson in a career defining role of Norma Desmond, a silent queen whose stardom vanished ages ago but remains alive in her delusional mind & William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling writer narrating us the tale of his demise & how it's connected with Norma. Gloria Swanson's performance is simply terrific and she truly owned her character by playing it with absolute finesse, overshadowing almost every other great aspects of this film. Nicely directed & brilliantly written with many moments of sadness & wit glued together, Sunset Boulevard paints a remarkable portrait of a bygone actress living in a world of her own and is a highly entertaining movie about Hollywood that culminates to a much more tragic finish than expected and etches Norma Desmond's final shot into our mind to haunt us forever. A classic noir drama.

    Sunset Boulevard is like a job-shadow for youngsters with some interest or talent for screen writing, without having connections to people in the industry. It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood: work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added "industry humor". It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is. A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on "Old Hollywood" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something "new"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10 Grade: A

    Sunset Blvd. is an absolute masterpiece. From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was. It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.

    One of the best ever films about Hollywood and the double-edged sword life in the old Hollywood Studio system. Billy Wilder Directs amazing performances from Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded Silent Film star deludingly trying to reclaim her glorious past and William Holden as Joe Gillis, an indebted 'Boy wonder' Screenwriter who is running from the law when he accidentally finds refuge at the former Silent Film star's Hollywood mansion. Also an uncanny, excellent performance from real life legendary film maker Eric Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's loyal serving and empathetic butler for many years. The film does an absolutely brilliant job of showing both the glamorous and tragic sides of the heyday of classic era Hollywood.

    Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a "kept man". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment. Don't let the sunsets keep coming very many times before you sit down to watch it.

    Tried to watch it again last night with the same result. I just simply don't care about either Norma Desmond or Joe Gillie. Gloria Swanson is just too hideous to look at . All that clenched teeth, bugged out eyes,and spider like movements. It's a great performance I suppose, but not one that in any way gains sympathy.If anything she's repulsive. Holden is Holden. If you like him you probably like the movie. I'm not a Holden fan but I thought the film would be great in spite of him. Like for example Bridge on the River Kwai. However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath. Holden's narrator continually interrupts to tell us what is going on. All in all Sunset Blvd. is one classic that doesn't hold up.

    A satirical conflict between the two eras of cinema, an observation of the best & worst the film industry has in store for everyone, and a remarkable study of one of the most idiosyncratic movie characters you'll ever see, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is a tribute, and at the same time, a criticism of Hollywood film industry. Starring Gloria Swanson in a career defining role of Norma Desmond, a silent queen whose stardom vanished ages ago but remains alive in her delusional mind & William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling writer narrating us the tale of his demise & how it's connected with Norma. Gloria Swanson's performance is simply terrific and she truly owned her character by playing it with absolute finesse, overshadowing almost every other great aspects of this film. Nicely directed & brilliantly written with many moments of sadness & wit glued together, Sunset Boulevard paints a remarkable portrait of a bygone actress living in a world of her own and is a highly entertaining movie about Hollywood that culminates to a much more tragic finish than expected and etches Norma Desmond's final shot into our mind to haunt us forever. A classic noir drama.

    Sunset Boulevard is like a job-shadow for youngsters with some interest or talent for screen writing, without having connections to people in the industry. It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood: work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added "industry humor". It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is. A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on "Old Hollywood" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something "new"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10 Grade: A

    Delicious film noir that EVERY movie buff should see or own! Wonderful camp acting and great sets and lighting tricks. One of my personal favorites!! Gloria Swanson is super creepy, yet tragic as she tells William Holden her tales of woe while falling in love (or is it infatuation) with him. She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him. Watch for a tour d France delicious romp into Hollywood history both woven into the story of tragedy, hope, and strange mystery. Watch for a great performance by Max, Nora Desmonds butler. This movie is a classic that has uncommon staying power even by todays standards. William Holden is fun and OH SO YOUNG!

    I believe this was pretty good for an old film. Personally, I am not too enchanted by "classics", but this one was good. I think the theme of the past aging and not being relevant anymore was a strong one in this film. Times change and if you become hung up on the past, you cannot progress to the present and future. I liked this theme in the movie. I also enjoyed the twist in that the main character was the one who was killed at the end of the movie. This was something that I didn't think was coming, as he was narrating in the beginning of the movie. Having seen many movies from many eras, I haven't seen something like this, and thus was unable to accurately predict the ending like I usually do.

    Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career. This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.

    The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.

In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on "Old Hollywood" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something "new"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10 Grade: A

    Delicious film noir that EVERY movie buff should see or own! Wonderful camp acting and great sets and lighting tricks. One of my personal favorites!! Gloria Swanson is super creepy, yet tragic as she tells William Holden her tales of woe while falling in love (or is it infatuation) with him. She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him. Watch for a tour d France delicious romp into Hollywood history both woven into the story of tragedy, hope, and strange mystery. Watch for a great performance by Max, Nora Desmonds butler. This movie is a classic that has uncommon staying power even by todays standards. William Holden is fun and OH SO YOUNG!

    I believe this was pretty good for an old film. Personally, I am not too enchanted by "classics", but this one was good. I think the theme of the past aging and not being relevant anymore was a strong one in this film. Times change and if you become hung up on the past, you cannot progress to the present and future. I liked this theme in the movie. I also enjoyed the twist in that the main character was the one who was killed at the end of the movie. This was something that I didn't think was coming, as he was narrating in the beginning of the movie. Having seen many movies from many eras, I haven't seen something like this, and thus was unable to accurately predict the ending like I usually do.

    Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career. This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.

    The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.

    Sunset Blvd. is an absolute masterpiece. From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was. It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.

    One of the best ever films about Hollywood and the double-edged sword life in the old Hollywood Studio system. Billy Wilder Directs amazing performances from Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded Silent Film star deludingly trying to reclaim her glorious past and William Holden as Joe Gillis, an indebted 'Boy wonder' Screenwriter who is running from the law when he accidentally finds refuge at the former Silent Film star's Hollywood mansion. Also an uncanny, excellent performance from real life legendary film maker Eric Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's loyal serving and empathetic butler for many years. The film does an absolutely brilliant job of showing both the glamorous and tragic sides of the heyday of classic era Hollywood.

    Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a "kept man". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment. Don't let the sunsets keep coming very many times before you sit down to watch it.

    Tried to watch it again last night with the same result. I just simply don't care about either Norma Desmond or Joe Gillie. Gloria Swanson is just too hideous to look at . All that clenched teeth, bugged out eyes,and spider like movements. It's a great performance I suppose, but not one that in any way gains sympathy.If anything she's repulsive. Holden is Holden. If you like him you probably like the movie. I'm not a Holden fan but I thought the film would be great in spite of him. Like for example Bridge on the River Kwai. However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath. Holden's narrator continually interrupts to tell us what is going on. All in all Sunset Blvd. is one classic that doesn't hold up.

    A satirical conflict between the two eras of cinema, an observation of the best & worst the film industry has in store for everyone, and a remarkable study of one of the most idiosyncratic movie characters you'll ever see, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is a tribute, and at the same time, a criticism of Hollywood film industry. Starring Gloria Swanson in a career defining role of Norma Desmond, a silent queen whose stardom vanished ages ago but remains alive in her delusional mind & William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling writer narrating us the tale of his demise & how it's connected with Norma. Gloria Swanson's performance is simply terrific and she truly owned her character by playing it with absolute finesse, overshadowing almost every other great aspects of this film. Nicely directed & brilliantly written with many moments of sadness & wit glued together, Sunset Boulevard paints a remarkable portrait of a bygone actress living in a world of her own and is a highly entertaining movie about Hollywood that culminates to a much more tragic finish than expected and etches Norma Desmond's final shot into our mind to haunt us forever. A classic noir drama.

    Sunset Boulevard is like a job-shadow for youngsters with some interest or talent for screen writing, without having connections to people in the industry. It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood: work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added "industry humor". It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is. A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on "Old Hollywood" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something "new"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10 Grade: A

The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.

    Sunset Blvd. is an absolute masterpiece. From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was. It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.

    One of the best ever films about Hollywood and the double-edged sword life in the old Hollywood Studio system. Billy Wilder Directs amazing performances from Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded Silent Film star deludingly trying to reclaim her glorious past and William Holden as Joe Gillis, an indebted 'Boy wonder' Screenwriter who is running from the law when he accidentally finds refuge at the former Silent Film star's Hollywood mansion. Also an uncanny, excellent performance from real life legendary film maker Eric Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's loyal serving and empathetic butler for many years. The film does an absolutely brilliant job of showing both the glamorous and tragic sides of the heyday of classic era Hollywood.

    Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a "kept man". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment. Don't let the sunsets keep coming very many times before you sit down to watch it.

    Tried to watch it again last night with the same result. I just simply don't care about either Norma Desmond or Joe Gillie. Gloria Swanson is just too hideous to look at . All that clenched teeth, bugged out eyes,and spider like movements. It's a great performance I suppose, but not one that in any way gains sympathy.If anything she's repulsive. Holden is Holden. If you like him you probably like the movie. I'm not a Holden fan but I thought the film would be great in spite of him. Like for example Bridge on the River Kwai. However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath. Holden's narrator continually interrupts to tell us what is going on. All in all Sunset Blvd. is one classic that doesn't hold up.

    A satirical conflict between the two eras of cinema, an observation of the best & worst the film industry has in store for everyone, and a remarkable study of one of the most idiosyncratic movie characters you'll ever see, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is a tribute, and at the same time, a criticism of Hollywood film industry. Starring Gloria Swanson in a career defining role of Norma Desmond, a silent queen whose stardom vanished ages ago but remains alive in her delusional mind & William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling writer narrating us the tale of his demise & how it's connected with Norma. Gloria Swanson's performance is simply terrific and she truly owned her character by playing it with absolute finesse, overshadowing almost every other great aspects of this film. Nicely directed & brilliantly written with many moments of sadness & wit glued together, Sunset Boulevard paints a remarkable portrait of a bygone actress living in a world of her own and is a highly entertaining movie about Hollywood that culminates to a much more tragic finish than expected and etches Norma Desmond's final shot into our mind to haunt us forever. A classic noir drama.

    Sunset Boulevard is like a job-shadow for youngsters with some interest or talent for screen writing, without having connections to people in the industry. It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood: work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added "industry humor". It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is. A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on "Old Hollywood" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something "new"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10 Grade: A

    Delicious film noir that EVERY movie buff should see or own! Wonderful camp acting and great sets and lighting tricks. One of my personal favorites!! Gloria Swanson is super creepy, yet tragic as she tells William Holden her tales of woe while falling in love (or is it infatuation) with him. She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him. Watch for a tour d France delicious romp into Hollywood history both woven into the story of tragedy, hope, and strange mystery. Watch for a great performance by Max, Nora Desmonds butler. This movie is a classic that has uncommon staying power even by todays standards. William Holden is fun and OH SO YOUNG!

    I believe this was pretty good for an old film. Personally, I am not too enchanted by "classics", but this one was good. I think the theme of the past aging and not being relevant anymore was a strong one in this film. Times change and if you become hung up on the past, you cannot progress to the present and future. I liked this theme in the movie. I also enjoyed the twist in that the main character was the one who was killed at the end of the movie. This was something that I didn't think was coming, as he was narrating in the beginning of the movie. Having seen many movies from many eras, I haven't seen something like this, and thus was unable to accurately predict the ending like I usually do.

    Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career. This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.

    The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.

The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on "Old Hollywood" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something "new"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10 Grade: A

    Delicious film noir that EVERY movie buff should see or own! Wonderful camp acting and great sets and lighting tricks. One of my personal favorites!! Gloria Swanson is super creepy, yet tragic as she tells William Holden her tales of woe while falling in love (or is it infatuation) with him. She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him. Watch for a tour d France delicious romp into Hollywood history both woven into the story of tragedy, hope, and strange mystery. Watch for a great performance by Max, Nora Desmonds butler. This movie is a classic that has uncommon staying power even by todays standards. William Holden is fun and OH SO YOUNG!

    I believe this was pretty good for an old film. Personally, I am not too enchanted by "classics", but this one was good. I think the theme of the past aging and not being relevant anymore was a strong one in this film. Times change and if you become hung up on the past, you cannot progress to the present and future. I liked this theme in the movie. I also enjoyed the twist in that the main character was the one who was killed at the end of the movie. This was something that I didn't think was coming, as he was narrating in the beginning of the movie. Having seen many movies from many eras, I haven't seen something like this, and thus was unable to accurately predict the ending like I usually do.

    Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career. This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.

    The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.

    Sunset Blvd. is an absolute masterpiece. From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was. It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.

    One of the best ever films about Hollywood and the double-edged sword life in the old Hollywood Studio system. Billy Wilder Directs amazing performances from Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded Silent Film star deludingly trying to reclaim her glorious past and William Holden as Joe Gillis, an indebted 'Boy wonder' Screenwriter who is running from the law when he accidentally finds refuge at the former Silent Film star's Hollywood mansion. Also an uncanny, excellent performance from real life legendary film maker Eric Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's loyal serving and empathetic butler for many years. The film does an absolutely brilliant job of showing both the glamorous and tragic sides of the heyday of classic era Hollywood.

    Joe Gillis (William Holden) moved to Hollywood from Ohio in hopes of becoming a successful screenwriter. But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a "kept man". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment. Don't let the sunsets keep coming very many times before you sit down to watch it.

    Tried to watch it again last night with the same result. I just simply don't care about either Norma Desmond or Joe Gillie. Gloria Swanson is just too hideous to look at . All that clenched teeth, bugged out eyes,and spider like movements. It's a great performance I suppose, but not one that in any way gains sympathy.If anything she's repulsive. Holden is Holden. If you like him you probably like the movie. I'm not a Holden fan but I thought the film would be great in spite of him. Like for example Bridge on the River Kwai. However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath. Holden's narrator continually interrupts to tell us what is going on. All in all Sunset Blvd. is one classic that doesn't hold up.

    A satirical conflict between the two eras of cinema, an observation of the best & worst the film industry has in store for everyone, and a remarkable study of one of the most idiosyncratic movie characters you'll ever see, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is a tribute, and at the same time, a criticism of Hollywood film industry. Starring Gloria Swanson in a career defining role of Norma Desmond, a silent queen whose stardom vanished ages ago but remains alive in her delusional mind & William Holden as Joe Gillis, a struggling writer narrating us the tale of his demise & how it's connected with Norma. Gloria Swanson's performance is simply terrific and she truly owned her character by playing it with absolute finesse, overshadowing almost every other great aspects of this film. Nicely directed & brilliantly written with many moments of sadness & wit glued together, Sunset Boulevard paints a remarkable portrait of a bygone actress living in a world of her own and is a highly entertaining movie about Hollywood that culminates to a much more tragic finish than expected and etches Norma Desmond's final shot into our mind to haunt us forever. A classic noir drama.

    Sunset Boulevard is like a job-shadow for youngsters with some interest or talent for screen writing, without having connections to people in the industry. It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood: work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added "industry humor". It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is. A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion.
