 <sinopse>
  A visiting city reporter's assignment suddenly revolves around the murder trial of a local millionaire, whom he befriends.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This panoramic tale of Savannah's eccentricities focuses on a murder and the subsequent trial of Jim Williams: self made man, art collector, antiques dealer, bon vivant and semi-closeted homosexual. John Kelso a magazine reporter finds himself in Savannah amid the beautiful architecture and odd doings to write a feature on one of William's famous Christmas parties. He is intrigued by Williams from the start, but his curiosity is piqued when he meets Jim's violent, young and sexy lover, Billy. Later that night, Billy is dead, and Kelso stays on to cover the murder trial. Along the way he encounters the irrepressible Lady Chablis, a drag queen commedienne, Sonny Seiler, lawyer to Williams, whose famous dog UGA is the official mascot of the Georgia Bulldogs, an odd man who keeps flies attached to mini leashes on his lapels and threatens daily to poison the water supply, the Married Ladies Card Club, and Minerva, a spiritualist. Between being Jim's buddy, cuddling up to a torch singer, ...

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (or code name: MITGOGAE  damn, even that acronym is too long) was one of those movies I wanted to like more, but still did a lot. It's an enormously interesting story with fantastic characters and it was one of those films that restored (some) of my faith in John Cusack. This movie should be noteworthy for several interesting characters, such as Cusack's John Kelso and definitely, Kevin Spacey's flamboyant Jim Williams. But, overall, the winner goes to The Lady Chablis. She was amazing. And her interactions between her and John were key to the film's success for me. Okay, not just those scenes, but certainly a huge highlight whenever I revisit this film. Another great aspect of MITGOGAE was the setting and cinematography. The John Kelso character is out of his element in this Deep South surrounding and you'd be lying if you don't get swooped up right along with him, exploring on your own the differences from your world and this one. I get just as mesmerized as he is with all that this film sets up in regards to characters, landscaping, the houses and, heck, even the town is a character. Further, the story, a film noir mystery with multiples of twists, is as exciting to us as the onion peals back as it is to John Kelso. It's a murder mystery with intrigue and intelligence. Spacey and his character Jim Williams are both flipping interesting and exciting, it's absolutely a joy to watch him from scene to scene as he's caught up in this. Basically, writer John Kelso gets a freelance 500-word assignment he thinks he was randomly assigned to, to cover the annual extravagant Jim Williams' Christmas Party. Bummed it's not that big of an article, one-time novelist John Kelso begins his reporting when a "self-defense" murder takes place. Intrigued, John expands his investigation and thinks there's more to this story and this town than meets the eye. He's right. While not perfect and has its moments of slow-down and a totally sad ending to me  see it, and you'll know why I was bummed per my words above, it's a movie that draws me back to (the location of) Savannah time and again. If you're a fan of Cusack, Spacey and colorful backdrops, this is the movie for you. Give it a chance, and you might be a fan for life. "I've only been here three days and it's just a shooting, but give it time, okay. This place is fantastic. It's like Gone With the Wind on Mescalin. I know you're my agent. Listen to me, they walk imaginary pets here, Garland. On a fvcking leash. Alright? And they're all heavily armed and drunk. New York is boring!"  John Kelso.

    I do not understand why this movie gets low ratings like above.. I stumbled upon this gem a few weeks ago.. while browsing Clint 's work. This movie is undoubtedly one of my favs. The scenery is magic. The story is kinda weird and SEEMS somewhat boring.. hell no! Go & see! This is a movie who gets you to respect a lot of beautiful things about the American southern living, combined with a reserved style of acting. You will feel the dreamy pretty surroundings enter your mind.. The very reserved but glorifying act of mr. Spacey will get you to understand what acting is all about. He can do anything.. this guy is a genius. His accent is flawless... Cusack will do good as usual, staying with his regular next door guy but oh so relatable. But the flat ass shady lawyer (Aussie guy i believe) & Spacey will lift this movie with a mystery & vague feeling i have not ever seen before. It was one of those movies that was not a thrill to go and watch but on 'the watch' list for long, but i was wrong.. I should have seen it earlier. I loved it to pieces! If you care for top notch cast, mind blowing jazzy music, sweet & fairytale-scenery... kinda slow building & somewhat (double) funny & creepy vibe .. you have a golden night! Im not giving away any spoilers, but please see this! Its nothing like anything we know from the nowadays blockbusters. When i feel restless or not very happy .. i turn this on. Absolutely stunning filming Clint your awesome!

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is about a small town trial about a murder that pits hard evidence against the prejudice of a community. In the end, the jury acquits the accused, but the accused also reveals that he had actually lied about the murder. I have a hard time figuring out the point (and genre) of the story. All along, we are pulled along to root for a court room drama that seems on path to being about overcoming small town prejudice to free an innocent man. But then at the end the man's innocence is put in question. So the resolution feels weird. The town is also weird (which seems to be a part of the story). The community is a closeted bunch of fruitcakes ruled by gossip and prejudice. The movie paints a vivid picture of the community's weirdness, but how does that serve the point of the story? I don't get it. And the genre is a little weird. If its a courtroom drama, then hard evidence should rule the day. If it's about the ambiguous nature of good and evil and the hidden powers of fate and voodoo on our lives, then fate and consequence should rule the day. I don't think you can mix them. The court room drama and hard evidence is what takes up screen time and pulls our attention forward, but then the climax switches the focus to the good/evil ambiguity and the sense that you get what you deserve by divine retribution. So we go along for one ride (Courtroom Drama) and finish on a different ride at the end (Good/Evil Contemplation/Fate). Makes me feel weird about the ticket I purchased at the beginning. A specific example is: the photographer took pictures of the crime scene and handed it to our protagonist. In a Courtroom Drama these types of actions should have consequences later (maybe he develops the film to find a clue). But it didn't happen. So the Genre is busted. We devoted a good portion of attention in the first half of the movie being sensitive to these clues in the story, but there is no payoff. So in the end we feel we have been duped and wrongly invested. One star for wasting my time. I think the Genre ambiguity might arise from the fact that this is a book adaptation. In the book medium, we can get inside the heads of the characters and try to make moral sense of the external actions. But it might not have translated so well in a movie.

    Eastwood has proved himself as a filmmaker before--- but not here. This is a misfire. Sure, any movie has to have certain changes --- four trials distilled down into one, composite characters, even key manufactured roles thru which to "convey" the events to the audience--- but these were not the flaws in Eastwood's semi-botching of John Berendt's book. No, Clint just messed up the film on its own. And one gets the distinct feeling he optioned the movie rights to this as either a vanity project or because he liked Johnny Mercer's music. But not from a love of the subject matter. Much of the southern Gothic potential is squandered, the "sleepy" mood intended instead becomes mere glacial pacing, and there is an all-round bored feeling coming from the camera, from Mr. Eastwood... Yes, there is a good cast, but nothing is done with them... Even the scene on which the title is based, the voodoo ritual in the graveyard, is as flat and uninspired as it could be. Clint seemed to ALMOST have the right idea, as the picture opens with a drifting, sailing shot over the marshes, fading into that statue in the moss-drenched Bonaventure cemetery --- all set to KD Lang's haunting version of a Mercer tune.... But it's pretty much downhill from there.

    Lady Chablis absolutely upstaged the rest of a very interesting cast. After seeing it recently after a hiatus of six or so years, I was amazed to see so many memorable actors from so many films making subtle cameo appearances. It was To Kill a Mockingbird meets Planet of the Apes meets Every Which Way but Loose, a combination of Classic, Cult, and Strange but in a fun way that John Cusak exploits as the observer who is enjoying the strange duality of the characters that he meets without embracing them and yet finds himself becoming part of their lives. The courtroom scenes were surprisingly realistic despite the constant presence of bizarre characters...yet beneath the bizarre is a tolerant reality...two different worlds co-existing and only rarely jarring together. This is a very unusual film, very, very "different" and hard to pigeonhole. It is memorable if just for that. The duality of Spacey's dripping charm character with a contempt and loathing for the very things he covets creates a conflict that is interesting to watch. The ending of the film makes more sense to me now than it once did, perhaps this is the type of film that grows on you. Lady Chablis, you go girl.

    Overlong, over baked, bore fest from our most OVERRATED Director. Moves along at a simmering pace with languishing, laughable, stereotypes, and never allowed to boil. Unnecessary irritating details at every unbelievable step, that pose as polite Southern charm and come across as unbearable overplay. This is another indication of a Director that has been given undue accolades involving mediocre work throughout his career behind the camera. He worked with Don Siegel and Sergio Leone a number of times but learned nothing of their intense style and edgy work. There are good actors in this film that go unchallenged and there is good material that is layered with so much "make-up" that the whole film is a pretension of excessive attention from a Director that needs a pacemaker.

    I to am at a loss as to how people cannot like this movie. The audience around the television was smaller this time, just I, my wife and one daughter (13 yrs old) and we found the movie engaging, intricate, and involving - it has a deliberate pace, and perhaps, that is part of the a problem for some - it is not a whiz bang blow things up type of movie. Also, in the style of New Orleans, it has some odder characters appearing in the movie, and this undoubtedly is a turn-off for some. But the plot is skillfully woven, and grabs your attention at almost every turn. We generally found it riveting. John Cusack's performance was excellent, as was Kevin Spacey. The weakest link was Alison Eastwood, cast by her Dad, and really neither a good enough actor, or pretty enough for the role in which she was cast. But that was a small foible - you will have no regrets spending your 2 hrs watching this movie.

    "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" has a fairly inauspicious beginning for an Eastwood film, with journalist John Kelso (John Cusack) arriving in Savannah Georgia to document the Christmas party of local personality Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). Planted in the dense foliage of Georgia, a violent encounter soon sends Kelso on a trail of events to pry open the personal lives of these Cajun residents, and maybe even finding his story underneath it all. Whilst the film moves slow under its carefree southern veneer, the eccentric range of quirky characters, ranging from party-throwing squatters, a flirtatious transvestite, and best of all, a jive-talking voodoo practitioner, all provide entertaining and comedic encounters for Kelso. The film soon transitions to a courtroom drama that centers around the trial of millionaire Jim Williams, played by a moustachioed Kevin Spacey. He is able to pull of the accent convincingly, and that is all that is required in order for him to convince you as a southern artisocrat even as he spits out one-liners in supreme Spacey fashion. But there remains a hidden intention beneath his character's surface that he hints at all too well with the eyes. In fact, all the actors are in top form here, even a distracting Jude Law in a brief role. If it's anyone, it is John Cusack as the main character who perhaps leaves a bit more to be desired, along with his underdeveloped and tacked on love interest. Still, she is played well by Alison Eastwood, and together with Clint himself, they put together an atmospheric soundtrack that only adds to the immersion. Ill-paced and often confusing at times, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" is still a worthwhile romp into the secrets of America's southern edge... one that at times feels like another planet.

    John Kelso is a journalist sent by Town & Country magazine to eastern Georgia to cover a society party in Savannah thrown by Jim Williams, a prominent businessman. John is intrigued by the idiosyncrasies of the townsfolk but when Jim shoots and kills a young man later that night, he resolves to investigate the crime. This is the sort of well made, well acted, high quality movie I don't like. Its pedigree is too good - based on a highly acclaimed novel, made by an award-winning cast and crew, clocking in over 150 minutes and containing virtually no action. I guess there is an audience for such films, but it's not me. I'd drop most of the characters, halve the running time, put a car chase in the middle and have a shock twist at the end. Having said that, there is a lot to enjoy - all the performances are good, the best being Australian actor Thompson as Sonny, the good-natured but somewhat exasperated defence lawyer, and it's nice to see Eastwood's old buddy Lewis as the goofy head juror. The protagonist is interesting, as is often the case with stranger-in-a-strange land stories, and the voodoo priestess angle is amusing. In the end though, it's just much too long - the Lady Chablis drag act character has little connection to the case but has an hour of screen time - if I'd wanted to watch La Cage Aux Folles I would have just done so. Eastwood likes these people and their foibles, and is much more interested in exploring their lives than creating any kind of tension or suspense in what is primarily a crime story. Shot in beautiful locations in Savannah, and adapted from a bestselling novel by John Berendt, which was based on a real-life murder case.

This is another indication of a Director that has been given undue accolades involving mediocre work throughout his career behind the camera. He worked with Don Siegel and Sergio Leone a number of times but learned nothing of their intense style and edgy work. There are good actors in this film that go unchallenged and there is good material that is layered with so much "make-up" that the whole film is a pretension of excessive attention from a Director that needs a pacemaker.

    I to am at a loss as to how people cannot like this movie. The audience around the television was smaller this time, just I, my wife and one daughter (13 yrs old) and we found the movie engaging, intricate, and involving - it has a deliberate pace, and perhaps, that is part of the a problem for some - it is not a whiz bang blow things up type of movie. Also, in the style of New Orleans, it has some odder characters appearing in the movie, and this undoubtedly is a turn-off for some. But the plot is skillfully woven, and grabs your attention at almost every turn. We generally found it riveting. John Cusack's performance was excellent, as was Kevin Spacey. The weakest link was Alison Eastwood, cast by her Dad, and really neither a good enough actor, or pretty enough for the role in which she was cast. But that was a small foible - you will have no regrets spending your 2 hrs watching this movie.

    "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" has a fairly inauspicious beginning for an Eastwood film, with journalist John Kelso (John Cusack) arriving in Savannah Georgia to document the Christmas party of local personality Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). Planted in the dense foliage of Georgia, a violent encounter soon sends Kelso on a trail of events to pry open the personal lives of these Cajun residents, and maybe even finding his story underneath it all. Whilst the film moves slow under its carefree southern veneer, the eccentric range of quirky characters, ranging from party-throwing squatters, a flirtatious transvestite, and best of all, a jive-talking voodoo practitioner, all provide entertaining and comedic encounters for Kelso. The film soon transitions to a courtroom drama that centers around the trial of millionaire Jim Williams, played by a moustachioed Kevin Spacey. He is able to pull of the accent convincingly, and that is all that is required in order for him to convince you as a southern artisocrat even as he spits out one-liners in supreme Spacey fashion. But there remains a hidden intention beneath his character's surface that he hints at all too well with the eyes. In fact, all the actors are in top form here, even a distracting Jude Law in a brief role. If it's anyone, it is John Cusack as the main character who perhaps leaves a bit more to be desired, along with his underdeveloped and tacked on love interest. Still, she is played well by Alison Eastwood, and together with Clint himself, they put together an atmospheric soundtrack that only adds to the immersion. Ill-paced and often confusing at times, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" is still a worthwhile romp into the secrets of America's southern edge... one that at times feels like another planet.

    John Kelso is a journalist sent by Town & Country magazine to eastern Georgia to cover a society party in Savannah thrown by Jim Williams, a prominent businessman. John is intrigued by the idiosyncrasies of the townsfolk but when Jim shoots and kills a young man later that night, he resolves to investigate the crime. This is the sort of well made, well acted, high quality movie I don't like. Its pedigree is too good - based on a highly acclaimed novel, made by an award-winning cast and crew, clocking in over 150 minutes and containing virtually no action. I guess there is an audience for such films, but it's not me. I'd drop most of the characters, halve the running time, put a car chase in the middle and have a shock twist at the end. Having said that, there is a lot to enjoy - all the performances are good, the best being Australian actor Thompson as Sonny, the good-natured but somewhat exasperated defence lawyer, and it's nice to see Eastwood's old buddy Lewis as the goofy head juror. The protagonist is interesting, as is often the case with stranger-in-a-strange land stories, and the voodoo priestess angle is amusing. In the end though, it's just much too long - the Lady Chablis drag act character has little connection to the case but has an hour of screen time - if I'd wanted to watch La Cage Aux Folles I would have just done so. Eastwood likes these people and their foibles, and is much more interested in exploring their lives than creating any kind of tension or suspense in what is primarily a crime story. Shot in beautiful locations in Savannah, and adapted from a bestselling novel by John Berendt, which was based on a real-life murder case.

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (or code name: MITGOGAE  damn, even that acronym is too long) was one of those movies I wanted to like more, but still did a lot. It's an enormously interesting story with fantastic characters and it was one of those films that restored (some) of my faith in John Cusack. This movie should be noteworthy for several interesting characters, such as Cusack's John Kelso and definitely, Kevin Spacey's flamboyant Jim Williams. But, overall, the winner goes to The Lady Chablis. She was amazing. And her interactions between her and John were key to the film's success for me. Okay, not just those scenes, but certainly a huge highlight whenever I revisit this film. Another great aspect of MITGOGAE was the setting and cinematography. The John Kelso character is out of his element in this Deep South surrounding and you'd be lying if you don't get swooped up right along with him, exploring on your own the differences from your world and this one. I get just as mesmerized as he is with all that this film sets up in regards to characters, landscaping, the houses and, heck, even the town is a character. Further, the story, a film noir mystery with multiples of twists, is as exciting to us as the onion peals back as it is to John Kelso. It's a murder mystery with intrigue and intelligence. Spacey and his character Jim Williams are both flipping interesting and exciting, it's absolutely a joy to watch him from scene to scene as he's caught up in this. Basically, writer John Kelso gets a freelance 500-word assignment he thinks he was randomly assigned to, to cover the annual extravagant Jim Williams' Christmas Party. Bummed it's not that big of an article, one-time novelist John Kelso begins his reporting when a "self-defense" murder takes place. Intrigued, John expands his investigation and thinks there's more to this story and this town than meets the eye. He's right. While not perfect and has its moments of slow-down and a totally sad ending to me  see it, and you'll know why I was bummed per my words above, it's a movie that draws me back to (the location of) Savannah time and again. If you're a fan of Cusack, Spacey and colorful backdrops, this is the movie for you. Give it a chance, and you might be a fan for life. "I've only been here three days and it's just a shooting, but give it time, okay. This place is fantastic. It's like Gone With the Wind on Mescalin. I know you're my agent. Listen to me, they walk imaginary pets here, Garland. On a fvcking leash. Alright? And they're all heavily armed and drunk. New York is boring!"  John Kelso.

    I do not understand why this movie gets low ratings like above.. I stumbled upon this gem a few weeks ago.. while browsing Clint 's work. This movie is undoubtedly one of my favs. The scenery is magic. The story is kinda weird and SEEMS somewhat boring.. hell no! Go & see! This is a movie who gets you to respect a lot of beautiful things about the American southern living, combined with a reserved style of acting. You will feel the dreamy pretty surroundings enter your mind.. The very reserved but glorifying act of mr. Spacey will get you to understand what acting is all about. He can do anything.. this guy is a genius. His accent is flawless... Cusack will do good as usual, staying with his regular next door guy but oh so relatable. But the flat ass shady lawyer (Aussie guy i believe) & Spacey will lift this movie with a mystery & vague feeling i have not ever seen before. It was one of those movies that was not a thrill to go and watch but on 'the watch' list for long, but i was wrong.. I should have seen it earlier. I loved it to pieces! If you care for top notch cast, mind blowing jazzy music, sweet & fairytale-scenery... kinda slow building & somewhat (double) funny & creepy vibe .. you have a golden night! Im not giving away any spoilers, but please see this! Its nothing like anything we know from the nowadays blockbusters. When i feel restless or not very happy .. i turn this on. Absolutely stunning filming Clint your awesome!

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is about a small town trial about a murder that pits hard evidence against the prejudice of a community. In the end, the jury acquits the accused, but the accused also reveals that he had actually lied about the murder. I have a hard time figuring out the point (and genre) of the story. All along, we are pulled along to root for a court room drama that seems on path to being about overcoming small town prejudice to free an innocent man. But then at the end the man's innocence is put in question. So the resolution feels weird. The town is also weird (which seems to be a part of the story). The community is a closeted bunch of fruitcakes ruled by gossip and prejudice. The movie paints a vivid picture of the community's weirdness, but how does that serve the point of the story? I don't get it. And the genre is a little weird. If its a courtroom drama, then hard evidence should rule the day. If it's about the ambiguous nature of good and evil and the hidden powers of fate and voodoo on our lives, then fate and consequence should rule the day. I don't think you can mix them. The court room drama and hard evidence is what takes up screen time and pulls our attention forward, but then the climax switches the focus to the good/evil ambiguity and the sense that you get what you deserve by divine retribution. So we go along for one ride (Courtroom Drama) and finish on a different ride at the end (Good/Evil Contemplation/Fate). Makes me feel weird about the ticket I purchased at the beginning. A specific example is: the photographer took pictures of the crime scene and handed it to our protagonist. In a Courtroom Drama these types of actions should have consequences later (maybe he develops the film to find a clue). But it didn't happen. So the Genre is busted. We devoted a good portion of attention in the first half of the movie being sensitive to these clues in the story, but there is no payoff. So in the end we feel we have been duped and wrongly invested. One star for wasting my time. I think the Genre ambiguity might arise from the fact that this is a book adaptation. In the book medium, we can get inside the heads of the characters and try to make moral sense of the external actions. But it might not have translated so well in a movie.

    Eastwood has proved himself as a filmmaker before--- but not here. This is a misfire. Sure, any movie has to have certain changes --- four trials distilled down into one, composite characters, even key manufactured roles thru which to "convey" the events to the audience--- but these were not the flaws in Eastwood's semi-botching of John Berendt's book. No, Clint just messed up the film on its own. And one gets the distinct feeling he optioned the movie rights to this as either a vanity project or because he liked Johnny Mercer's music. But not from a love of the subject matter. Much of the southern Gothic potential is squandered, the "sleepy" mood intended instead becomes mere glacial pacing, and there is an all-round bored feeling coming from the camera, from Mr. Eastwood... Yes, there is a good cast, but nothing is done with them... Even the scene on which the title is based, the voodoo ritual in the graveyard, is as flat and uninspired as it could be. Clint seemed to ALMOST have the right idea, as the picture opens with a drifting, sailing shot over the marshes, fading into that statue in the moss-drenched Bonaventure cemetery --- all set to KD Lang's haunting version of a Mercer tune.... But it's pretty much downhill from there.

    Lady Chablis absolutely upstaged the rest of a very interesting cast. After seeing it recently after a hiatus of six or so years, I was amazed to see so many memorable actors from so many films making subtle cameo appearances. It was To Kill a Mockingbird meets Planet of the Apes meets Every Which Way but Loose, a combination of Classic, Cult, and Strange but in a fun way that John Cusak exploits as the observer who is enjoying the strange duality of the characters that he meets without embracing them and yet finds himself becoming part of their lives. The courtroom scenes were surprisingly realistic despite the constant presence of bizarre characters...yet beneath the bizarre is a tolerant reality...two different worlds co-existing and only rarely jarring together. This is a very unusual film, very, very "different" and hard to pigeonhole. It is memorable if just for that. The duality of Spacey's dripping charm character with a contempt and loathing for the very things he covets creates a conflict that is interesting to watch. The ending of the film makes more sense to me now than it once did, perhaps this is the type of film that grows on you. Lady Chablis, you go girl.

    Overlong, over baked, bore fest from our most OVERRATED Director. Moves along at a simmering pace with languishing, laughable, stereotypes, and never allowed to boil. Unnecessary irritating details at every unbelievable step, that pose as polite Southern charm and come across as unbearable overplay. This is another indication of a Director that has been given undue accolades involving mediocre work throughout his career behind the camera. He worked with Don Siegel and Sergio Leone a number of times but learned nothing of their intense style and edgy work. There are good actors in this film that go unchallenged and there is good material that is layered with so much "make-up" that the whole film is a pretension of excessive attention from a Director that needs a pacemaker.

    I to am at a loss as to how people cannot like this movie. The audience around the television was smaller this time, just I, my wife and one daughter (13 yrs old) and we found the movie engaging, intricate, and involving - it has a deliberate pace, and perhaps, that is part of the a problem for some - it is not a whiz bang blow things up type of movie. Also, in the style of New Orleans, it has some odder characters appearing in the movie, and this undoubtedly is a turn-off for some. But the plot is skillfully woven, and grabs your attention at almost every turn. We generally found it riveting. John Cusack's performance was excellent, as was Kevin Spacey. The weakest link was Alison Eastwood, cast by her Dad, and really neither a good enough actor, or pretty enough for the role in which she was cast.

Sure, any movie has to have certain changes --- four trials distilled down into one, composite characters, even key manufactured roles thru which to "convey" the events to the audience--- but these were not the flaws in Eastwood's semi-botching of John Berendt's book. No, Clint just messed up the film on its own. And one gets the distinct feeling he optioned the movie rights to this as either a vanity project or because he liked Johnny Mercer's music. But not from a love of the subject matter. Much of the southern Gothic potential is squandered, the "sleepy" mood intended instead becomes mere glacial pacing, and there is an all-round bored feeling coming from the camera, from Mr. Eastwood... Yes, there is a good cast, but nothing is done with them... Even the scene on which the title is based, the voodoo ritual in the graveyard, is as flat and uninspired as it could be. Clint seemed to ALMOST have the right idea, as the picture opens with a drifting, sailing shot over the marshes, fading into that statue in the moss-drenched Bonaventure cemetery --- all set to KD Lang's haunting version of a Mercer tune.... But it's pretty much downhill from there.

    Lady Chablis absolutely upstaged the rest of a very interesting cast. After seeing it recently after a hiatus of six or so years, I was amazed to see so many memorable actors from so many films making subtle cameo appearances. It was To Kill a Mockingbird meets Planet of the Apes meets Every Which Way but Loose, a combination of Classic, Cult, and Strange but in a fun way that John Cusak exploits as the observer who is enjoying the strange duality of the characters that he meets without embracing them and yet finds himself becoming part of their lives. The courtroom scenes were surprisingly realistic despite the constant presence of bizarre characters...yet beneath the bizarre is a tolerant reality...two different worlds co-existing and only rarely jarring together. This is a very unusual film, very, very "different" and hard to pigeonhole. It is memorable if just for that. The duality of Spacey's dripping charm character with a contempt and loathing for the very things he covets creates a conflict that is interesting to watch. The ending of the film makes more sense to me now than it once did, perhaps this is the type of film that grows on you. Lady Chablis, you go girl.

    Overlong, over baked, bore fest from our most OVERRATED Director. Moves along at a simmering pace with languishing, laughable, stereotypes, and never allowed to boil. Unnecessary irritating details at every unbelievable step, that pose as polite Southern charm and come across as unbearable overplay. This is another indication of a Director that has been given undue accolades involving mediocre work throughout his career behind the camera. He worked with Don Siegel and Sergio Leone a number of times but learned nothing of their intense style and edgy work. There are good actors in this film that go unchallenged and there is good material that is layered with so much "make-up" that the whole film is a pretension of excessive attention from a Director that needs a pacemaker.

    I to am at a loss as to how people cannot like this movie. The audience around the television was smaller this time, just I, my wife and one daughter (13 yrs old) and we found the movie engaging, intricate, and involving - it has a deliberate pace, and perhaps, that is part of the a problem for some - it is not a whiz bang blow things up type of movie. Also, in the style of New Orleans, it has some odder characters appearing in the movie, and this undoubtedly is a turn-off for some. But the plot is skillfully woven, and grabs your attention at almost every turn. We generally found it riveting. John Cusack's performance was excellent, as was Kevin Spacey. The weakest link was Alison Eastwood, cast by her Dad, and really neither a good enough actor, or pretty enough for the role in which she was cast. But that was a small foible - you will have no regrets spending your 2 hrs watching this movie.

    "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" has a fairly inauspicious beginning for an Eastwood film, with journalist John Kelso (John Cusack) arriving in Savannah Georgia to document the Christmas party of local personality Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). Planted in the dense foliage of Georgia, a violent encounter soon sends Kelso on a trail of events to pry open the personal lives of these Cajun residents, and maybe even finding his story underneath it all. Whilst the film moves slow under its carefree southern veneer, the eccentric range of quirky characters, ranging from party-throwing squatters, a flirtatious transvestite, and best of all, a jive-talking voodoo practitioner, all provide entertaining and comedic encounters for Kelso. The film soon transitions to a courtroom drama that centers around the trial of millionaire Jim Williams, played by a moustachioed Kevin Spacey. He is able to pull of the accent convincingly, and that is all that is required in order for him to convince you as a southern artisocrat even as he spits out one-liners in supreme Spacey fashion. But there remains a hidden intention beneath his character's surface that he hints at all too well with the eyes. In fact, all the actors are in top form here, even a distracting Jude Law in a brief role. If it's anyone, it is John Cusack as the main character who perhaps leaves a bit more to be desired, along with his underdeveloped and tacked on love interest. Still, she is played well by Alison Eastwood, and together with Clint himself, they put together an atmospheric soundtrack that only adds to the immersion. Ill-paced and often confusing at times, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" is still a worthwhile romp into the secrets of America's southern edge... one that at times feels like another planet.

    John Kelso is a journalist sent by Town & Country magazine to eastern Georgia to cover a society party in Savannah thrown by Jim Williams, a prominent businessman. John is intrigued by the idiosyncrasies of the townsfolk but when Jim shoots and kills a young man later that night, he resolves to investigate the crime. This is the sort of well made, well acted, high quality movie I don't like. Its pedigree is too good - based on a highly acclaimed novel, made by an award-winning cast and crew, clocking in over 150 minutes and containing virtually no action. I guess there is an audience for such films, but it's not me. I'd drop most of the characters, halve the running time, put a car chase in the middle and have a shock twist at the end. Having said that, there is a lot to enjoy - all the performances are good, the best being Australian actor Thompson as Sonny, the good-natured but somewhat exasperated defence lawyer, and it's nice to see Eastwood's old buddy Lewis as the goofy head juror. The protagonist is interesting, as is often the case with stranger-in-a-strange land stories, and the voodoo priestess angle is amusing. In the end though, it's just much too long - the Lady Chablis drag act character has little connection to the case but has an hour of screen time - if I'd wanted to watch La Cage Aux Folles I would have just done so. Eastwood likes these people and their foibles, and is much more interested in exploring their lives than creating any kind of tension or suspense in what is primarily a crime story. Shot in beautiful locations in Savannah, and adapted from a bestselling novel by John Berendt, which was based on a real-life murder case.

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (or code name: MITGOGAE  damn, even that acronym is too long) was one of those movies I wanted to like more, but still did a lot. It's an enormously interesting story with fantastic characters and it was one of those films that restored (some) of my faith in John Cusack. This movie should be noteworthy for several interesting characters, such as Cusack's John Kelso and definitely, Kevin Spacey's flamboyant Jim Williams. But, overall, the winner goes to The Lady Chablis. She was amazing. And her interactions between her and John were key to the film's success for me. Okay, not just those scenes, but certainly a huge highlight whenever I revisit this film. Another great aspect of MITGOGAE was the setting and cinematography. The John Kelso character is out of his element in this Deep South surrounding and you'd be lying if you don't get swooped up right along with him, exploring on your own the differences from your world and this one. I get just as mesmerized as he is with all that this film sets up in regards to characters, landscaping, the houses and, heck, even the town is a character. Further, the story, a film noir mystery with multiples of twists, is as exciting to us as the onion peals back as it is to John Kelso. It's a murder mystery with intrigue and intelligence. Spacey and his character Jim Williams are both flipping interesting and exciting, it's absolutely a joy to watch him from scene to scene as he's caught up in this. Basically, writer John Kelso gets a freelance 500-word assignment he thinks he was randomly assigned to, to cover the annual extravagant Jim Williams' Christmas Party. Bummed it's not that big of an article, one-time novelist John Kelso begins his reporting when a "self-defense" murder takes place. Intrigued, John expands his investigation and thinks there's more to this story and this town than meets the eye. He's right. While not perfect and has its moments of slow-down and a totally sad ending to me  see it, and you'll know why I was bummed per my words above, it's a movie that draws me back to (the location of) Savannah time and again. If you're a fan of Cusack, Spacey and colorful backdrops, this is the movie for you. Give it a chance, and you might be a fan for life. "I've only been here three days and it's just a shooting, but give it time, okay. This place is fantastic. It's like Gone With the Wind on Mescalin. I know you're my agent. Listen to me, they walk imaginary pets here, Garland. On a fvcking leash. Alright? And they're all heavily armed and drunk. New York is boring!"  John Kelso.

    I do not understand why this movie gets low ratings like above.. I stumbled upon this gem a few weeks ago.. while browsing Clint 's work. This movie is undoubtedly one of my favs. The scenery is magic. The story is kinda weird and SEEMS somewhat boring.. hell no! Go & see! This is a movie who gets you to respect a lot of beautiful things about the American southern living, combined with a reserved style of acting. You will feel the dreamy pretty surroundings enter your mind.. The very reserved but glorifying act of mr. Spacey will get you to understand what acting is all about. He can do anything.. this guy is a genius. His accent is flawless... Cusack will do good as usual, staying with his regular next door guy but oh so relatable. But the flat ass shady lawyer (Aussie guy i believe) & Spacey will lift this movie with a mystery & vague feeling i have not ever seen before. It was one of those movies that was not a thrill to go and watch but on 'the watch' list for long, but i was wrong.. I should have seen it earlier. I loved it to pieces! If you care for top notch cast, mind blowing jazzy music, sweet & fairytale-scenery... kinda slow building & somewhat (double) funny & creepy vibe .. you have a golden night! Im not giving away any spoilers, but please see this! Its nothing like anything we know from the nowadays blockbusters. When i feel restless or not very happy .. i turn this on. Absolutely stunning filming Clint your awesome!

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is about a small town trial about a murder that pits hard evidence against the prejudice of a community. In the end, the jury acquits the accused, but the accused also reveals that he had actually lied about the murder. I have a hard time figuring out the point (and genre) of the story. All along, we are pulled along to root for a court room drama that seems on path to being about overcoming small town prejudice to free an innocent man. But then at the end the man's innocence is put in question. So the resolution feels weird. The town is also weird (which seems to be a part of the story). The community is a closeted bunch of fruitcakes ruled by gossip and prejudice. The movie paints a vivid picture of the community's weirdness, but how does that serve the point of the story? I don't get it. And the genre is a little weird. If its a courtroom drama, then hard evidence should rule the day. If it's about the ambiguous nature of good and evil and the hidden powers of fate and voodoo on our lives, then fate and consequence should rule the day. I don't think you can mix them. The court room drama and hard evidence is what takes up screen time and pulls our attention forward, but then the climax switches the focus to the good/evil ambiguity and the sense that you get what you deserve by divine retribution. So we go along for one ride (Courtroom Drama) and finish on a different ride at the end (Good/Evil Contemplation/Fate). Makes me feel weird about the ticket I purchased at the beginning. A specific example is: the photographer took pictures of the crime scene and handed it to our protagonist. In a Courtroom Drama these types of actions should have consequences later (maybe he develops the film to find a clue). But it didn't happen. So the Genre is busted. We devoted a good portion of attention in the first half of the movie being sensitive to these clues in the story, but there is no payoff. So in the end we feel we have been duped and wrongly invested. One star for wasting my time. I think the Genre ambiguity might arise from the fact that this is a book adaptation. In the book medium, we can get inside the heads of the characters and try to make moral sense of the external actions. But it might not have translated so well in a movie. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    Eastwood has proved himself as a filmmaker before--- but not here. This is a misfire. Sure, any movie has to have certain changes --- four trials distilled down into one, composite characters, even key manufactured roles thru which to "convey" the events to the audience--- but these were not the flaws in Eastwood's semi-botching of John Berendt's book. No, Clint just messed up the film on its own. And one gets the distinct feeling he optioned the movie rights to this as either a vanity project or because he liked Johnny Mercer's music. But not from a love of the subject matter. Much of the southern Gothic potential is squandered, the "sleepy" mood intended instead becomes mere glacial pacing, and there is an all-round bored feeling coming from the camera, from Mr. Eastwood... Yes, there is a good cast, but nothing is done with them... Even the scene on which the title is based, the voodoo ritual in the graveyard, is as flat and uninspired as it could be. Clint seemed to ALMOST have the right idea, as the picture opens with a drifting, sailing shot over the marshes, fading into that statue in the moss-drenched Bonaventure cemetery --- all set to KD Lang's haunting version of a Mercer tune.... But it's pretty much downhill from there.

    Lady Chablis absolutely upstaged the rest of a very interesting cast. After seeing it recently after a hiatus of six or so years, I was amazed to see so many memorable actors from so many films making subtle cameo appearances. It was To Kill a Mockingbird meets Planet of the Apes meets Every Which Way but Loose, a combination of Classic, Cult, and Strange but in a fun way that John Cusak exploits as the observer who is enjoying the strange duality of the characters that he meets without embracing them and yet finds himself becoming part of their lives. The courtroom scenes were surprisingly realistic despite the constant presence of bizarre characters...yet beneath the bizarre is a tolerant reality...two different worlds co-existing and only rarely jarring together. This is a very unusual film, very, very "different" and hard to pigeonhole. It is memorable if just for that. The duality of Spacey's dripping charm character with a contempt and loathing for the very things he covets creates a conflict that is interesting to watch. The ending of the film makes more sense to me now than it once did, perhaps this is the type of film that grows on you. Lady Chablis, you go girl.

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is about a small town trial about a murder that pits hard evidence against the prejudice of a community. In the end, the jury acquits the accused, but the accused also reveals that he had actually lied about the murder. I have a hard time figuring out the point (and genre) of the story. All along, we are pulled along to root for a court room drama that seems on path to being about overcoming small town prejudice to free an innocent man. But then at the end the man's innocence is put in question. So the resolution feels weird. The town is also weird (which seems to be a part of the story). The community is a closeted bunch of fruitcakes ruled by gossip and prejudice. The movie paints a vivid picture of the community's weirdness, but how does that serve the point of the story? I don't get it. And the genre is a little weird. If its a courtroom drama, then hard evidence should rule the day. If it's about the ambiguous nature of good and evil and the hidden powers of fate and voodoo on our lives, then fate and consequence should rule the day. I don't think you can mix them. The court room drama and hard evidence is what takes up screen time and pulls our attention forward, but then the climax switches the focus to the good/evil ambiguity and the sense that you get what you deserve by divine retribution. So we go along for one ride (Courtroom Drama) and finish on a different ride at the end (Good/Evil Contemplation/Fate). Makes me feel weird about the ticket I purchased at the beginning. A specific example is: the photographer took pictures of the crime scene and handed it to our protagonist. In a Courtroom Drama these types of actions should have consequences later (maybe he develops the film to find a clue). But it didn't happen. So the Genre is busted. We devoted a good portion of attention in the first half of the movie being sensitive to these clues in the story, but there is no payoff. So in the end we feel we have been duped and wrongly invested. One star for wasting my time. I think the Genre ambiguity might arise from the fact that this is a book adaptation. In the book medium, we can get inside the heads of the characters and try to make moral sense of the external actions. But it might not have translated so well in a movie.

    Eastwood has proved himself as a filmmaker before--- but not here. This is a misfire. Sure, any movie has to have certain changes --- four trials distilled down into one, composite characters, even key manufactured roles thru which to "convey" the events to the audience--- but these were not the flaws in Eastwood's semi-botching of John Berendt's book. No, Clint just messed up the film on its own. And one gets the distinct feeling he optioned the movie rights to this as either a vanity project or because he liked Johnny Mercer's music. But not from a love of the subject matter. Much of the southern Gothic potential is squandered, the "sleepy" mood intended instead becomes mere glacial pacing, and there is an all-round bored feeling coming from the camera, from Mr. Eastwood... Yes, there is a good cast, but nothing is done with them... Even the scene on which the title is based, the voodoo ritual in the graveyard, is as flat and uninspired as it could be. Clint seemed to ALMOST have the right idea, as the picture opens with a drifting, sailing shot over the marshes, fading into that statue in the moss-drenched Bonaventure cemetery --- all set to KD Lang's haunting version of a Mercer tune.... But it's pretty much downhill from there.

    Lady Chablis absolutely upstaged the rest of a very interesting cast. After seeing it recently after a hiatus of six or so years, I was amazed to see so many memorable actors from so many films making subtle cameo appearances. It was To Kill a Mockingbird meets Planet of the Apes meets Every Which Way but Loose, a combination of Classic, Cult, and Strange but in a fun way that John Cusak exploits as the observer who is enjoying the strange duality of the characters that he meets without embracing them and yet finds himself becoming part of their lives. The courtroom scenes were surprisingly realistic despite the constant presence of bizarre characters...yet beneath the bizarre is a tolerant reality...two different worlds co-existing and only rarely jarring together. This is a very unusual film, very, very "different" and hard to pigeonhole. It is memorable if just for that. The duality of Spacey's dripping charm character with a contempt and loathing for the very things he covets creates a conflict that is interesting to watch. The ending of the film makes more sense to me now than it once did, perhaps this is the type of film that grows on you. Lady Chablis, you go girl.

    Overlong, over baked, bore fest from our most OVERRATED Director. Moves along at a simmering pace with languishing, laughable, stereotypes, and never allowed to boil. Unnecessary irritating details at every unbelievable step, that pose as polite Southern charm and come across as unbearable overplay. This is another indication of a Director that has been given undue accolades involving mediocre work throughout his career behind the camera. He worked with Don Siegel and Sergio Leone a number of times but learned nothing of their intense style and edgy work. There are good actors in this film that go unchallenged and there is good material that is layered with so much "make-up" that the whole film is a pretension of excessive attention from a Director that needs a pacemaker.

    I to am at a loss as to how people cannot like this movie. The audience around the television was smaller this time, just I, my wife and one daughter (13 yrs old) and we found the movie engaging, intricate, and involving - it has a deliberate pace, and perhaps, that is part of the a problem for some - it is not a whiz bang blow things up type of movie. Also, in the style of New Orleans, it has some odder characters appearing in the movie, and this undoubtedly is a turn-off for some. But the plot is skillfully woven, and grabs your attention at almost every turn. We generally found it riveting. John Cusack's performance was excellent, as was Kevin Spacey. The weakest link was Alison Eastwood, cast by her Dad, and really neither a good enough actor, or pretty enough for the role in which she was cast. But that was a small foible - you will have no regrets spending your 2 hrs watching this movie.

    "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" has a fairly inauspicious beginning for an Eastwood film, with journalist John Kelso (John Cusack) arriving in Savannah Georgia to document the Christmas party of local personality Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). Planted in the dense foliage of Georgia, a violent encounter soon sends Kelso on a trail of events to pry open the personal lives of these Cajun residents, and maybe even finding his story underneath it all. Whilst the film moves slow under its carefree southern veneer, the eccentric range of quirky characters, ranging from party-throwing squatters, a flirtatious transvestite, and best of all, a jive-talking voodoo practitioner, all provide entertaining and comedic encounters for Kelso. The film soon transitions to a courtroom drama that centers around the trial of millionaire Jim Williams, played by a moustachioed Kevin Spacey. He is able to pull of the accent convincingly, and that is all that is required in order for him to convince you as a southern artisocrat even as he spits out one-liners in supreme Spacey fashion. But there remains a hidden intention beneath his character's surface that he hints at all too well with the eyes. In fact, all the actors are in top form here, even a distracting Jude Law in a brief role. If it's anyone, it is John Cusack as the main character who perhaps leaves a bit more to be desired, along with his underdeveloped and tacked on love interest. Still, she is played well by Alison Eastwood, and together with Clint himself, they put together an atmospheric soundtrack that only adds to the immersion. Ill-paced and often confusing at times, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" is still a worthwhile romp into the secrets of America's southern edge... one that at times feels like another planet.

    John Kelso is a journalist sent by Town & Country magazine to eastern Georgia to cover a society party in Savannah thrown by Jim Williams, a prominent businessman. John is intrigued by the idiosyncrasies of the townsfolk but when Jim shoots and kills a young man later that night, he resolves to investigate the crime. This is the sort of well made, well acted, high quality movie I don't like. Its pedigree is too good - based on a highly acclaimed novel, made by an award-winning cast and crew, clocking in over 150 minutes and containing virtually no action. I guess there is an audience for such films, but it's not me. I'd drop most of the characters, halve the running time, put a car chase in the middle and have a shock twist at the end. Having said that, there is a lot to enjoy - all the performances are good, the best being Australian actor Thompson as Sonny, the good-natured but somewhat exasperated defence lawyer, and it's nice to see Eastwood's old buddy Lewis as the goofy head juror. The protagonist is interesting, as is often the case with stranger-in-a-strange land stories, and the voodoo priestess angle is amusing. In the end though, it's just much too long - the Lady Chablis drag act character has little connection to the case but has an hour of screen time - if I'd wanted to watch La Cage Aux Folles I would have just done so. Eastwood likes these people and their foibles, and is much more interested in exploring their lives than creating any kind of tension or suspense in what is primarily a crime story. Shot in beautiful locations in Savannah, and adapted from a bestselling novel by John Berendt, which was based on a real-life murder case.

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (or code name: MITGOGAE  damn, even that acronym is too long) was one of those movies I wanted to like more, but still did a lot. It's an enormously interesting story with fantastic characters and it was one of those films that restored (some) of my faith in John Cusack. This movie should be noteworthy for several interesting characters, such as Cusack's John Kelso and definitely, Kevin Spacey's flamboyant Jim Williams. But, overall, the winner goes to The Lady Chablis. She was amazing. And her interactions between her and John were key to the film's success for me. Okay, not just those scenes, but certainly a huge highlight whenever I revisit this film. Another great aspect of MITGOGAE was the setting and cinematography. The John Kelso character is out of his element in this Deep South surrounding and you'd be lying if you don't get swooped up right along with him, exploring on your own the differences from your world and this one. I get just as mesmerized as he is with all that this film sets up in regards to characters, landscaping, the houses and, heck, even the town is a character. Further, the story, a film noir mystery with multiples of twists, is as exciting to us as the onion peals back as it is to John Kelso. It's a murder mystery with intrigue and intelligence. Spacey and his character Jim Williams are both flipping interesting and exciting, it's absolutely a joy to watch him from scene to scene as he's caught up in this. Basically, writer John Kelso gets a freelance 500-word assignment he thinks he was randomly assigned to, to cover the annual extravagant Jim Williams' Christmas Party. Bummed it's not that big of an article, one-time novelist John Kelso begins his reporting when a "self-defense" murder takes place. Intrigued, John expands his investigation and thinks there's more to this story and this town than meets the eye. He's right. While not perfect and has its moments of slow-down and a totally sad ending to me  see it, and you'll know why I was bummed per my words above, it's a movie that draws me back to (the location of) Savannah time and again. If you're a fan of Cusack, Spacey and colorful backdrops, this is the movie for you. Give it a chance, and you might be a fan for life. "I've only been here three days and it's just a shooting, but give it time, okay. This place is fantastic. It's like Gone With the Wind on Mescalin. I know you're my agent. Listen to me, they walk imaginary pets here, Garland. On a fvcking leash. Alright? And they're all heavily armed and drunk. New York is boring!"  John Kelso.

    a form of delight. for the construction of characters grace impressive acting, for the atmosphere and a wise script. for little details who gives life not only for an inspired adaptation but for a nice and precise analysis of an universe. it is a special film for the force of performance and beautiful game of nuances. for the joy and for the pieces of drama as ambiguous dark water. for its magic in a different definition form. for its flavor who remember roots, tradition, crumbs from old Belle Epoque and collision between South and North vision about reality and rules. a seductive film , remarkable arena for few talented actors to do the best work.

    I do not understand why this movie gets low ratings like above.. I stumbled upon this gem a few weeks ago.. while browsing Clint 's work. This movie is undoubtedly one of my favs. The scenery is magic. The story is kinda weird and SEEMS somewhat boring.. hell no! Go & see! This is a movie who gets you to respect a lot of beautiful things about the American southern living, combined with a reserved style of acting. You will feel the dreamy pretty surroundings enter your mind.. The very reserved but glorifying act of mr. Spacey will get you to understand what acting is all about. He can do anything.. this guy is a genius. His accent is flawless... Cusack will do good as usual, staying with his regular next door guy but oh so relatable. But the flat ass shady lawyer (Aussie guy i believe) & Spacey will lift this movie with a mystery & vague feeling i have not ever seen before. It was one of those movies that was not a thrill to go and watch but on 'the watch' list for long, but i was wrong.. I should have seen it earlier. I loved it to pieces! If you care for top notch cast, mind blowing jazzy music, sweet & fairytale-scenery... kinda slow building & somewhat (double) funny & creepy vibe .. you have a golden night! Im not giving away any spoilers, but please see this! Its nothing like anything we know from the nowadays blockbusters. When i feel restless or not very happy .. i turn this on. Absolutely stunning filming Clint your awesome!

    Eastwood has proved himself as a filmmaker before--- but not here. This is a misfire. Sure, any movie has to have certain changes --- four trials distilled down into one, composite characters, even key manufactured roles thru which to "convey" the events to the audience--- but these were not the flaws in Eastwood's semi-botching of John Berendt's book. No, Clint just messed up the film on its own. And one gets the distinct feeling he optioned the movie rights to this as either a vanity project or because he liked Johnny Mercer's music. But not from a love of the subject matter. Much of the southern Gothic potential is squandered, the "sleepy" mood intended instead becomes mere glacial pacing, and there is an all-round bored feeling coming from the camera, from Mr. Eastwood...

Listen to me, they walk imaginary pets here, Garland. On a fvcking leash. Alright? And they're all heavily armed and drunk. New York is boring!"  John Kelso.

    I do not understand why this movie gets low ratings like above.. I stumbled upon this gem a few weeks ago.. while browsing Clint 's work. This movie is undoubtedly one of my favs. The scenery is magic. The story is kinda weird and SEEMS somewhat boring.. hell no! Go & see! This is a movie who gets you to respect a lot of beautiful things about the American southern living, combined with a reserved style of acting. You will feel the dreamy pretty surroundings enter your mind.. The very reserved but glorifying act of mr. Spacey will get you to understand what acting is all about. He can do anything.. this guy is a genius. His accent is flawless... Cusack will do good as usual, staying with his regular next door guy but oh so relatable. But the flat ass shady lawyer (Aussie guy i believe) & Spacey will lift this movie with a mystery & vague feeling i have not ever seen before. It was one of those movies that was not a thrill to go and watch but on 'the watch' list for long, but i was wrong.. I should have seen it earlier. I loved it to pieces! If you care for top notch cast, mind blowing jazzy music, sweet & fairytale-scenery... kinda slow building & somewhat (double) funny & creepy vibe .. you have a golden night! Im not giving away any spoilers, but please see this! Its nothing like anything we know from the nowadays blockbusters. When i feel restless or not very happy .. i turn this on. Absolutely stunning filming Clint your awesome!

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is about a small town trial about a murder that pits hard evidence against the prejudice of a community. In the end, the jury acquits the accused, but the accused also reveals that he had actually lied about the murder. I have a hard time figuring out the point (and genre) of the story. All along, we are pulled along to root for a court room drama that seems on path to being about overcoming small town prejudice to free an innocent man. But then at the end the man's innocence is put in question. So the resolution feels weird. The town is also weird (which seems to be a part of the story). The community is a closeted bunch of fruitcakes ruled by gossip and prejudice. The movie paints a vivid picture of the community's weirdness, but how does that serve the point of the story? I don't get it. And the genre is a little weird. If its a courtroom drama, then hard evidence should rule the day. If it's about the ambiguous nature of good and evil and the hidden powers of fate and voodoo on our lives, then fate and consequence should rule the day. I don't think you can mix them. The court room drama and hard evidence is what takes up screen time and pulls our attention forward, but then the climax switches the focus to the good/evil ambiguity and the sense that you get what you deserve by divine retribution. So we go along for one ride (Courtroom Drama) and finish on a different ride at the end (Good/Evil Contemplation/Fate). Makes me feel weird about the ticket I purchased at the beginning. A specific example is: the photographer took pictures of the crime scene and handed it to our protagonist. In a Courtroom Drama these types of actions should have consequences later (maybe he develops the film to find a clue). But it didn't happen. So the Genre is busted. We devoted a good portion of attention in the first half of the movie being sensitive to these clues in the story, but there is no payoff. So in the end we feel we have been duped and wrongly invested. One star for wasting my time. I think the Genre ambiguity might arise from the fact that this is a book adaptation. In the book medium, we can get inside the heads of the characters and try to make moral sense of the external actions. But it might not have translated so well in a movie.

    Eastwood has proved himself as a filmmaker before--- but not here. This is a misfire. Sure, any movie has to have certain changes --- four trials distilled down into one, composite characters, even key manufactured roles thru which to "convey" the events to the audience--- but these were not the flaws in Eastwood's semi-botching of John Berendt's book. No, Clint just messed up the film on its own. And one gets the distinct feeling he optioned the movie rights to this as either a vanity project or because he liked Johnny Mercer's music. But not from a love of the subject matter. Much of the southern Gothic potential is squandered, the "sleepy" mood intended instead becomes mere glacial pacing, and there is an all-round bored feeling coming from the camera, from Mr. Eastwood... Yes, there is a good cast, but nothing is done with them... Even the scene on which the title is based, the voodoo ritual in the graveyard, is as flat and uninspired as it could be. Clint seemed to ALMOST have the right idea, as the picture opens with a drifting, sailing shot over the marshes, fading into that statue in the moss-drenched Bonaventure cemetery --- all set to KD Lang's haunting version of a Mercer tune.... But it's pretty much downhill from there.

    Lady Chablis absolutely upstaged the rest of a very interesting cast. After seeing it recently after a hiatus of six or so years, I was amazed to see so many memorable actors from so many films making subtle cameo appearances. It was To Kill a Mockingbird meets Planet of the Apes meets Every Which Way but Loose, a combination of Classic, Cult, and Strange but in a fun way that John Cusak exploits as the observer who is enjoying the strange duality of the characters that he meets without embracing them and yet finds himself becoming part of their lives. The courtroom scenes were surprisingly realistic despite the constant presence of bizarre characters...yet beneath the bizarre is a tolerant reality...two different worlds co-existing and only rarely jarring together. This is a very unusual film, very, very "different" and hard to pigeonhole. It is memorable if just for that. The duality of Spacey's dripping charm character with a contempt and loathing for the very things he covets creates a conflict that is interesting to watch. The ending of the film makes more sense to me now than it once did, perhaps this is the type of film that grows on you. Lady Chablis, you go girl.

    Overlong, over baked, bore fest from our most OVERRATED Director. Moves along at a simmering pace with languishing, laughable, stereotypes, and never allowed to boil. Unnecessary irritating details at every unbelievable step, that pose as polite Southern charm and come across as unbearable overplay. This is another indication of a Director that has been given undue accolades involving mediocre work throughout his career behind the camera. He worked with Don Siegel and Sergio Leone a number of times but learned nothing of their intense style and edgy work. There are good actors in this film that go unchallenged and there is good material that is layered with so much "make-up" that the whole film is a pretension of excessive attention from a Director that needs a pacemaker.

    I to am at a loss as to how people cannot like this movie. The audience around the television was smaller this time, just I, my wife and one daughter (13 yrs old) and we found the movie engaging, intricate, and involving - it has a deliberate pace, and perhaps, that is part of the a problem for some - it is not a whiz bang blow things up type of movie. Also, in the style of New Orleans, it has some odder characters appearing in the movie, and this undoubtedly is a turn-off for some. But the plot is skillfully woven, and grabs your attention at almost every turn. We generally found it riveting. John Cusack's performance was excellent, as was Kevin Spacey. The weakest link was Alison Eastwood, cast by her Dad, and really neither a good enough actor, or pretty enough for the role in which she was cast. But that was a small foible - you will have no regrets spending your 2 hrs watching this movie.

    "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" has a fairly inauspicious beginning for an Eastwood film, with journalist John Kelso (John Cusack) arriving in Savannah Georgia to document the Christmas party of local personality Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). Planted in the dense foliage of Georgia, a violent encounter soon sends Kelso on a trail of events to pry open the personal lives of these Cajun residents, and maybe even finding his story underneath it all. Whilst the film moves slow under its carefree southern veneer, the eccentric range of quirky characters, ranging from party-throwing squatters, a flirtatious transvestite, and best of all, a jive-talking voodoo practitioner, all provide entertaining and comedic encounters for Kelso. The film soon transitions to a courtroom drama that centers around the trial of millionaire Jim Williams, played by a moustachioed Kevin Spacey. He is able to pull of the accent convincingly, and that is all that is required in order for him to convince you as a southern artisocrat even as he spits out one-liners in supreme Spacey fashion. But there remains a hidden intention beneath his character's surface that he hints at all too well with the eyes. In fact, all the actors are in top form here, even a distracting Jude Law in a brief role. If it's anyone, it is John Cusack as the main character who perhaps leaves a bit more to be desired, along with his underdeveloped and tacked on love interest. Still, she is played well by Alison Eastwood, and together with Clint himself, they put together an atmospheric soundtrack that only adds to the immersion. Ill-paced and often confusing at times, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" is still a worthwhile romp into the secrets of America's southern edge... one that at times feels like another planet.

    John Kelso is a journalist sent by Town & Country magazine to eastern Georgia to cover a society party in Savannah thrown by Jim Williams, a prominent businessman. John is intrigued by the idiosyncrasies of the townsfolk but when Jim shoots and kills a young man later that night, he resolves to investigate the crime. This is the sort of well made, well acted, high quality movie I don't like. Its pedigree is too good - based on a highly acclaimed novel, made by an award-winning cast and crew, clocking in over 150 minutes and containing virtually no action. I guess there is an audience for such films, but it's not me. I'd drop most of the characters, halve the running time, put a car chase in the middle and have a shock twist at the end. Having said that, there is a lot to enjoy - all the performances are good, the best being Australian actor Thompson as Sonny, the good-natured but somewhat exasperated defence lawyer, and it's nice to see Eastwood's old buddy Lewis as the goofy head juror. The protagonist is interesting, as is often the case with stranger-in-a-strange land stories, and the voodoo priestess angle is amusing. In the end though, it's just much too long - the Lady Chablis drag act character has little connection to the case but has an hour of screen time - if I'd wanted to watch La Cage Aux Folles I would have just done so. Eastwood likes these people and their foibles, and is much more interested in exploring their lives than creating any kind of tension or suspense in what is primarily a crime story. Shot in beautiful locations in Savannah, and adapted from a bestselling novel by John Berendt, which was based on a real-life murder case.

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (or code name: MITGOGAE  damn, even that acronym is too long) was one of those movies I wanted to like more, but still did a lot. It's an enormously interesting story with fantastic characters and it was one of those films that restored (some) of my faith in John Cusack. This movie should be noteworthy for several interesting characters, such as Cusack's John Kelso and definitely, Kevin Spacey's flamboyant Jim Williams. But, overall, the winner goes to The Lady Chablis. She was amazing. And her interactions between her and John were key to the film's success for me. Okay, not just those scenes, but certainly a huge highlight whenever I revisit this film. Another great aspect of MITGOGAE was the setting and cinematography. The John Kelso character is out of his element in this Deep South surrounding and you'd be lying if you don't get swooped up right along with him, exploring on your own the differences from your world and this one. I get just as mesmerized as he is with all that this film sets up in regards to characters, landscaping, the houses and, heck, even the town is a character. Further, the story, a film noir mystery with multiples of twists, is as exciting to us as the onion peals back as it is to John Kelso. It's a murder mystery with intrigue and intelligence. Spacey and his character Jim Williams are both flipping interesting and exciting, it's absolutely a joy to watch him from scene to scene as he's caught up in this. Basically, writer John Kelso gets a freelance 500-word assignment he thinks he was randomly assigned to, to cover the annual extravagant Jim Williams' Christmas Party. Bummed it's not that big of an article, one-time novelist John Kelso begins his reporting when a "self-defense" murder takes place. Intrigued, John expands his investigation and thinks there's more to this story and this town than meets the eye. He's right. While not perfect and has its moments of slow-down and a totally sad ending to me  see it, and you'll know why I was bummed per my words above, it's a movie that draws me back to (the location of) Savannah time and again. If you're a fan of Cusack, Spacey and colorful backdrops, this is the movie for you. Give it a chance, and you might be a fan for life. "I've only been here three days and it's just a shooting, but give it time, okay. This place is fantastic. It's like Gone With the Wind on Mescalin. I know you're my agent. Listen to me, they walk imaginary pets here, Garland. On a fvcking leash. Alright? And they're all heavily armed and drunk. New York is boring!"  John Kelso.

In the end though, it's just much too long - the Lady Chablis drag act character has little connection to the case but has an hour of screen time - if I'd wanted to watch La Cage Aux Folles I would have just done so. Eastwood likes these people and their foibles, and is much more interested in exploring their lives than creating any kind of tension or suspense in what is primarily a crime story. Shot in beautiful locations in Savannah, and adapted from a bestselling novel by John Berendt, which was based on a real-life murder case.

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (or code name: MITGOGAE  damn, even that acronym is too long) was one of those movies I wanted to like more, but still did a lot. It's an enormously interesting story with fantastic characters and it was one of those films that restored (some) of my faith in John Cusack. This movie should be noteworthy for several interesting characters, such as Cusack's John Kelso and definitely, Kevin Spacey's flamboyant Jim Williams. But, overall, the winner goes to The Lady Chablis. She was amazing. And her interactions between her and John were key to the film's success for me. Okay, not just those scenes, but certainly a huge highlight whenever I revisit this film. Another great aspect of MITGOGAE was the setting and cinematography. The John Kelso character is out of his element in this Deep South surrounding and you'd be lying if you don't get swooped up right along with him, exploring on your own the differences from your world and this one. I get just as mesmerized as he is with all that this film sets up in regards to characters, landscaping, the houses and, heck, even the town is a character. Further, the story, a film noir mystery with multiples of twists, is as exciting to us as the onion peals back as it is to John Kelso. It's a murder mystery with intrigue and intelligence. Spacey and his character Jim Williams are both flipping interesting and exciting, it's absolutely a joy to watch him from scene to scene as he's caught up in this. Basically, writer John Kelso gets a freelance 500-word assignment he thinks he was randomly assigned to, to cover the annual extravagant Jim Williams' Christmas Party. Bummed it's not that big of an article, one-time novelist John Kelso begins his reporting when a "self-defense" murder takes place. Intrigued, John expands his investigation and thinks there's more to this story and this town than meets the eye. He's right. While not perfect and has its moments of slow-down and a totally sad ending to me  see it, and you'll know why I was bummed per my words above, it's a movie that draws me back to (the location of) Savannah time and again. If you're a fan of Cusack, Spacey and colorful backdrops, this is the movie for you. Give it a chance, and you might be a fan for life. "I've only been here three days and it's just a shooting, but give it time, okay. This place is fantastic. It's like Gone With the Wind on Mescalin. I know you're my agent. Listen to me, they walk imaginary pets here, Garland. On a fvcking leash. Alright? And they're all heavily armed and drunk. New York is boring!"  John Kelso.

    a form of delight. for the construction of characters grace impressive acting, for the atmosphere and a wise script. for little details who gives life not only for an inspired adaptation but for a nice and precise analysis of an universe. it is a special film for the force of performance and beautiful game of nuances. for the joy and for the pieces of drama as ambiguous dark water. for its magic in a different definition form. for its flavor who remember roots, tradition, crumbs from old Belle Epoque and collision between South and North vision about reality and rules. a seductive film , remarkable arena for few talented actors to do the best work.

    I do not understand why this movie gets low ratings like above.. I stumbled upon this gem a few weeks ago.. while browsing Clint 's work. This movie is undoubtedly one of my favs. The scenery is magic. The story is kinda weird and SEEMS somewhat boring.. hell no! Go & see! This is a movie who gets you to respect a lot of beautiful things about the American southern living, combined with a reserved style of acting. You will feel the dreamy pretty surroundings enter your mind.. The very reserved but glorifying act of mr. Spacey will get you to understand what acting is all about. He can do anything.. this guy is a genius. His accent is flawless... Cusack will do good as usual, staying with his regular next door guy but oh so relatable. But the flat ass shady lawyer (Aussie guy i believe) & Spacey will lift this movie with a mystery & vague feeling i have not ever seen before. It was one of those movies that was not a thrill to go and watch but on 'the watch' list for long, but i was wrong.. I should have seen it earlier. I loved it to pieces! If you care for top notch cast, mind blowing jazzy music, sweet & fairytale-scenery... kinda slow building & somewhat (double) funny & creepy vibe .. you have a golden night! Im not giving away any spoilers, but please see this! Its nothing like anything we know from the nowadays blockbusters. When i feel restless or not very happy .. i turn this on. Absolutely stunning filming Clint your awesome!

    Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is about a small town trial about a murder that pits hard evidence against the prejudice of a community. In the end, the jury acquits the accused, but the accused also reveals that he had actually lied about the murder. I have a hard time figuring out the point (and genre) of the story. All along, we are pulled along to root for a court room drama that seems on path to being about overcoming small town prejudice to free an innocent man. But then at the end the man's innocence is put in question. So the resolution feels weird. The town is also weird (which seems to be a part of the story). The community is a closeted bunch of fruitcakes ruled by gossip and prejudice. The movie paints a vivid picture of the community's weirdness, but how does that serve the point of the story? I don't get it. And the genre is a little weird. If its a courtroom drama, then hard evidence should rule the day. If it's about the ambiguous nature of good and evil and the hidden powers of fate and voodoo on our lives, then fate and consequence should rule the day. I don't think you can mix them. The court room drama and hard evidence is what takes up screen time and pulls our attention forward, but then the climax switches the focus to the good/evil ambiguity and the sense that you get what you deserve by divine retribution. So we go along for one ride (Courtroom Drama) and finish on a different ride at the end (Good/Evil Contemplation/Fate). Makes me feel weird about the ticket I purchased at the beginning. A specific example is: the photographer took pictures of the crime scene and handed it to our protagonist. In a Courtroom Drama these types of actions should have consequences later (maybe he develops the film to find a clue). But it didn't happen. So the Genre is busted. We devoted a good portion of attention in the first half of the movie being sensitive to these clues in the story, but there is no payoff. So in the end we feel we have been duped and wrongly invested. One star for wasting my time. I think the Genre ambiguity might arise from the fact that this is a book adaptation. In the book medium, we can get inside the heads of the characters and try to make moral sense of the external actions. But it might not have translated so well in a movie. My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca

    Eastwood has proved himself as a filmmaker before--- but not here. This is a misfire. Sure, any movie has to have certain changes --- four trials distilled down into one, composite characters, even key manufactured roles thru which to "convey" the events to the audience--- but these were not the flaws in Eastwood's semi-botching of John Berendt's book. No, Clint just messed up the film on its own. And one gets the distinct feeling he optioned the movie rights to this as either a vanity project or because he liked Johnny Mercer's music. But not from a love of the subject matter. Much of the southern Gothic potential is squandered, the "sleepy" mood intended instead becomes mere glacial pacing, and there is an all-round bored feeling coming from the camera, from Mr. Eastwood... Yes, there is a good cast, but nothing is done with them... Even the scene on which the title is based, the voodoo ritual in the graveyard, is as flat and uninspired as it could be. Clint seemed to ALMOST have the right idea, as the picture opens with a drifting, sailing shot over the marshes, fading into that statue in the moss-drenched Bonaventure cemetery --- all set to KD Lang's haunting version of a Mercer tune.... But it's pretty much downhill from there.

    Lady Chablis absolutely upstaged the rest of a very interesting cast. After seeing it recently after a hiatus of six or so years, I was amazed to see so many memorable actors from so many films making subtle cameo appearances. It was To Kill a Mockingbird meets Planet of the Apes meets Every Which Way but Loose, a combination of Classic, Cult, and Strange but in a fun way that John Cusak exploits as the observer who is enjoying the strange duality of the characters that he meets without embracing them and yet finds himself becoming part of their lives. The courtroom scenes were surprisingly realistic despite the constant presence of bizarre characters...yet beneath the bizarre is a tolerant reality...two different worlds co-existing and only rarely jarring together. This is a very unusual film, very, very "different" and hard to pigeonhole. It is memorable if just for that. The duality of Spacey's dripping charm character with a contempt and loathing for the very things he covets creates a conflict that is interesting to watch. The ending of the film makes more sense to me now than it once did, perhaps this is the type of film that grows on you. Lady Chablis, you go girl.

    Overlong, over baked, bore fest from our most OVERRATED Director. Moves along at a simmering pace with languishing, laughable, stereotypes, and never allowed to boil. Unnecessary irritating details at every unbelievable step, that pose as polite Southern charm and come across as unbearable overplay. This is another indication of a Director that has been given undue accolades involving mediocre work throughout his career behind the camera. He worked with Don Siegel and Sergio Leone a number of times but learned nothing of their intense style and edgy work. There are good actors in this film that go unchallenged and there is good material that is layered with so much "make-up" that the whole film is a pretension of excessive attention from a Director that needs a pacemaker.

    I to am at a loss as to how people cannot like this movie. The audience around the television was smaller this time, just I, my wife and one daughter (13 yrs old) and we found the movie engaging, intricate, and involving - it has a deliberate pace, and perhaps, that is part of the a problem for some - it is not a whiz bang blow things up type of movie. Also, in the style of New Orleans, it has some odder characters appearing in the movie, and this undoubtedly is a turn-off for some. But the plot is skillfully woven, and grabs your attention at almost every turn. We generally found it riveting. John Cusack's performance was excellent, as was Kevin Spacey. The weakest link was Alison Eastwood, cast by her Dad, and really neither a good enough actor, or pretty enough for the role in which she was cast. But that was a small foible - you will have no regrets spending your 2 hrs watching this movie.

    "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" has a fairly inauspicious beginning for an Eastwood film, with journalist John Kelso (John Cusack) arriving in Savannah Georgia to document the Christmas party of local personality Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). Planted in the dense foliage of Georgia, a violent encounter soon sends Kelso on a trail of events to pry open the personal lives of these Cajun residents, and maybe even finding his story underneath it all. Whilst the film moves slow under its carefree southern veneer, the eccentric range of quirky characters, ranging from party-throwing squatters, a flirtatious transvestite, and best of all, a jive-talking voodoo practitioner, all provide entertaining and comedic encounters for Kelso. The film soon transitions to a courtroom drama that centers around the trial of millionaire Jim Williams, played by a moustachioed Kevin Spacey. He is able to pull of the accent convincingly, and that is all that is required in order for him to convince you as a southern artisocrat even as he spits out one-liners in supreme Spacey fashion. But there remains a hidden intention beneath his character's surface that he hints at all too well with the eyes. In fact, all the actors are in top form here, even a distracting Jude Law in a brief role. If it's anyone, it is John Cusack as the main character who perhaps leaves a bit more to be desired, along with his underdeveloped and tacked on love interest. Still, she is played well by Alison Eastwood, and together with Clint himself, they put together an atmospheric soundtrack that only adds to the immersion. Ill-paced and often confusing at times, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" is still a worthwhile romp into the secrets of America's southern edge... one that at times feels like another planet.

    John Kelso is a journalist sent by Town & Country magazine to eastern Georgia to cover a society party in Savannah thrown by Jim Williams, a prominent businessman. John is intrigued by the idiosyncrasies of the townsfolk but when Jim shoots and kills a young man later that night, he resolves to investigate the crime. This is the sort of well made, well acted, high quality movie I don't like. Its pedigree is too good - based on a highly acclaimed novel, made by an award-winning cast and crew, clocking in over 150 minutes and containing virtually no action. I guess there is an audience for such films, but it's not me. I'd drop most of the characters, halve the running time, put a car chase in the middle and have a shock twist at the end. Having said that, there is a lot to enjoy - all the performances are good, the best being Australian actor Thompson as Sonny, the good-natured but somewhat exasperated defence lawyer, and it's nice to see Eastwood's old buddy Lewis as the goofy head juror. The protagonist is interesting, as is often the case with stranger-in-a-strange land stories, and the voodoo priestess angle is amusing. In the end though, it's just much too long - the Lady Chablis drag act character has little connection to the case but has an hour of screen time - if I'd wanted to watch La Cage Aux Folles I would have just done so. Eastwood likes these people and their foibles, and is much more interested in exploring their lives than creating any kind of tension or suspense in what is primarily a crime story. Shot in beautiful locations in Savannah, and adapted from a bestselling novel by John Berendt, which was based on a real-life murder case.
