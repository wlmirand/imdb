    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves. Other disappointments include the special effects which look bad even for the time (the reptile creature looks awful while the ending is frankly stupid) and the total lack of screen presence by anyone other than Tagawa, who's memorable only by being hammy. As for Lambert, he does remarkably little throughout the film besides whispering that distinctive growl of his and laughing at random pauses in the dialogue for no reason. Given that his name is listed first in the credits, I would've expected more from him than that. Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't known for producing masterpieces that often (if at all) but "Mortal Kombat" is not a great picture by anyone's standards. Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

    As an adult I can't stand to look at this movie anymore . I still like the famous theme song . It's the best thing about this movie . The story is thin , but what could you expect from a movie based on a video game ? Especially such a game as Mortal kombat. It's funny. The special effects that were amazing when I was a kid , now look incredibly cheap. The acting is bad , with the exception of Christopher Lambert ("Highlander") who seems to be having fun as Rayden , so in the end he gives the best performance of movie. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a rather annoying performance as the main villain. The whole movie is a terrible kitsch , because it's too serious for it's own good . The lame action scenes can' save the movie . I also loved the "subtle" clues for Liu Kang how to defeat Sub Zero. Jesus , I know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! Anyway , it's trash . I have yet to see a good movie based on computer game. I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    This movie made me love "Mortal Kombat" even more. I'm not even kidding; that's how great this movie is. I thought the nonstop martial arts action was phenomenal, the actors were superb, and the overall movie was great. The best part of this film is that it has steady-paced fighting scenes. I really like the games in "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" and "Deception" on the PlayStation 2, but this movie brought "Mortal Kombat" to a whole new level of "greatness". If you are a fan of Martial Arts movies with very nice twists and turns, you will like this movie. I will continuously watch this movie. Great film!

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Watched this about a week ago with the hubby. He had never seen it and, even though I had, I was eager to watch it again. I still treasure this movie for its nostalgic value. My father took me to see this in the theater back in 1995 and I remember playing the game when I was younger. By today's standards, the graphics are embarrassingly laughable and, admittedly, the plot was always on the thin side, the character development was always weak, and the dialogue was always unsophisticated (all completely valid reasons for why my husband hated it). Still, it stirs up good childhood memories for me and I like this one for that reason alone.

    Paul W.S Anderson may be most remembered for his "Magnum Opus" of Resident Evil (1) but long before he lay down the line with Mortal Kombat, another video game adaption. His skills as a director may be questionable but I believes he does a fairly good job with "Mortal Kombat" given its poor premise, much like Street Fighter, that being based off a fighting game with supernatural characters. Christopher Lambert is a good choice for Rayden, and Liu Kang, Shang Tsung and Johnny Cage all get actors doing them justice. Featuring some nice scenery, memorable music and of course lots of martial arts fighting, it was a wet dream on screen for me and friends back in the mid 90's. The following movies derailed a lot and came to rely much CGI which this first movie is fortunately not graced with. Recommended to watch once, if you don't mind some clich&eacute; dialogue and over-abundance of fighting, probably nothing you'll want to watch again. 6/10

    Three martial artists--Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), Sonia (Bridgette Wilson) and Liu Kang (Robin Shou)--are gathered by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) to enter a contest where they fight other opponents with the fate of the world hanging in the balance--or something like that. Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in. This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of "wisdom". This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8. Very entertaining for what it is.

    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves.

Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    This movie made me love "Mortal Kombat" even more. I'm not even kidding; that's how great this movie is. I thought the nonstop martial arts action was phenomenal, the actors were superb, and the overall movie was great. The best part of this film is that it has steady-paced fighting scenes. I really like the games in "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" and "Deception" on the PlayStation 2, but this movie brought "Mortal Kombat" to a whole new level of "greatness". If you are a fan of Martial Arts movies with very nice twists and turns, you will like this movie. I will continuously watch this movie. Great film!

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Watched this about a week ago with the hubby. He had never seen it and, even though I had, I was eager to watch it again. I still treasure this movie for its nostalgic value. My father took me to see this in the theater back in 1995 and I remember playing the game when I was younger. By today's standards, the graphics are embarrassingly laughable and, admittedly, the plot was always on the thin side, the character development was always weak, and the dialogue was always unsophisticated (all completely valid reasons for why my husband hated it). Still, it stirs up good childhood memories for me and I like this one for that reason alone.

    Paul W.S Anderson may be most remembered for his "Magnum Opus" of Resident Evil (1) but long before he lay down the line with Mortal Kombat, another video game adaption. His skills as a director may be questionable but I believes he does a fairly good job with "Mortal Kombat" given its poor premise, much like Street Fighter, that being based off a fighting game with supernatural characters. Christopher Lambert is a good choice for Rayden, and Liu Kang, Shang Tsung and Johnny Cage all get actors doing them justice. Featuring some nice scenery, memorable music and of course lots of martial arts fighting, it was a wet dream on screen for me and friends back in the mid 90's. The following movies derailed a lot and came to rely much CGI which this first movie is fortunately not graced with. Recommended to watch once, if you don't mind some clich&eacute; dialogue and over-abundance of fighting, probably nothing you'll want to watch again. 6/10

    Three martial artists--Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), Sonia (Bridgette Wilson) and Liu Kang (Robin Shou)--are gathered by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) to enter a contest where they fight other opponents with the fate of the world hanging in the balance--or something like that. Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in. This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of "wisdom". This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8. Very entertaining for what it is.

    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves. Other disappointments include the special effects which look bad even for the time (the reptile creature looks awful while the ending is frankly stupid) and the total lack of screen presence by anyone other than Tagawa, who's memorable only by being hammy. As for Lambert, he does remarkably little throughout the film besides whispering that distinctive growl of his and laughing at random pauses in the dialogue for no reason. Given that his name is listed first in the credits, I would've expected more from him than that. Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't known for producing masterpieces that often (if at all) but "Mortal Kombat" is not a great picture by anyone's standards. Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

    As an adult I can't stand to look at this movie anymore . I still like the famous theme song . It's the best thing about this movie . The story is thin , but what could you expect from a movie based on a video game ? Especially such a game as Mortal kombat. It's funny. The special effects that were amazing when I was a kid , now look incredibly cheap. The acting is bad , with the exception of Christopher Lambert ("Highlander") who seems to be having fun as Rayden , so in the end he gives the best performance of movie. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a rather annoying performance as the main villain. The whole movie is a terrible kitsch , because it's too serious for it's own good . The lame action scenes can' save the movie . I also loved the "subtle" clues for Liu Kang how to defeat Sub Zero. Jesus , I know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! Anyway , it's trash . I have yet to see a good movie based on computer game. I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Three martial artists--Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), Sonia (Bridgette Wilson) and Liu Kang (Robin Shou)--are gathered by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) to enter a contest where they fight other opponents with the fate of the world hanging in the balance--or something like that. Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in. This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of "wisdom". This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8. Very entertaining for what it is.

    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves. Other disappointments include the special effects which look bad even for the time (the reptile creature looks awful while the ending is frankly stupid) and the total lack of screen presence by anyone other than Tagawa, who's memorable only by being hammy. As for Lambert, he does remarkably little throughout the film besides whispering that distinctive growl of his and laughing at random pauses in the dialogue for no reason. Given that his name is listed first in the credits, I would've expected more from him than that. Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't known for producing masterpieces that often (if at all) but "Mortal Kombat" is not a great picture by anyone's standards. Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

    As an adult I can't stand to look at this movie anymore . I still like the famous theme song . It's the best thing about this movie . The story is thin , but what could you expect from a movie based on a video game ? Especially such a game as Mortal kombat. It's funny. The special effects that were amazing when I was a kid , now look incredibly cheap. The acting is bad , with the exception of Christopher Lambert ("Highlander") who seems to be having fun as Rayden , so in the end he gives the best performance of movie. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a rather annoying performance as the main villain. The whole movie is a terrible kitsch , because it's too serious for it's own good . The lame action scenes can' save the movie . I also loved the "subtle" clues for Liu Kang how to defeat Sub Zero. Jesus , I know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! Anyway , it's trash . I have yet to see a good movie based on computer game. I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    This movie made me love "Mortal Kombat" even more. I'm not even kidding; that's how great this movie is. I thought the nonstop martial arts action was phenomenal, the actors were superb, and the overall movie was great. The best part of this film is that it has steady-paced fighting scenes. I really like the games in "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" and "Deception" on the PlayStation 2, but this movie brought "Mortal Kombat" to a whole new level of "greatness". If you are a fan of Martial Arts movies with very nice twists and turns, you will like this movie. I will continuously watch this movie. Great film!

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Watched this about a week ago with the hubby. He had never seen it and, even though I had, I was eager to watch it again. I still treasure this movie for its nostalgic value. My father took me to see this in the theater back in 1995 and I remember playing the game when I was younger. By today's standards, the graphics are embarrassingly laughable and, admittedly, the plot was always on the thin side, the character development was always weak, and the dialogue was always unsophisticated (all completely valid reasons for why my husband hated it). Still, it stirs up good childhood memories for me and I like this one for that reason alone.

    Paul W.S Anderson may be most remembered for his "Magnum Opus" of Resident Evil (1) but long before he lay down the line with Mortal Kombat, another video game adaption. His skills as a director may be questionable but I believes he does a fairly good job with "Mortal Kombat" given its poor premise, much like Street Fighter, that being based off a fighting game with supernatural characters. Christopher Lambert is a good choice for Rayden, and Liu Kang, Shang Tsung and Johnny Cage all get actors doing them justice. Featuring some nice scenery, memorable music and of course lots of martial arts fighting, it was a wet dream on screen for me and friends back in the mid 90's. The following movies derailed a lot and came to rely much CGI which this first movie is fortunately not graced with. Recommended to watch once, if you don't mind some clich&eacute; dialogue and over-abundance of fighting, probably nothing you'll want to watch again. 6/10

    Three martial artists--Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), Sonia (Bridgette Wilson) and Liu Kang (Robin Shou)--are gathered by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) to enter a contest where they fight other opponents with the fate of the world hanging in the balance--or something like that. Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in. This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of "wisdom". This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8. Very entertaining for what it is.

    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves. Other disappointments include the special effects which look bad even for the time (the reptile creature looks awful while the ending is frankly stupid) and the total lack of screen presence by anyone other than Tagawa, who's memorable only by being hammy. As for Lambert, he does remarkably little throughout the film besides whispering that distinctive growl of his and laughing at random pauses in the dialogue for no reason. Given that his name is listed first in the credits, I would've expected more from him than that. Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't known for producing masterpieces that often (if at all) but "Mortal Kombat" is not a great picture by anyone's standards. Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

    As an adult I can't stand to look at this movie anymore . I still like the famous theme song . It's the best thing about this movie . The story is thin , but what could you expect from a movie based on a video game ? Especially such a game as Mortal kombat. It's funny. The special effects that were amazing when I was a kid , now look incredibly cheap. The acting is bad , with the exception of Christopher Lambert ("Highlander") who seems to be having fun as Rayden , so in the end he gives the best performance of movie. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a rather annoying performance as the main villain. The whole movie is a terrible kitsch , because it's too serious for it's own good . The lame action scenes can' save the movie . I also loved the "subtle" clues for Liu Kang how to defeat Sub Zero. Jesus , I know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! Anyway , it's trash . I have yet to see a good movie based on computer game. I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Paul W.S Anderson may be most remembered for his "Magnum Opus" of Resident Evil (1) but long before he lay down the line with Mortal Kombat, another video game adaption. His skills as a director may be questionable but I believes he does a fairly good job with "Mortal Kombat" given its poor premise, much like Street Fighter, that being based off a fighting game with supernatural characters. Christopher Lambert is a good choice for Rayden, and Liu Kang, Shang Tsung and Johnny Cage all get actors doing them justice. Featuring some nice scenery, memorable music and of course lots of martial arts fighting, it was a wet dream on screen for me and friends back in the mid 90's. The following movies derailed a lot and came to rely much CGI which this first movie is fortunately not graced with. Recommended to watch once, if you don't mind some clich&eacute; dialogue and over-abundance of fighting, probably nothing you'll want to watch again. 6/10

    Three martial artists--Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), Sonia (Bridgette Wilson) and Liu Kang (Robin Shou)--are gathered by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) to enter a contest where they fight other opponents with the fate of the world hanging in the balance--or something like that. Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in. This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of "wisdom". This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8. Very entertaining for what it is.

    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves. Other disappointments include the special effects which look bad even for the time (the reptile creature looks awful while the ending is frankly stupid) and the total lack of screen presence by anyone other than Tagawa, who's memorable only by being hammy. As for Lambert, he does remarkably little throughout the film besides whispering that distinctive growl of his and laughing at random pauses in the dialogue for no reason. Given that his name is listed first in the credits, I would've expected more from him than that. Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't known for producing masterpieces that often (if at all) but "Mortal Kombat" is not a great picture by anyone's standards. Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

    As an adult I can't stand to look at this movie anymore . I still like the famous theme song . It's the best thing about this movie . The story is thin , but what could you expect from a movie based on a video game ? Especially such a game as Mortal kombat. It's funny. The special effects that were amazing when I was a kid , now look incredibly cheap. The acting is bad , with the exception of Christopher Lambert ("Highlander") who seems to be having fun as Rayden , so in the end he gives the best performance of movie. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a rather annoying performance as the main villain. The whole movie is a terrible kitsch , because it's too serious for it's own good . The lame action scenes can' save the movie . I also loved the "subtle" clues for Liu Kang how to defeat Sub Zero. Jesus , I know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! Anyway , it's trash . I have yet to see a good movie based on computer game. I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    This movie made me love "Mortal Kombat" even more. I'm not even kidding; that's how great this movie is. I thought the nonstop martial arts action was phenomenal, the actors were superb, and the overall movie was great. The best part of this film is that it has steady-paced fighting scenes. I really like the games in "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" and "Deception" on the PlayStation 2, but this movie brought "Mortal Kombat" to a whole new level of "greatness". If you are a fan of Martial Arts movies with very nice twists and turns, you will like this movie. I will continuously watch this movie. Great film!

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Watched this about a week ago with the hubby. He had never seen it and, even though I had, I was eager to watch it again. I still treasure this movie for its nostalgic value. My father took me to see this in the theater back in 1995 and I remember playing the game when I was younger. By today's standards, the graphics are embarrassingly laughable and, admittedly, the plot was always on the thin side, the character development was always weak, and the dialogue was always unsophisticated (all completely valid reasons for why my husband hated it). Still, it stirs up good childhood memories for me and I like this one for that reason alone.

    Paul W.S Anderson may be most remembered for his "Magnum Opus" of Resident Evil (1) but long before he lay down the line with Mortal Kombat, another video game adaption. His skills as a director may be questionable but I believes he does a fairly good job with "Mortal Kombat" given its poor premise, much like Street Fighter, that being based off a fighting game with supernatural characters. Christopher Lambert is a good choice for Rayden, and Liu Kang, Shang Tsung and Johnny Cage all get actors doing them justice. Featuring some nice scenery, memorable music and of course lots of martial arts fighting, it was a wet dream on screen for me and friends back in the mid 90's. The following movies derailed a lot and came to rely much CGI which this first movie is fortunately not graced with. Recommended to watch once, if you don't mind some clich&eacute; dialogue and over-abundance of fighting, probably nothing you'll want to watch again. 6/10

    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves. Other disappointments include the special effects which look bad even for the time (the reptile creature looks awful while the ending is frankly stupid) and the total lack of screen presence by anyone other than Tagawa, who's memorable only by being hammy. As for Lambert, he does remarkably little throughout the film besides whispering that distinctive growl of his and laughing at random pauses in the dialogue for no reason. Given that his name is listed first in the credits, I would've expected more from him than that. Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't known for producing masterpieces that often (if at all) but "Mortal Kombat" is not a great picture by anyone's standards. Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

Jesus , I know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! Anyway , it's trash . I have yet to see a good movie based on computer game. I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    This movie made me love "Mortal Kombat" even more. I'm not even kidding; that's how great this movie is. I thought the nonstop martial arts action was phenomenal, the actors were superb, and the overall movie was great. The best part of this film is that it has steady-paced fighting scenes. I really like the games in "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" and "Deception" on the PlayStation 2, but this movie brought "Mortal Kombat" to a whole new level of "greatness". If you are a fan of Martial Arts movies with very nice twists and turns, you will like this movie. I will continuously watch this movie. Great film!

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Watched this about a week ago with the hubby. He had never seen it and, even though I had, I was eager to watch it again. I still treasure this movie for its nostalgic value. My father took me to see this in the theater back in 1995 and I remember playing the game when I was younger. By today's standards, the graphics are embarrassingly laughable and, admittedly, the plot was always on the thin side, the character development was always weak, and the dialogue was always unsophisticated (all completely valid reasons for why my husband hated it). Still, it stirs up good childhood memories for me and I like this one for that reason alone.

    Paul W.S Anderson may be most remembered for his "Magnum Opus" of Resident Evil (1) but long before he lay down the line with Mortal Kombat, another video game adaption. His skills as a director may be questionable but I believes he does a fairly good job with "Mortal Kombat" given its poor premise, much like Street Fighter, that being based off a fighting game with supernatural characters. Christopher Lambert is a good choice for Rayden, and Liu Kang, Shang Tsung and Johnny Cage all get actors doing them justice. Featuring some nice scenery, memorable music and of course lots of martial arts fighting, it was a wet dream on screen for me and friends back in the mid 90's. The following movies derailed a lot and came to rely much CGI which this first movie is fortunately not graced with. Recommended to watch once, if you don't mind some clich&eacute; dialogue and over-abundance of fighting, probably nothing you'll want to watch again. 6/10

    Three martial artists--Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), Sonia (Bridgette Wilson) and Liu Kang (Robin Shou)--are gathered by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) to enter a contest where they fight other opponents with the fate of the world hanging in the balance--or something like that. Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in. This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of "wisdom". This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8. Very entertaining for what it is.

    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves. Other disappointments include the special effects which look bad even for the time (the reptile creature looks awful while the ending is frankly stupid) and the total lack of screen presence by anyone other than Tagawa, who's memorable only by being hammy. As for Lambert, he does remarkably little throughout the film besides whispering that distinctive growl of his and laughing at random pauses in the dialogue for no reason. Given that his name is listed first in the credits, I would've expected more from him than that. Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't known for producing masterpieces that often (if at all) but "Mortal Kombat" is not a great picture by anyone's standards. Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

    As an adult I can't stand to look at this movie anymore . I still like the famous theme song . It's the best thing about this movie . The story is thin , but what could you expect from a movie based on a video game ? Especially such a game as Mortal kombat. It's funny. The special effects that were amazing when I was a kid , now look incredibly cheap. The acting is bad , with the exception of Christopher Lambert ("Highlander") who seems to be having fun as Rayden , so in the end he gives the best performance of movie. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a rather annoying performance as the main villain. The whole movie is a terrible kitsch , because it's too serious for it's own good . The lame action scenes can' save the movie . I also loved the "subtle" clues for Liu Kang how to defeat Sub Zero. Jesus , I know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! Anyway , it's trash . I have yet to see a good movie based on computer game. I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Paul W.S Anderson may be most remembered for his "Magnum Opus" of Resident Evil (1) but long before he lay down the line with Mortal Kombat, another video game adaption. His skills as a director may be questionable but I believes he does a fairly good job with "Mortal Kombat" given its poor premise, much like Street Fighter, that being based off a fighting game with supernatural characters.

Featuring some nice scenery, memorable music and of course lots of martial arts fighting, it was a wet dream on screen for me and friends back in the mid 90's. The following movies derailed a lot and came to rely much CGI which this first movie is fortunately not graced with.

    Three martial artists--Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), Sonia (Bridgette Wilson) and Liu Kang (Robin Shou)--are gathered by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) to enter a contest where they fight other opponents with the fate of the world hanging in the balance--or something like that. Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in. This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of "wisdom". This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8. Very entertaining for what it is.

    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves. Other disappointments include the special effects which look bad even for the time (the reptile creature looks awful while the ending is frankly stupid) and the total lack of screen presence by anyone other than Tagawa, who's memorable only by being hammy. As for Lambert, he does remarkably little throughout the film besides whispering that distinctive growl of his and laughing at random pauses in the dialogue for no reason. Given that his name is listed first in the credits, I would've expected more from him than that. Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't known for producing masterpieces that often (if at all) but "Mortal Kombat" is not a great picture by anyone's standards. Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

    As an adult I can't stand to look at this movie anymore . I still like the famous theme song . It's the best thing about this movie . The story is thin , but what could you expect from a movie based on a video game ? Especially such a game as Mortal kombat. It's funny. The special effects that were amazing when I was a kid , now look incredibly cheap. The acting is bad , with the exception of Christopher Lambert ("Highlander") who seems to be having fun as Rayden , so in the end he gives the best performance of movie. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a rather annoying performance as the main villain. The whole movie is a terrible kitsch , because it's too serious for it's own good . The lame action scenes can' save the movie . I also loved the "subtle" clues for Liu Kang how to defeat Sub Zero. Jesus , I know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! Anyway , it's trash . I have yet to see a good movie based on computer game. I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    This movie made me love "Mortal Kombat" even more. I'm not even kidding; that's how great this movie is. I thought the nonstop martial arts action was phenomenal, the actors were superb, and the overall movie was great. The best part of this film is that it has steady-paced fighting scenes. I really like the games in "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" and "Deception" on the PlayStation 2, but this movie brought "Mortal Kombat" to a whole new level of "greatness". If you are a fan of Martial Arts movies with very nice twists and turns, you will like this movie. I will continuously watch this movie. Great film!

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Watched this about a week ago with the hubby. He had never seen it and, even though I had, I was eager to watch it again. I still treasure this movie for its nostalgic value. My father took me to see this in the theater back in 1995 and I remember playing the game when I was younger. By today's standards, the graphics are embarrassingly laughable and, admittedly, the plot was always on the thin side, the character development was always weak, and the dialogue was always unsophisticated (all completely valid reasons for why my husband hated it). Still, it stirs up good childhood memories for me and I like this one for that reason alone.

    Paul W.S Anderson may be most remembered for his "Magnum Opus" of Resident Evil (1) but long before he lay down the line with Mortal Kombat, another video game adaption. His skills as a director may be questionable but I believes he does a fairly good job with "Mortal Kombat" given its poor premise, much like Street Fighter, that being based off a fighting game with supernatural characters. Christopher Lambert is a good choice for Rayden, and Liu Kang, Shang Tsung and Johnny Cage all get actors doing them justice. Featuring some nice scenery, memorable music and of course lots of martial arts fighting, it was a wet dream on screen for me and friends back in the mid 90's. The following movies derailed a lot and came to rely much CGI which this first movie is fortunately not graced with. Recommended to watch once, if you don't mind some clich&eacute; dialogue and over-abundance of fighting, probably nothing you'll want to watch again. 6/10

    Three martial artists--Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), Sonia (Bridgette Wilson) and Liu Kang (Robin Shou)--are gathered by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) to enter a contest where they fight other opponents with the fate of the world hanging in the balance--or something like that. Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in. This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of "wisdom". This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8. Very entertaining for what it is.

    Before the video game wars meant Microsoft vs. Sony, it used to be Sega vs. Nintendo. Back when I was a kid, heated discussions would flare up as to whether "Street Fighter II" or "Mortal Kombat" was the best beat-em-up and naturally, their popularity meant that movie bosses were soon clamouring for the rights. Having witnessed the "Street Fighter" movie and being decidedly unimpressed with it, it only felt right to give its deadly rival a fair hearing too. Whilst this isn't anything like as tongue-in-cheek or hokey as "Street Fighter", there are still crucial pieces missing - namely decent effects, crummy plotting, forgettable actors and the noticeable lack of the game's excessive amounts of gore and controversy. When his brother is killed by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Liu Kang (Robin Chou) decides to seek vengeance himself. Together with martial arts movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Special Ops agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), the three of them are summoned by Tsung to compete in the Mortal Kombat tournament where the other-worldly citizens of Outworld threaten to invade our realm and enslave humanity forever. Guided by the enigmatic Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert, providing the film's sole star attraction), can our heroes hope to defeat Tsung or his monstrous general Goro? Raising the stakes in the familiar "fighting tournament" plot machine is one thing that "Mortal Kombat" tries in order to be different from the thousands of martial arts films out there. Another is the bombardment of cheesy Nineties dance music that sounds like a really bad compilation tape made at the time. But fans of the game will at least be pleased that there has been an attempt to remain faithful to the game's origins - characters look largely as they're supposed to while the sets are actually well constructed, if a little impractical. The fight scenes (which are in no short supply) even tries to throw in a few moves from the game but at times, it just looks ridiculous like Liu Kang's repeating flying kick thing. Unlike the game, however, there is no blood whatsoever bar the odd split lip and not even that many fatalities - baddies are simply knocked out "Xena: Warrior Princess"-style which is a big disappointment for fans of those gory finishing moves. Other disappointments include the special effects which look bad even for the time (the reptile creature looks awful while the ending is frankly stupid) and the total lack of screen presence by anyone other than Tagawa, who's memorable only by being hammy. As for Lambert, he does remarkably little throughout the film besides whispering that distinctive growl of his and laughing at random pauses in the dialogue for no reason. Given that his name is listed first in the credits, I would've expected more from him than that. Director Paul W.S. Anderson isn't known for producing masterpieces that often (if at all) but "Mortal Kombat" is not a great picture by anyone's standards. Granted, it is better than "Street Fighter" because it tries to maintain links with the game other than the names of the characters, although that damns "Mortal Kombat" with faint praise. But this is yet another half-arsed video-game adaptation that could and perhaps should have been better. As it is, I can't recommend it but if it spawned a sequel then maybe it did something right. But for me, this is as archaic and out-dated as your old 16-bit console - whichever one you had.

    As an adult I can't stand to look at this movie anymore . I still like the famous theme song . It's the best thing about this movie . The story is thin , but what could you expect from a movie based on a video game ? Especially such a game as Mortal kombat. It's funny. The special effects that were amazing when I was a kid , now look incredibly cheap. The acting is bad , with the exception of Christopher Lambert ("Highlander") who seems to be having fun as Rayden , so in the end he gives the best performance of movie. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa gives a rather annoying performance as the main villain. The whole movie is a terrible kitsch , because it's too serious for it's own good . The lame action scenes can' save the movie . I also loved the "subtle" clues for Liu Kang how to defeat Sub Zero. Jesus , I know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! Anyway , it's trash . I have yet to see a good movie based on computer game. I can agree that this isn't as bad as "Super Mario bros" . After all , they did make a sequel and TV series thanks to the success of this one. It doesn't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie. I give it 2/10.

    I thought that this movie was actually pretty good, probably because I'm such a huge fan of the video game series. The characters that appear in this movie are Kano (A villain who was originally a leader of the Black Dragon and serves Shang Tsuang), Liu Kang (One of the main protagonists of this film and became the Grand Champion), Raiden (A thunder god of the Mortal Kombat universe and protector of Earthrealm), Johhny Cage ( Another main protagonist who makes his living as a proteinous martial arts actor), Scorpion (Who is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge on Sub-Zero for murdering his family and clan known as the Shirai Ryu), Sub-Zero (Who is responsible for the death of Scorpion's family and clan), Sonya (Also another protagonist who makes her living as a FBI agent), Kitana (Princess of Outworld), Reptile (Another villain who serves Shang Tsuang in this film), Goro (Also another villain who is also working for Shang Tsuang and is prince of Shokan) and Shang Tsuang (Who is obviously the main villain). Now the flaws with the film are it's not very gory. Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series. The costumes weren't that bad but they were not good either; Raiden doesn't look like anything like he does in the games. Now I can explain the good stuff. Scorpion has his iconic line "Get Over Here!" and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch. The acting in this film was pretty good, Christopher Lambert did a good job playing Raiden, Robin Shou did a decent job representing his character Liu Kang, Linden Ashby was pretty good as Sonya, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa did an awesome job playing Shang Tsuang and Talisa Soto played the beautiful princess known as Kitana and she also did a decent job. The theme they used in this film is freaking awesome, whenever I hear this theme tune, I was pumped up for action! Each character has some similar backgrounds borrowed from the game and I also saw some similar moves from the game such as Johnny Cage's nut punch. Overall, this film was pretty average to watch. If your a big fan of Mortal Kombat and action films, then I would recommend this. If they are going to remake Mortal Kombat, make sure you don't make the same mistakes again, especially rating it PG-13 or 15. 6.5/10

    This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all. I remember watching this when it first came out on VHS and have seen it multiple times since it's release and still enjoy it from start to finish. All fight scenes were very entertaining my favorites were Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. The characters are very convincing. Sonya with her cockiness, Johnny with his spoiled Hollywood lifestyle, Liu kang with his stubbornness, and so on and so on. But all in all this is a great kung fu movie with plenty of action and fighting scenes so if your a fan of the games this is a must see for you.

    Based on the popular arcade game, Mortal Kombat is essentially a film about 3 people, "Liu Kang" (Robin Shau), "Johnny Cage" (Linden Ashby) and "Sonya Blade" (Bridgette Wilson), who enter a martial arts competition in order to save the world from "Shang Tsung" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil subjects. Filled with non-stop action, stunts and special effects, it is a movie that is best enjoyed on the big screen. It's both exciting and fun. The music, which won the BMI Film Music Award, also enhances the film quite well. Unfortunately, the acting left much to be desired, especially on the part of Robin Shau and Bridgette Wilson. Be that as it may, the acting is clearly secondary to the special effects and action. Likewise, I was a little disappointed with the dialogue and the fact that "Scorpion" (Chris Casamassa) and "Sub-Zero" (Francois Petit) didn't have nearly the character development of "Lord Rayden" (Christopher Lambert) who I believe essentially steals the show. Anyway, all things considered I thought it was a fun movie and I think fans of action will certainly enjoy it.

    The only way I can review this is the pros, cons, similarities, and differences between the game and the movie. Similarities: 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro. 2. Scorpion has his iconic "Get over here!" accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands. 3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game. 4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones. 5. Three words: Johnny Cage's nutshots. Differences: 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible. 2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved. Pros: 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time. 2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games "should" be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie. 3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example: Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal). Cons: 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect. 2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous. 3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality. Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

    Watched this about a week ago with the hubby. He had never seen it and, even though I had, I was eager to watch it again. I still treasure this movie for its nostalgic value. My father took me to see this in the theater back in 1995 and I remember playing the game when I was younger. By today's standards, the graphics are embarrassingly laughable and, admittedly, the plot was always on the thin side, the character development was always weak, and the dialogue was always unsophisticated (all completely valid reasons for why my husband hated it). Still, it stirs up good childhood memories for me and I like this one for that reason alone.

    Paul W.S Anderson may be most remembered for his "Magnum Opus" of Resident Evil (1) but long before he lay down the line with Mortal Kombat, another video game adaption. His skills as a director may be questionable but I believes he does a fairly good job with "Mortal Kombat" given its poor premise, much like Street Fighter, that being based off a fighting game with supernatural characters. Christopher Lambert is a good choice for Rayden, and Liu Kang, Shang Tsung and Johnny Cage all get actors doing them justice. Featuring some nice scenery, memorable music and of course lots of martial arts fighting, it was a wet dream on screen for me and friends back in the mid 90's. The following movies derailed a lot and came to rely much CGI which this first movie is fortunately not graced with. Recommended to watch once, if you don't mind some clich&eacute; dialogue and over-abundance of fighting, probably nothing you'll want to watch again. 6/10

    Three martial artists--Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby), Sonia (Bridgette Wilson) and Liu Kang (Robin Shou)--are gathered by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) to enter a contest where they fight other opponents with the fate of the world hanging in the balance--or something like that. Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in. This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of "wisdom". This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8. Very entertaining for what it is.
