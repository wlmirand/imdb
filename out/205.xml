    George C. Scott stars as General George Patton, legendary tank commander that traces his career through his North Africa campaign, the invasion of Germany, and finally commander of occupational forces in Germany. It also profiles his friend and colleague General Omar Bradley(Karl Malden, also superb) who tries in vain to influence Patton to not be so unforgiving to his own men(especially in memorable scene of him slapping an unhappy soldier, likely suffering from post-traumatic-stress disorder, an undiagnosed condition at that time) and his rebellious nature toward authority(when he believes it to be wrong) which threatened his own command, and any political aspirations he may have had, which he claimed were none. Superbly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, intelligently scripted and impressively mounted battles is a textbook case on how to do a film biography. This ranks as one of the best.

    Although I think George C Scott is a great actor, I do not understand why this film won 7 Oscars when several superb historic war films also produced in 1970 received little acclaim. This is yet another of the almost limitless American films post WW2 which glorifies one of their famous generals. True it shows his vanity and cruelty as well, but as a military historian myself I really wonder why such average war scenes rated so highly? For example Patton's triumph after Kasserine is portrayed in almost laughable battles-scenes. We have modern M60 tanks (ironically the "Patton") with black crosses on the side pretending to be German tanks and German infantry marching in Napoleonic dense columns towards the US Army. Its incredibly bad even by the standard of the time (and Gen Bradley was the military adviser?). I do like the acting in the film. I think George C Scott is great and well deserves the accolades. But I do wonder why the outstanding films "Waterloo" and "Cromwell" shown also in 1970 did not receive wide acclaim, despite being in my opinion some of the best films ever put on film. Waterloo is probably the most impressive cinematic representation of a historic battle ever made - never again will a film be made like this. I can't help but think it does help if your film is about an American war hero, with famous American actors for Americans (like almost every successful film that has been made in the English speaking world since 1945). Interesting that a Bridge to Far which has faultless battle scenes and outstanding moving acting did not receive anything like 7 Oscars! I wonder why?

    Fascinating Character Study, Oscar Winner (He refused it) George C. Scott gives a Universally praised Performance that is without doubt the best part of this Academy Award 7 Time Winner. The Script is also a significant achievement weaving Pro and Anti War sentiments effortlessly. There are so many quotable lines...here is one..."Compared to War, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance" That is a summation of Patton and the Movie does give a slightly Romantic vision of the most Controversial, Flamboyant, and Charismatic Military Leader of His Era. In contrast, Eisenhower barely had a Heartbeat and was dull and humorless. The Film is Framed and Shot entirely from Patton's point of view. The Battles are shown mostly in Wide Shots and the carnage is only glimpsed after the fact. The Deaths and suffering of the Soldiers underneath this self identified Demi-God are to Him like Players on a Stage or Pawns in a Game. He was eccentric, to say the least, and fancied Himself a Man with a Destiny. He believed in Reincarnation. But this often alluded to Spiritual Belief, is shown to be insincere when after He is told that the Future of War will be pushbutton He states..."Thank God I won't be around to see it". But most of the Movie is consistent in its telling of this Larger Than Life, frightening, Dictator Wannabe and it gives the sense that this unhinged Man would not be much different than the Evil Despots who were the Enemy. Overall, it is an Overrated Film but is quite good and worth watching as a Dramatic representation of an Egomaniac, who like most of His ilk, left to their own devices, would more than likely cause more harm than good. Having this Man with His hand on the button is a very dangerous thing. Reference Scott's Role as an Air Force General in Dr. Strangelove (1964). That could be Patton Reincarnated.

    Overblown docu-drama about the boorish army general plastically played by George Scott. I've found that movie-goers really don't know anything about film-making or acting, so their opinions are often overkill in praise. Big productions sucker most folks into believing a film is a lot better than it actually is, the same way a terrible actor can get rave reviews just because he did a role in which he had little dialogue accompanied with an abundance of serious frowns. Any hack director (in this case, Frank Schaffner) can make a movie appear 'extraordinary' with the mechanical slight of hand found here, starting with a long running-time so he can bring the story to the proverbial snail's crawl by interjecting time-consuming pans of landscape and wannabe-poignant shreds of empty dialogue, most of it by Scott as he waxes poetic while concomitantly striking pretentious poses. Just another war film, this one painted in American Neon, concomitantly salted with Scott's glazed ham performance. I'm an Ivy League grad from Penn and I still sat through this pomp and circumstance for almost three hours.... wow, I must have been really bored that day.

    George C Scott dominates this film in a memorable portrayal of US General Patton. Once in a lifetime can an actor get such an opportunity. Mr. Scott brings General Patton to life in a bravura performance. FrankliN Schaffner was a fine Director and he guises the film brilliantly but it is George C Scott who gives one of the greatest male performances I have ever seen. As we all know, Mr. Scott refused the Oscar for which he so richly earned. A fine supporting cast in this 20th Century Fox film which was a smash hit.

    Here's a sto-ry..... of an ego-tis-ti-cal general. C. Scott George - or whatever his name is - tries to capture the fierceness of the pretentious World War II field commander by attempting to sound 'gruff' - of course, Scott always sounded that way. A film quite over-rated, even when it was first released in 1970 (1970! Was that even a real year?). Film is long and mostly boring, only coming to life during the few and far between battle scenes. Ironically, Karl Malden may have offered his best performance here (which isn't saying much, because he was a terrible actor). 3 stars for pomp and circumstance.

    I am a retired history teacher and am insufferable to be with if you are watching a historical picture. I tend to notice all the mistakes--making "Pocahontas", "The Sound of Music" and "Midway" (as examples) films you would hate to watch with me. I cannot help but should out 'these films are FILLED with glaring errors--what's WRONG with these people?!?!'--and you will no doubt hate me for it! But, "Patton" is a rare example where I won't complain. Sure, many of the tanks are NOT WWII vintage and a few facts here and there aren't exactly correct. BUT, the sheer force of George C. Scott's portrayal make the film riveting from start to finish. A truly exceptional film and a film which CLEARLY earned Scott the Oscar he ultimately refused! See this film but do NOT see the sequel that was made for TV a decade or so later--it is simply awful and pointless!

    A few random thoughts: 1. The great broadcaster Walter Cronkite, who covered Patton during the war, felt this film captured the man extremely well. 2. My favorite scene in the movies, any movie, is where Patton looks out over the ancient battlefield (Rome vs. Carthage), the music flares gently, he describes the battle in a few succinct sentences, pauses, and says, "I was here." 2a. My favorite sequence in the movies, any movie, is Patton's pivot north to relieve Bastogne, from the first stirrings of enemy activity in the Ardennes Forest to the chaplain's successful prayer for good weather. 3. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) comes off very well in the movie. This may be historically inaccurate. The excellent military historian Victor Davis Hanson, in his 1999 book "The Soul of Battle," rips apart Bradley for his bureaucratic timidity (he does the same for Ike) and praises Patton to the skies. Davis' writing on Patton is splendid. 4. I like how the movie leaves implicit, rather than making explicit, a central fact: Patton's pursuit of military glory was in congruence with America's best interests in the war. There was no conflict whatsoever between him needing to be great and America's need to win; in fact, his ambition fueled our victory. 5. President Nixon reportedly watched this film a number of times before the invasion of Cambodia. When I was a kid I scoffed at this. Oddly enough, the older I get, the more I understand it. Not the invasion. The watching of the movie to brace himself for a massive task. 6. The script is really good. It takes a massive, sprawling topic and makes it manageable and fascinating. A well deserved Oscar for Francis Ford Coppola.

    Sometimes in life, a human being may have unlikable qualities, yet still be extremely likable in spite of all that. George C. Scott and General George Patton shared both of those qualities, so how ironic to have them associated together through this Oscar Winning Best Film. This is one time in watching a movie where it does help to know a little something not only about the character the leading man is playing, but the leading man himself. With his raspy voice, not quite leading man physical looks and a controversial off-screen image, George C. Scott is a most fascinating actor because in spite of everything, you can't help but like him. In playing one of America's most controversial World War II figures, Scott gave a solid performance that is captivating even when he is being less than kind to the people who are serving under him. Even if he just appeared in a short covering the opening sequence (the classic speech in front of the giant American flag), Scott would have entered screen immortality. But there's another three hours after that amazing sequence (which screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola claims almost got him fired off this project), and that is three hours of solid entertainment. Any man who can use the Lord's name in vain while professing his belief in God is a fascinating character to watch, whether you agree with how he feels or not. When Scott attacks a soldier on the verge of a nervous breakdown in front of the wounded in the hospital, you sense both his compassion (for the wounded) and the reasons for his anger at the soldier he humiliates. This isn't a war epic about amazing battle scenes, although the strategies that Patton reveals are very interesting. When Scott is off screen, you will be riveted to the sequences where Nazi officers reveal aspects of Patton they have discovered themselves to their amusement. The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't. Karl Malden offers solid support as Patton's right hand man, perhaps the only man who truly understands him and accepts him for who he is. The ending reminded me of the final scene between Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains in "Casablanca".

    The critics who dismiss this film as bad primarily because it is pro-American seem blinded to the probability that it's the most complex and artful film representation of the fierce pride and nagging problems that come with commanding any army of a democracy in a great war. (Perhaps their ancestors who served in that democratic army, or who were liberated in their millions by 20th century American soldiers, would be less inclined to condemn this portrayal of those soldiers and their leaders.) In any case, Patton, the poet, the historian, the bully, the sentimentalist, the great tactician and embarrassing propagandist, is shown in this haunting film to be the ultimate representative of type: the tyrant we call on to ensure defeat of the Great Tyrant. Of course, "democratic army" is an implied contradiction, and it is exactly this paradox that is examined and illustrated so brilliantly in Patton. The General knew enough about history to realize he would be harshly judged by some historians, the latter day advocates of political correctness, as he had been in his own lifetime. Of course, there is ambiguity in his character and ambivalence in people's feelings about him. (An old Warrant Officer told me he was in a military hospital in occupied German and when Patton's death was announced, half the soldiers there cried and the other half cheered.) He is hardly painted with untainted glory in this film, which captures well his self-awareness. Contrast Scott's perfectly delivered profane-glorious speech in the first innovative moments of the film with his message in the final scene when the resigned old warhorse, walking away from us into history, reminds himself and us: "All glory is fleeting." This is impeccably balanced work by writers North and Coppola, with superb directing by Schaffner, backed throughout by Goldsmith's alternately triumphant and plaintive score. Listen to the recurring "distant trumpets" (echoed in Saving Private Ryan). Patton is a classic.

The ending reminded me of the final scene between Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains in "Casablanca".

    The critics who dismiss this film as bad primarily because it is pro-American seem blinded to the probability that it's the most complex and artful film representation of the fierce pride and nagging problems that come with commanding any army of a democracy in a great war. (Perhaps their ancestors who served in that democratic army, or who were liberated in their millions by 20th century American soldiers, would be less inclined to condemn this portrayal of those soldiers and their leaders.) In any case, Patton, the poet, the historian, the bully, the sentimentalist, the great tactician and embarrassing propagandist, is shown in this haunting film to be the ultimate representative of type: the tyrant we call on to ensure defeat of the Great Tyrant. Of course, "democratic army" is an implied contradiction, and it is exactly this paradox that is examined and illustrated so brilliantly in Patton. The General knew enough about history to realize he would be harshly judged by some historians, the latter day advocates of political correctness, as he had been in his own lifetime. Of course, there is ambiguity in his character and ambivalence in people's feelings about him. (An old Warrant Officer told me he was in a military hospital in occupied German and when Patton's death was announced, half the soldiers there cried and the other half cheered.) He is hardly painted with untainted glory in this film, which captures well his self-awareness. Contrast Scott's perfectly delivered profane-glorious speech in the first innovative moments of the film with his message in the final scene when the resigned old warhorse, walking away from us into history, reminds himself and us: "All glory is fleeting." This is impeccably balanced work by writers North and Coppola, with superb directing by Schaffner, backed throughout by Goldsmith's alternately triumphant and plaintive score. Listen to the recurring "distant trumpets" (echoed in Saving Private Ryan). Patton is a classic.

    George C. Scott stars as General George Patton, legendary tank commander that traces his career through his North Africa campaign, the invasion of Germany, and finally commander of occupational forces in Germany. It also profiles his friend and colleague General Omar Bradley(Karl Malden, also superb) who tries in vain to influence Patton to not be so unforgiving to his own men(especially in memorable scene of him slapping an unhappy soldier, likely suffering from post-traumatic-stress disorder, an undiagnosed condition at that time) and his rebellious nature toward authority(when he believes it to be wrong) which threatened his own command, and any political aspirations he may have had, which he claimed were none. Superbly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, intelligently scripted and impressively mounted battles is a textbook case on how to do a film biography. This ranks as one of the best.

    Although I think George C Scott is a great actor, I do not understand why this film won 7 Oscars when several superb historic war films also produced in 1970 received little acclaim. This is yet another of the almost limitless American films post WW2 which glorifies one of their famous generals. True it shows his vanity and cruelty as well, but as a military historian myself I really wonder why such average war scenes rated so highly? For example Patton's triumph after Kasserine is portrayed in almost laughable battles-scenes. We have modern M60 tanks (ironically the "Patton") with black crosses on the side pretending to be German tanks and German infantry marching in Napoleonic dense columns towards the US Army. Its incredibly bad even by the standard of the time (and Gen Bradley was the military adviser?). I do like the acting in the film. I think George C Scott is great and well deserves the accolades. But I do wonder why the outstanding films "Waterloo" and "Cromwell" shown also in 1970 did not receive wide acclaim, despite being in my opinion some of the best films ever put on film. Waterloo is probably the most impressive cinematic representation of a historic battle ever made - never again will a film be made like this. I can't help but think it does help if your film is about an American war hero, with famous American actors for Americans (like almost every successful film that has been made in the English speaking world since 1945). Interesting that a Bridge to Far which has faultless battle scenes and outstanding moving acting did not receive anything like 7 Oscars! I wonder why?

    Fascinating Character Study, Oscar Winner (He refused it) George C. Scott gives a Universally praised Performance that is without doubt the best part of this Academy Award 7 Time Winner. The Script is also a significant achievement weaving Pro and Anti War sentiments effortlessly. There are so many quotable lines...here is one..."Compared to War, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance" That is a summation of Patton and the Movie does give a slightly Romantic vision of the most Controversial, Flamboyant, and Charismatic Military Leader of His Era. In contrast, Eisenhower barely had a Heartbeat and was dull and humorless. The Film is Framed and Shot entirely from Patton's point of view. The Battles are shown mostly in Wide Shots and the carnage is only glimpsed after the fact. The Deaths and suffering of the Soldiers underneath this self identified Demi-God are to Him like Players on a Stage or Pawns in a Game. He was eccentric, to say the least, and fancied Himself a Man with a Destiny. He believed in Reincarnation. But this often alluded to Spiritual Belief, is shown to be insincere when after He is told that the Future of War will be pushbutton He states..."Thank God I won't be around to see it". But most of the Movie is consistent in its telling of this Larger Than Life, frightening, Dictator Wannabe and it gives the sense that this unhinged Man would not be much different than the Evil Despots who were the Enemy. Overall, it is an Overrated Film but is quite good and worth watching as a Dramatic representation of an Egomaniac, who like most of His ilk, left to their own devices, would more than likely cause more harm than good. Having this Man with His hand on the button is a very dangerous thing. Reference Scott's Role as an Air Force General in Dr. Strangelove (1964). That could be Patton Reincarnated.

    Overblown docu-drama about the boorish army general plastically played by George Scott. I've found that movie-goers really don't know anything about film-making or acting, so their opinions are often overkill in praise. Big productions sucker most folks into believing a film is a lot better than it actually is, the same way a terrible actor can get rave reviews just because he did a role in which he had little dialogue accompanied with an abundance of serious frowns. Any hack director (in this case, Frank Schaffner) can make a movie appear 'extraordinary' with the mechanical slight of hand found here, starting with a long running-time so he can bring the story to the proverbial snail's crawl by interjecting time-consuming pans of landscape and wannabe-poignant shreds of empty dialogue, most of it by Scott as he waxes poetic while concomitantly striking pretentious poses. Just another war film, this one painted in American Neon, concomitantly salted with Scott's glazed ham performance. I'm an Ivy League grad from Penn and I still sat through this pomp and circumstance for almost three hours.... wow, I must have been really bored that day.

    George C Scott dominates this film in a memorable portrayal of US General Patton. Once in a lifetime can an actor get such an opportunity. Mr. Scott brings General Patton to life in a bravura performance. FrankliN Schaffner was a fine Director and he guises the film brilliantly but it is George C Scott who gives one of the greatest male performances I have ever seen. As we all know, Mr. Scott refused the Oscar for which he so richly earned. A fine supporting cast in this 20th Century Fox film which was a smash hit.

    Here's a sto-ry..... of an ego-tis-ti-cal general. C. Scott George - or whatever his name is - tries to capture the fierceness of the pretentious World War II field commander by attempting to sound 'gruff' - of course, Scott always sounded that way. A film quite over-rated, even when it was first released in 1970 (1970! Was that even a real year?). Film is long and mostly boring, only coming to life during the few and far between battle scenes. Ironically, Karl Malden may have offered his best performance here (which isn't saying much, because he was a terrible actor). 3 stars for pomp and circumstance.

    I am a retired history teacher and am insufferable to be with if you are watching a historical picture. I tend to notice all the mistakes--making "Pocahontas", "The Sound of Music" and "Midway" (as examples) films you would hate to watch with me. I cannot help but should out 'these films are FILLED with glaring errors--what's WRONG with these people?!?!'--and you will no doubt hate me for it! But, "Patton" is a rare example where I won't complain. Sure, many of the tanks are NOT WWII vintage and a few facts here and there aren't exactly correct. BUT, the sheer force of George C. Scott's portrayal make the film riveting from start to finish. A truly exceptional film and a film which CLEARLY earned Scott the Oscar he ultimately refused! See this film but do NOT see the sequel that was made for TV a decade or so later--it is simply awful and pointless!

    A few random thoughts: 1. The great broadcaster Walter Cronkite, who covered Patton during the war, felt this film captured the man extremely well. 2. My favorite scene in the movies, any movie, is where Patton looks out over the ancient battlefield (Rome vs. Carthage), the music flares gently, he describes the battle in a few succinct sentences, pauses, and says, "I was here." 2a. My favorite sequence in the movies, any movie, is Patton's pivot north to relieve Bastogne, from the first stirrings of enemy activity in the Ardennes Forest to the chaplain's successful prayer for good weather. 3. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) comes off very well in the movie. This may be historically inaccurate. The excellent military historian Victor Davis Hanson, in his 1999 book "The Soul of Battle," rips apart Bradley for his bureaucratic timidity (he does the same for Ike) and praises Patton to the skies. Davis' writing on Patton is splendid. 4. I like how the movie leaves implicit, rather than making explicit, a central fact: Patton's pursuit of military glory was in congruence with America's best interests in the war. There was no conflict whatsoever between him needing to be great and America's need to win; in fact, his ambition fueled our victory. 5. President Nixon reportedly watched this film a number of times before the invasion of Cambodia. When I was a kid I scoffed at this. Oddly enough, the older I get, the more I understand it. Not the invasion. The watching of the movie to brace himself for a massive task. 6. The script is really good. It takes a massive, sprawling topic and makes it manageable and fascinating. A well deserved Oscar for Francis Ford Coppola.

    Sometimes in life, a human being may have unlikable qualities, yet still be extremely likable in spite of all that. George C. Scott and General George Patton shared both of those qualities, so how ironic to have them associated together through this Oscar Winning Best Film. This is one time in watching a movie where it does help to know a little something not only about the character the leading man is playing, but the leading man himself. With his raspy voice, not quite leading man physical looks and a controversial off-screen image, George C. Scott is a most fascinating actor because in spite of everything, you can't help but like him. In playing one of America's most controversial World War II figures, Scott gave a solid performance that is captivating even when he is being less than kind to the people who are serving under him. Even if he just appeared in a short covering the opening sequence (the classic speech in front of the giant American flag), Scott would have entered screen immortality. But there's another three hours after that amazing sequence (which screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola claims almost got him fired off this project), and that is three hours of solid entertainment. Any man who can use the Lord's name in vain while professing his belief in God is a fascinating character to watch, whether you agree with how he feels or not. When Scott attacks a soldier on the verge of a nervous breakdown in front of the wounded in the hospital, you sense both his compassion (for the wounded) and the reasons for his anger at the soldier he humiliates. This isn't a war epic about amazing battle scenes, although the strategies that Patton reveals are very interesting. When Scott is off screen, you will be riveted to the sequences where Nazi officers reveal aspects of Patton they have discovered themselves to their amusement. The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't. Karl Malden offers solid support as Patton's right hand man, perhaps the only man who truly understands him and accepts him for who he is.

The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't. Karl Malden offers solid support as Patton's right hand man, perhaps the only man who truly understands him and accepts him for who he is. The ending reminded me of the final scene between Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains in "Casablanca".

    The critics who dismiss this film as bad primarily because it is pro-American seem blinded to the probability that it's the most complex and artful film representation of the fierce pride and nagging problems that come with commanding any army of a democracy in a great war. (Perhaps their ancestors who served in that democratic army, or who were liberated in their millions by 20th century American soldiers, would be less inclined to condemn this portrayal of those soldiers and their leaders.) In any case, Patton, the poet, the historian, the bully, the sentimentalist, the great tactician and embarrassing propagandist, is shown in this haunting film to be the ultimate representative of type: the tyrant we call on to ensure defeat of the Great Tyrant. Of course, "democratic army" is an implied contradiction, and it is exactly this paradox that is examined and illustrated so brilliantly in Patton. The General knew enough about history to realize he would be harshly judged by some historians, the latter day advocates of political correctness, as he had been in his own lifetime. Of course, there is ambiguity in his character and ambivalence in people's feelings about him. (An old Warrant Officer told me he was in a military hospital in occupied German and when Patton's death was announced, half the soldiers there cried and the other half cheered.) He is hardly painted with untainted glory in this film, which captures well his self-awareness. Contrast Scott's perfectly delivered profane-glorious speech in the first innovative moments of the film with his message in the final scene when the resigned old warhorse, walking away from us into history, reminds himself and us: "All glory is fleeting." This is impeccably balanced work by writers North and Coppola, with superb directing by Schaffner, backed throughout by Goldsmith's alternately triumphant and plaintive score. Listen to the recurring "distant trumpets" (echoed in Saving Private Ryan). Patton is a classic.

    George C. Scott stars as General George Patton, legendary tank commander that traces his career through his North Africa campaign, the invasion of Germany, and finally commander of occupational forces in Germany. It also profiles his friend and colleague General Omar Bradley(Karl Malden, also superb) who tries in vain to influence Patton to not be so unforgiving to his own men(especially in memorable scene of him slapping an unhappy soldier, likely suffering from post-traumatic-stress disorder, an undiagnosed condition at that time) and his rebellious nature toward authority(when he believes it to be wrong) which threatened his own command, and any political aspirations he may have had, which he claimed were none. Superbly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, intelligently scripted and impressively mounted battles is a textbook case on how to do a film biography. This ranks as one of the best.

    Although I think George C Scott is a great actor, I do not understand why this film won 7 Oscars when several superb historic war films also produced in 1970 received little acclaim. This is yet another of the almost limitless American films post WW2 which glorifies one of their famous generals. True it shows his vanity and cruelty as well, but as a military historian myself I really wonder why such average war scenes rated so highly? For example Patton's triumph after Kasserine is portrayed in almost laughable battles-scenes. We have modern M60 tanks (ironically the "Patton") with black crosses on the side pretending to be German tanks and German infantry marching in Napoleonic dense columns towards the US Army. Its incredibly bad even by the standard of the time (and Gen Bradley was the military adviser?). I do like the acting in the film. I think George C Scott is great and well deserves the accolades. But I do wonder why the outstanding films "Waterloo" and "Cromwell" shown also in 1970 did not receive wide acclaim, despite being in my opinion some of the best films ever put on film. Waterloo is probably the most impressive cinematic representation of a historic battle ever made - never again will a film be made like this. I can't help but think it does help if your film is about an American war hero, with famous American actors for Americans (like almost every successful film that has been made in the English speaking world since 1945). Interesting that a Bridge to Far which has faultless battle scenes and outstanding moving acting did not receive anything like 7 Oscars! I wonder why?

    Fascinating Character Study, Oscar Winner (He refused it) George C. Scott gives a Universally praised Performance that is without doubt the best part of this Academy Award 7 Time Winner. The Script is also a significant achievement weaving Pro and Anti War sentiments effortlessly. There are so many quotable lines...here is one..."Compared to War, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance" That is a summation of Patton and the Movie does give a slightly Romantic vision of the most Controversial, Flamboyant, and Charismatic Military Leader of His Era. In contrast, Eisenhower barely had a Heartbeat and was dull and humorless. The Film is Framed and Shot entirely from Patton's point of view. The Battles are shown mostly in Wide Shots and the carnage is only glimpsed after the fact. The Deaths and suffering of the Soldiers underneath this self identified Demi-God are to Him like Players on a Stage or Pawns in a Game. He was eccentric, to say the least, and fancied Himself a Man with a Destiny. He believed in Reincarnation. But this often alluded to Spiritual Belief, is shown to be insincere when after He is told that the Future of War will be pushbutton He states..."Thank God I won't be around to see it". But most of the Movie is consistent in its telling of this Larger Than Life, frightening, Dictator Wannabe and it gives the sense that this unhinged Man would not be much different than the Evil Despots who were the Enemy. Overall, it is an Overrated Film but is quite good and worth watching as a Dramatic representation of an Egomaniac, who like most of His ilk, left to their own devices, would more than likely cause more harm than good. Having this Man with His hand on the button is a very dangerous thing. Reference Scott's Role as an Air Force General in Dr. Strangelove (1964). That could be Patton Reincarnated.

    Overblown docu-drama about the boorish army general plastically played by George Scott. I've found that movie-goers really don't know anything about film-making or acting, so their opinions are often overkill in praise. Big productions sucker most folks into believing a film is a lot better than it actually is, the same way a terrible actor can get rave reviews just because he did a role in which he had little dialogue accompanied with an abundance of serious frowns. Any hack director (in this case, Frank Schaffner) can make a movie appear 'extraordinary' with the mechanical slight of hand found here, starting with a long running-time so he can bring the story to the proverbial snail's crawl by interjecting time-consuming pans of landscape and wannabe-poignant shreds of empty dialogue, most of it by Scott as he waxes poetic while concomitantly striking pretentious poses. Just another war film, this one painted in American Neon, concomitantly salted with Scott's glazed ham performance. I'm an Ivy League grad from Penn and I still sat through this pomp and circumstance for almost three hours.... wow, I must have been really bored that day.

    George C Scott dominates this film in a memorable portrayal of US General Patton. Once in a lifetime can an actor get such an opportunity. Mr. Scott brings General Patton to life in a bravura performance. FrankliN Schaffner was a fine Director and he guises the film brilliantly but it is George C Scott who gives one of the greatest male performances I have ever seen. As we all know, Mr. Scott refused the Oscar for which he so richly earned. A fine supporting cast in this 20th Century Fox film which was a smash hit.

    Here's a sto-ry..... of an ego-tis-ti-cal general. C. Scott George - or whatever his name is - tries to capture the fierceness of the pretentious World War II field commander by attempting to sound 'gruff' - of course, Scott always sounded that way. A film quite over-rated, even when it was first released in 1970 (1970! Was that even a real year?). Film is long and mostly boring, only coming to life during the few and far between battle scenes. Ironically, Karl Malden may have offered his best performance here (which isn't saying much, because he was a terrible actor). 3 stars for pomp and circumstance.

    I am a retired history teacher and am insufferable to be with if you are watching a historical picture. I tend to notice all the mistakes--making "Pocahontas", "The Sound of Music" and "Midway" (as examples) films you would hate to watch with me. I cannot help but should out 'these films are FILLED with glaring errors--what's WRONG with these people?!?!'--and you will no doubt hate me for it! But, "Patton" is a rare example where I won't complain. Sure, many of the tanks are NOT WWII vintage and a few facts here and there aren't exactly correct. BUT, the sheer force of George C. Scott's portrayal make the film riveting from start to finish. A truly exceptional film and a film which CLEARLY earned Scott the Oscar he ultimately refused! See this film but do NOT see the sequel that was made for TV a decade or so later--it is simply awful and pointless!

    A few random thoughts: 1. The great broadcaster Walter Cronkite, who covered Patton during the war, felt this film captured the man extremely well. 2. My favorite scene in the movies, any movie, is where Patton looks out over the ancient battlefield (Rome vs. Carthage), the music flares gently, he describes the battle in a few succinct sentences, pauses, and says, "I was here." 2a. My favorite sequence in the movies, any movie, is Patton's pivot north to relieve Bastogne, from the first stirrings of enemy activity in the Ardennes Forest to the chaplain's successful prayer for good weather. 3. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) comes off very well in the movie. This may be historically inaccurate. The excellent military historian Victor Davis Hanson, in his 1999 book "The Soul of Battle," rips apart Bradley for his bureaucratic timidity (he does the same for Ike) and praises Patton to the skies. Davis' writing on Patton is splendid. 4. I like how the movie leaves implicit, rather than making explicit, a central fact: Patton's pursuit of military glory was in congruence with America's best interests in the war. There was no conflict whatsoever between him needing to be great and America's need to win; in fact, his ambition fueled our victory. 5. President Nixon reportedly watched this film a number of times before the invasion of Cambodia. When I was a kid I scoffed at this. Oddly enough, the older I get, the more I understand it. Not the invasion. The watching of the movie to brace himself for a massive task. 6. The script is really good. It takes a massive, sprawling topic and makes it manageable and fascinating. A well deserved Oscar for Francis Ford Coppola.

    Sometimes in life, a human being may have unlikable qualities, yet still be extremely likable in spite of all that. George C. Scott and General George Patton shared both of those qualities, so how ironic to have them associated together through this Oscar Winning Best Film. This is one time in watching a movie where it does help to know a little something not only about the character the leading man is playing, but the leading man himself. With his raspy voice, not quite leading man physical looks and a controversial off-screen image, George C. Scott is a most fascinating actor because in spite of everything, you can't help but like him. In playing one of America's most controversial World War II figures, Scott gave a solid performance that is captivating even when he is being less than kind to the people who are serving under him. Even if he just appeared in a short covering the opening sequence (the classic speech in front of the giant American flag), Scott would have entered screen immortality. But there's another three hours after that amazing sequence (which screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola claims almost got him fired off this project), and that is three hours of solid entertainment. Any man who can use the Lord's name in vain while professing his belief in God is a fascinating character to watch, whether you agree with how he feels or not. When Scott attacks a soldier on the verge of a nervous breakdown in front of the wounded in the hospital, you sense both his compassion (for the wounded) and the reasons for his anger at the soldier he humiliates. This isn't a war epic about amazing battle scenes, although the strategies that Patton reveals are very interesting. When Scott is off screen, you will be riveted to the sequences where Nazi officers reveal aspects of Patton they have discovered themselves to their amusement. The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't.

When Scott is off screen, you will be riveted to the sequences where Nazi officers reveal aspects of Patton they have discovered themselves to their amusement. The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't. Karl Malden offers solid support as Patton's right hand man, perhaps the only man who truly understands him and accepts him for who he is. The ending reminded me of the final scene between Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains in "Casablanca".

    The critics who dismiss this film as bad primarily because it is pro-American seem blinded to the probability that it's the most complex and artful film representation of the fierce pride and nagging problems that come with commanding any army of a democracy in a great war. (Perhaps their ancestors who served in that democratic army, or who were liberated in their millions by 20th century American soldiers, would be less inclined to condemn this portrayal of those soldiers and their leaders.) In any case, Patton, the poet, the historian, the bully, the sentimentalist, the great tactician and embarrassing propagandist, is shown in this haunting film to be the ultimate representative of type: the tyrant we call on to ensure defeat of the Great Tyrant. Of course, "democratic army" is an implied contradiction, and it is exactly this paradox that is examined and illustrated so brilliantly in Patton. The General knew enough about history to realize he would be harshly judged by some historians, the latter day advocates of political correctness, as he had been in his own lifetime. Of course, there is ambiguity in his character and ambivalence in people's feelings about him. (An old Warrant Officer told me he was in a military hospital in occupied German and when Patton's death was announced, half the soldiers there cried and the other half cheered.) He is hardly painted with untainted glory in this film, which captures well his self-awareness. Contrast Scott's perfectly delivered profane-glorious speech in the first innovative moments of the film with his message in the final scene when the resigned old warhorse, walking away from us into history, reminds himself and us: "All glory is fleeting." This is impeccably balanced work by writers North and Coppola, with superb directing by Schaffner, backed throughout by Goldsmith's alternately triumphant and plaintive score. Listen to the recurring "distant trumpets" (echoed in Saving Private Ryan). Patton is a classic.

    George C. Scott stars as General George Patton, legendary tank commander that traces his career through his North Africa campaign, the invasion of Germany, and finally commander of occupational forces in Germany. It also profiles his friend and colleague General Omar Bradley(Karl Malden, also superb) who tries in vain to influence Patton to not be so unforgiving to his own men(especially in memorable scene of him slapping an unhappy soldier, likely suffering from post-traumatic-stress disorder, an undiagnosed condition at that time) and his rebellious nature toward authority(when he believes it to be wrong) which threatened his own command, and any political aspirations he may have had, which he claimed were none. Superbly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, intelligently scripted and impressively mounted battles is a textbook case on how to do a film biography. This ranks as one of the best.

    Although I think George C Scott is a great actor, I do not understand why this film won 7 Oscars when several superb historic war films also produced in 1970 received little acclaim. This is yet another of the almost limitless American films post WW2 which glorifies one of their famous generals. True it shows his vanity and cruelty as well, but as a military historian myself I really wonder why such average war scenes rated so highly? For example Patton's triumph after Kasserine is portrayed in almost laughable battles-scenes. We have modern M60 tanks (ironically the "Patton") with black crosses on the side pretending to be German tanks and German infantry marching in Napoleonic dense columns towards the US Army. Its incredibly bad even by the standard of the time (and Gen Bradley was the military adviser?). I do like the acting in the film. I think George C Scott is great and well deserves the accolades. But I do wonder why the outstanding films "Waterloo" and "Cromwell" shown also in 1970 did not receive wide acclaim, despite being in my opinion some of the best films ever put on film. Waterloo is probably the most impressive cinematic representation of a historic battle ever made - never again will a film be made like this. I can't help but think it does help if your film is about an American war hero, with famous American actors for Americans (like almost every successful film that has been made in the English speaking world since 1945). Interesting that a Bridge to Far which has faultless battle scenes and outstanding moving acting did not receive anything like 7 Oscars! I wonder why?

    Fascinating Character Study, Oscar Winner (He refused it) George C. Scott gives a Universally praised Performance that is without doubt the best part of this Academy Award 7 Time Winner. The Script is also a significant achievement weaving Pro and Anti War sentiments effortlessly. There are so many quotable lines...here is one..."Compared to War, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance" That is a summation of Patton and the Movie does give a slightly Romantic vision of the most Controversial, Flamboyant, and Charismatic Military Leader of His Era. In contrast, Eisenhower barely had a Heartbeat and was dull and humorless. The Film is Framed and Shot entirely from Patton's point of view. The Battles are shown mostly in Wide Shots and the carnage is only glimpsed after the fact. The Deaths and suffering of the Soldiers underneath this self identified Demi-God are to Him like Players on a Stage or Pawns in a Game. He was eccentric, to say the least, and fancied Himself a Man with a Destiny. He believed in Reincarnation. But this often alluded to Spiritual Belief, is shown to be insincere when after He is told that the Future of War will be pushbutton He states..."Thank God I won't be around to see it". But most of the Movie is consistent in its telling of this Larger Than Life, frightening, Dictator Wannabe and it gives the sense that this unhinged Man would not be much different than the Evil Despots who were the Enemy. Overall, it is an Overrated Film but is quite good and worth watching as a Dramatic representation of an Egomaniac, who like most of His ilk, left to their own devices, would more than likely cause more harm than good. Having this Man with His hand on the button is a very dangerous thing. Reference Scott's Role as an Air Force General in Dr. Strangelove (1964). That could be Patton Reincarnated.

    Overblown docu-drama about the boorish army general plastically played by George Scott. I've found that movie-goers really don't know anything about film-making or acting, so their opinions are often overkill in praise. Big productions sucker most folks into believing a film is a lot better than it actually is, the same way a terrible actor can get rave reviews just because he did a role in which he had little dialogue accompanied with an abundance of serious frowns. Any hack director (in this case, Frank Schaffner) can make a movie appear 'extraordinary' with the mechanical slight of hand found here, starting with a long running-time so he can bring the story to the proverbial snail's crawl by interjecting time-consuming pans of landscape and wannabe-poignant shreds of empty dialogue, most of it by Scott as he waxes poetic while concomitantly striking pretentious poses. Just another war film, this one painted in American Neon, concomitantly salted with Scott's glazed ham performance. I'm an Ivy League grad from Penn and I still sat through this pomp and circumstance for almost three hours.... wow, I must have been really bored that day.

    George C Scott dominates this film in a memorable portrayal of US General Patton. Once in a lifetime can an actor get such an opportunity. Mr. Scott brings General Patton to life in a bravura performance. FrankliN Schaffner was a fine Director and he guises the film brilliantly but it is George C Scott who gives one of the greatest male performances I have ever seen. As we all know, Mr. Scott refused the Oscar for which he so richly earned. A fine supporting cast in this 20th Century Fox film which was a smash hit.

    Here's a sto-ry..... of an ego-tis-ti-cal general. C. Scott George - or whatever his name is - tries to capture the fierceness of the pretentious World War II field commander by attempting to sound 'gruff' - of course, Scott always sounded that way. A film quite over-rated, even when it was first released in 1970 (1970! Was that even a real year?). Film is long and mostly boring, only coming to life during the few and far between battle scenes. Ironically, Karl Malden may have offered his best performance here (which isn't saying much, because he was a terrible actor). 3 stars for pomp and circumstance.

    I am a retired history teacher and am insufferable to be with if you are watching a historical picture. I tend to notice all the mistakes--making "Pocahontas", "The Sound of Music" and "Midway" (as examples) films you would hate to watch with me. I cannot help but should out 'these films are FILLED with glaring errors--what's WRONG with these people?!?!'--and you will no doubt hate me for it! But, "Patton" is a rare example where I won't complain. Sure, many of the tanks are NOT WWII vintage and a few facts here and there aren't exactly correct. BUT, the sheer force of George C. Scott's portrayal make the film riveting from start to finish. A truly exceptional film and a film which CLEARLY earned Scott the Oscar he ultimately refused! See this film but do NOT see the sequel that was made for TV a decade or so later--it is simply awful and pointless!

    A few random thoughts: 1. The great broadcaster Walter Cronkite, who covered Patton during the war, felt this film captured the man extremely well. 2. My favorite scene in the movies, any movie, is where Patton looks out over the ancient battlefield (Rome vs. Carthage), the music flares gently, he describes the battle in a few succinct sentences, pauses, and says, "I was here." 2a. My favorite sequence in the movies, any movie, is Patton's pivot north to relieve Bastogne, from the first stirrings of enemy activity in the Ardennes Forest to the chaplain's successful prayer for good weather. 3. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) comes off very well in the movie. This may be historically inaccurate. The excellent military historian Victor Davis Hanson, in his 1999 book "The Soul of Battle," rips apart Bradley for his bureaucratic timidity (he does the same for Ike) and praises Patton to the skies. Davis' writing on Patton is splendid. 4. I like how the movie leaves implicit, rather than making explicit, a central fact: Patton's pursuit of military glory was in congruence with America's best interests in the war. There was no conflict whatsoever between him needing to be great and America's need to win; in fact, his ambition fueled our victory. 5. President Nixon reportedly watched this film a number of times before the invasion of Cambodia. When I was a kid I scoffed at this. Oddly enough, the older I get, the more I understand it. Not the invasion. The watching of the movie to brace himself for a massive task. 6. The script is really good. It takes a massive, sprawling topic and makes it manageable and fascinating. A well deserved Oscar for Francis Ford Coppola.

    Sometimes in life, a human being may have unlikable qualities, yet still be extremely likable in spite of all that. George C. Scott and General George Patton shared both of those qualities, so how ironic to have them associated together through this Oscar Winning Best Film. This is one time in watching a movie where it does help to know a little something not only about the character the leading man is playing, but the leading man himself. With his raspy voice, not quite leading man physical looks and a controversial off-screen image, George C. Scott is a most fascinating actor because in spite of everything, you can't help but like him. In playing one of America's most controversial World War II figures, Scott gave a solid performance that is captivating even when he is being less than kind to the people who are serving under him. Even if he just appeared in a short covering the opening sequence (the classic speech in front of the giant American flag), Scott would have entered screen immortality. But there's another three hours after that amazing sequence (which screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola claims almost got him fired off this project), and that is three hours of solid entertainment. Any man who can use the Lord's name in vain while professing his belief in God is a fascinating character to watch, whether you agree with how he feels or not. When Scott attacks a soldier on the verge of a nervous breakdown in front of the wounded in the hospital, you sense both his compassion (for the wounded) and the reasons for his anger at the soldier he humiliates. This isn't a war epic about amazing battle scenes, although the strategies that Patton reveals are very interesting. When Scott is off screen, you will be riveted to the sequences where Nazi officers reveal aspects of Patton they have discovered themselves to their amusement. The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't.

When Scott attacks a soldier on the verge of a nervous breakdown in front of the wounded in the hospital, you sense both his compassion (for the wounded) and the reasons for his anger at the soldier he humiliates. This isn't a war epic about amazing battle scenes, although the strategies that Patton reveals are very interesting. When Scott is off screen, you will be riveted to the sequences where Nazi officers reveal aspects of Patton they have discovered themselves to their amusement. The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't. Karl Malden offers solid support as Patton's right hand man, perhaps the only man who truly understands him and accepts him for who he is. The ending reminded me of the final scene between Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains in "Casablanca".

    The critics who dismiss this film as bad primarily because it is pro-American seem blinded to the probability that it's the most complex and artful film representation of the fierce pride and nagging problems that come with commanding any army of a democracy in a great war. (Perhaps their ancestors who served in that democratic army, or who were liberated in their millions by 20th century American soldiers, would be less inclined to condemn this portrayal of those soldiers and their leaders.) In any case, Patton, the poet, the historian, the bully, the sentimentalist, the great tactician and embarrassing propagandist, is shown in this haunting film to be the ultimate representative of type: the tyrant we call on to ensure defeat of the Great Tyrant. Of course, "democratic army" is an implied contradiction, and it is exactly this paradox that is examined and illustrated so brilliantly in Patton. The General knew enough about history to realize he would be harshly judged by some historians, the latter day advocates of political correctness, as he had been in his own lifetime. Of course, there is ambiguity in his character and ambivalence in people's feelings about him. (An old Warrant Officer told me he was in a military hospital in occupied German and when Patton's death was announced, half the soldiers there cried and the other half cheered.) He is hardly painted with untainted glory in this film, which captures well his self-awareness. Contrast Scott's perfectly delivered profane-glorious speech in the first innovative moments of the film with his message in the final scene when the resigned old warhorse, walking away from us into history, reminds himself and us: "All glory is fleeting." This is impeccably balanced work by writers North and Coppola, with superb directing by Schaffner, backed throughout by Goldsmith's alternately triumphant and plaintive score. Listen to the recurring "distant trumpets" (echoed in Saving Private Ryan). Patton is a classic.

    George C. Scott stars as General George Patton, legendary tank commander that traces his career through his North Africa campaign, the invasion of Germany, and finally commander of occupational forces in Germany. It also profiles his friend and colleague General Omar Bradley(Karl Malden, also superb) who tries in vain to influence Patton to not be so unforgiving to his own men(especially in memorable scene of him slapping an unhappy soldier, likely suffering from post-traumatic-stress disorder, an undiagnosed condition at that time) and his rebellious nature toward authority(when he believes it to be wrong) which threatened his own command, and any political aspirations he may have had, which he claimed were none. Superbly directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, intelligently scripted and impressively mounted battles is a textbook case on how to do a film biography. This ranks as one of the best.

    Although I think George C Scott is a great actor, I do not understand why this film won 7 Oscars when several superb historic war films also produced in 1970 received little acclaim. This is yet another of the almost limitless American films post WW2 which glorifies one of their famous generals. True it shows his vanity and cruelty as well, but as a military historian myself I really wonder why such average war scenes rated so highly? For example Patton's triumph after Kasserine is portrayed in almost laughable battles-scenes. We have modern M60 tanks (ironically the "Patton") with black crosses on the side pretending to be German tanks and German infantry marching in Napoleonic dense columns towards the US Army. Its incredibly bad even by the standard of the time (and Gen Bradley was the military adviser?). I do like the acting in the film. I think George C Scott is great and well deserves the accolades. But I do wonder why the outstanding films "Waterloo" and "Cromwell" shown also in 1970 did not receive wide acclaim, despite being in my opinion some of the best films ever put on film. Waterloo is probably the most impressive cinematic representation of a historic battle ever made - never again will a film be made like this. I can't help but think it does help if your film is about an American war hero, with famous American actors for Americans (like almost every successful film that has been made in the English speaking world since 1945). Interesting that a Bridge to Far which has faultless battle scenes and outstanding moving acting did not receive anything like 7 Oscars! I wonder why?

    Fascinating Character Study, Oscar Winner (He refused it) George C. Scott gives a Universally praised Performance that is without doubt the best part of this Academy Award 7 Time Winner. The Script is also a significant achievement weaving Pro and Anti War sentiments effortlessly. There are so many quotable lines...here is one..."Compared to War, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance" That is a summation of Patton and the Movie does give a slightly Romantic vision of the most Controversial, Flamboyant, and Charismatic Military Leader of His Era. In contrast, Eisenhower barely had a Heartbeat and was dull and humorless. The Film is Framed and Shot entirely from Patton's point of view. The Battles are shown mostly in Wide Shots and the carnage is only glimpsed after the fact. The Deaths and suffering of the Soldiers underneath this self identified Demi-God are to Him like Players on a Stage or Pawns in a Game. He was eccentric, to say the least, and fancied Himself a Man with a Destiny. He believed in Reincarnation. But this often alluded to Spiritual Belief, is shown to be insincere when after He is told that the Future of War will be pushbutton He states..."Thank God I won't be around to see it". But most of the Movie is consistent in its telling of this Larger Than Life, frightening, Dictator Wannabe and it gives the sense that this unhinged Man would not be much different than the Evil Despots who were the Enemy. Overall, it is an Overrated Film but is quite good and worth watching as a Dramatic representation of an Egomaniac, who like most of His ilk, left to their own devices, would more than likely cause more harm than good. Having this Man with His hand on the button is a very dangerous thing. Reference Scott's Role as an Air Force General in Dr. Strangelove (1964). That could be Patton Reincarnated.

    Overblown docu-drama about the boorish army general plastically played by George Scott. I've found that movie-goers really don't know anything about film-making or acting, so their opinions are often overkill in praise. Big productions sucker most folks into believing a film is a lot better than it actually is, the same way a terrible actor can get rave reviews just because he did a role in which he had little dialogue accompanied with an abundance of serious frowns. Any hack director (in this case, Frank Schaffner) can make a movie appear 'extraordinary' with the mechanical slight of hand found here, starting with a long running-time so he can bring the story to the proverbial snail's crawl by interjecting time-consuming pans of landscape and wannabe-poignant shreds of empty dialogue, most of it by Scott as he waxes poetic while concomitantly striking pretentious poses. Just another war film, this one painted in American Neon, concomitantly salted with Scott's glazed ham performance. I'm an Ivy League grad from Penn and I still sat through this pomp and circumstance for almost three hours.... wow, I must have been really bored that day.

    George C Scott dominates this film in a memorable portrayal of US General Patton. Once in a lifetime can an actor get such an opportunity. Mr. Scott brings General Patton to life in a bravura performance. FrankliN Schaffner was a fine Director and he guises the film brilliantly but it is George C Scott who gives one of the greatest male performances I have ever seen. As we all know, Mr. Scott refused the Oscar for which he so richly earned. A fine supporting cast in this 20th Century Fox film which was a smash hit.

    Here's a sto-ry..... of an ego-tis-ti-cal general. C. Scott George - or whatever his name is - tries to capture the fierceness of the pretentious World War II field commander by attempting to sound 'gruff' - of course, Scott always sounded that way. A film quite over-rated, even when it was first released in 1970 (1970! Was that even a real year?). Film is long and mostly boring, only coming to life during the few and far between battle scenes. Ironically, Karl Malden may have offered his best performance here (which isn't saying much, because he was a terrible actor). 3 stars for pomp and circumstance.

    I am a retired history teacher and am insufferable to be with if you are watching a historical picture. I tend to notice all the mistakes--making "Pocahontas", "The Sound of Music" and "Midway" (as examples) films you would hate to watch with me. I cannot help but should out 'these films are FILLED with glaring errors--what's WRONG with these people?!?!'--and you will no doubt hate me for it! But, "Patton" is a rare example where I won't complain. Sure, many of the tanks are NOT WWII vintage and a few facts here and there aren't exactly correct. BUT, the sheer force of George C. Scott's portrayal make the film riveting from start to finish. A truly exceptional film and a film which CLEARLY earned Scott the Oscar he ultimately refused! See this film but do NOT see the sequel that was made for TV a decade or so later--it is simply awful and pointless!

    A few random thoughts: 1. The great broadcaster Walter Cronkite, who covered Patton during the war, felt this film captured the man extremely well. 2. My favorite scene in the movies, any movie, is where Patton looks out over the ancient battlefield (Rome vs. Carthage), the music flares gently, he describes the battle in a few succinct sentences, pauses, and says, "I was here." 2a. My favorite sequence in the movies, any movie, is Patton's pivot north to relieve Bastogne, from the first stirrings of enemy activity in the Ardennes Forest to the chaplain's successful prayer for good weather. 3. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) comes off very well in the movie. This may be historically inaccurate. The excellent military historian Victor Davis Hanson, in his 1999 book "The Soul of Battle," rips apart Bradley for his bureaucratic timidity (he does the same for Ike) and praises Patton to the skies. Davis' writing on Patton is splendid. 4. I like how the movie leaves implicit, rather than making explicit, a central fact: Patton's pursuit of military glory was in congruence with America's best interests in the war. There was no conflict whatsoever between him needing to be great and America's need to win; in fact, his ambition fueled our victory. 5. President Nixon reportedly watched this film a number of times before the invasion of Cambodia. When I was a kid I scoffed at this. Oddly enough, the older I get, the more I understand it. Not the invasion. The watching of the movie to brace himself for a massive task. 6. The script is really good. It takes a massive, sprawling topic and makes it manageable and fascinating. A well deserved Oscar for Francis Ford Coppola.

    Sometimes in life, a human being may have unlikable qualities, yet still be extremely likable in spite of all that. George C. Scott and General George Patton shared both of those qualities, so how ironic to have them associated together through this Oscar Winning Best Film. This is one time in watching a movie where it does help to know a little something not only about the character the leading man is playing, but the leading man himself. With his raspy voice, not quite leading man physical looks and a controversial off-screen image, George C. Scott is a most fascinating actor because in spite of everything, you can't help but like him. In playing one of America's most controversial World War II figures, Scott gave a solid performance that is captivating even when he is being less than kind to the people who are serving under him. Even if he just appeared in a short covering the opening sequence (the classic speech in front of the giant American flag), Scott would have entered screen immortality. But there's another three hours after that amazing sequence (which screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola claims almost got him fired off this project), and that is three hours of solid entertainment.

Any man who can use the Lord's name in vain while professing his belief in God is a fascinating character to watch, whether you agree with how he feels or not. When Scott attacks a soldier on the verge of a nervous breakdown in front of the wounded in the hospital, you sense both his compassion (for the wounded) and the reasons for his anger at the soldier he humiliates. This isn't a war epic about amazing battle scenes, although the strategies that Patton reveals are very interesting. When Scott is off screen, you will be riveted to the sequences where Nazi officers reveal aspects of Patton they have discovered themselves to their amusement. The relationship between Patton and British war hero Douglas Montgomery is also fascinating, a battle of two Prima Dona's who know they want glory, although Patton adds that he's willing to admit it, even if Montgomery (a subject of several war films himself) isn't. Karl Malden offers solid support as Patton's right hand man, perhaps the only man who truly understands him and accepts him for who he is. The ending reminded me of the final scene between Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains in "Casablanca".

    The critics who dismiss this film as bad primarily because it is pro-American seem blinded to the probability that it's the most complex and artful film representation of the fierce pride and nagging problems that come with commanding any army of a democracy in a great war. (Perhaps their ancestors who served in that democratic army, or who were liberated in their millions by 20th century American soldiers, would be less inclined to condemn this portrayal of those soldiers and their leaders.) In any case, Patton, the poet, the historian, the bully, the sentimentalist, the great tactician and embarrassing propagandist, is shown in this haunting film to be the ultimate representative of type: the tyrant we call on to ensure defeat of the Great Tyrant. Of course, "democratic army" is an implied contradiction, and it is exactly this paradox that is examined and illustrated so brilliantly in Patton. The General knew enough about history to realize he would be harshly judged by some historians, the latter day advocates of political correctness, as he had been in his own lifetime. Of course, there is ambiguity in his character and ambivalence in people's feelings about him. (An old Warrant Officer told me he was in a military hospital in occupied German and when Patton's death was announced, half the soldiers there cried and the other half cheered.) He is hardly painted with untainted glory in this film, which captures well his self-awareness. Contrast Scott's perfectly delivered profane-glorious speech in the first innovative moments of the film with his message in the final scene when the resigned old warhorse, walking away from us into history, reminds himself and us: "All glory is fleeting." This is impeccably balanced work by writers North and Coppola, with superb directing by Schaffner, backed throughout by Goldsmith's alternately triumphant and plaintive score. Listen to the recurring "distant trumpets" (echoed in Saving Private Ryan). Patton is a classic.
