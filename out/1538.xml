    Personally, I find this a very good movie in the way how it handles the subjects love, friendship, argue, sadness and violence. There are also lesbian and gay characters in it. It's a good and realistic story and I think it can help some young lesbian and gay persons if they watch this movie. It's for anyone good to watch this. Alison Folland (I'm a big fan of hers) plays Claude. She is in love with her friend Ellen. Ellen on the other hand is dating Mark but he don't care (much) about her and helps her taking drugs. He is also busy with criminal activities. Claude finds it difficult to see Ellen with him because of her feelings and later on she finds out more and more that he is a bad person. The friendship between Claude and Ellen first is kinda special but later on they get argue because Ellen is very much influenced by Mark. There is also a murder in the story. It's someone Claude knows and it effects her as well. At some moment, Claude meets Lucy, a girl in a music store. They like each other but don't talk yet. Later on someone says that she should try a certain bar so that she can meet people there. In that bar are playing girl bands. She does and finds Lucy again by some lucky chance! I won't tell you how the movie continues because it's nicer for you if you watch it yourself! Also, I find the music good and I think it suits the story. And by looking at the clothing of the characters we can see that the weather is warm.

    by far one of the best coming of age films i've seen in a long time. deals with the trial and tribulations of teenager claude and her best friend ellen and follows their daily lives in hell's kitchen. claude clearly holds a torch for ellen who has an attraction to a local street thug named mark. claude eventually meets up with a local musician and cutie named lucy played leisha hailey of the l word fame. i liked how the relationship was developed and portrayed between between lucy and claude. the awkwardness and pangs of first love. the soundtrack to the film also kicked some serious ass as it used a lot of indie artists and girl bands from the nineties. definitely a keeper.

    Alison Folland is a young woman in a shabby section of New York who, after a tempestuous friendship with blond, impatient Tara Subkoff, and the murder of her gay buddy Luke, comes to terms with her own lesbianism and finds a happy and accommodating partner in Lucy, a band leader in a place that looks like the Swing Rendezvous in the Village used to look. Maybe that makes it sound more complicated than it is. It's really a rather simple movie, a little pedantic, a delicate character study rather than a mystery or action movie. Roughly speaking, all the gays are good and all the straight people are messed up. That's not too hard to follow, is it? Well, there are a couple of exceptions, but not many. Don, the Italian owner of the pizza restaurant where Alison and a gay guy both work, is straight but sympathetic. He's briefly in about four scenes. But it's hard to care about Don's character one way or the other because he serves up these GREAT pizzas (we only get a glimpse but can practically smell it) that make Domino's and Pizza Hut look like impostors. Try to get a pizza like that at four in the morning in northern Scotland! The rest of the straight guys are represented by the boyfriend of Alison's mother, who, in the absence of the mother, begins dangling his insinuations in front of the girl herself, who looks about 16. The straight adolescent goons who ball Subkoff when they feel like it and throw her out when they're bored with her are little more than perambulating pustules. Folland plays a dumpy adolescent who is shy but sensitive. In fact, however, she has a splendid face with modelesque features, fey and pixie-like. Her bone structure is pretty big though and, alas, the configuration of her weight suggests a strong genetic component. There won't be much she'll be able to do about it. It shouldn't matter, but it always does. Subkoff, her inconstant adolescent friend, has a more conventional and rather skinny figure but her voice, features, and demeanor are coarser than Folland's. She looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer if Buffy were the vampire instead of the slayer. She has probably the most demanding role in the film and brings it off marvelously, a complex character very nicely rendered. The photography and location shooting are just fine. And the movie does middle-class urban dwellers a big favor. You know those young chicks you see on the streets? The ones with violently pink hair done up in a fashion resembling a tangled mop? The ones with maybe a jail-house tat around their biceps? With their clothes half drooping off and that silver ring dangling from their pipiks? Well, only some of them are dangerous stoners. Many of them are just playing with their appearance, as adolescents are want to do in all cultures, and they may be a little thoughtless but fundamentally decent people. I'd watch out for the guys though, especially if they're straight. They have a slight tendency to murder people they find offensive. At least that's what the film suggests.

    All over me is a powerful indi film that shy's away from none of themes that are all too present in reality but barely touched upon in popular cinema. Homophobia, drugs, alcohol, violence, murder, sexuality and honest friendship. The film follows 15 year old Claude (Alison Folland) and her best friend Ellen ( Tara Subkoff) as they mature and take very different paths in life. As Claude is dreaming of becoming a rock star and venturing into a tender relationship with Lucy (Leisha Hailey), Ellen gets involved in a drug fuelled relationship with a violent homophobe. Following the brutal murder of a neighbour the girls once tight bond is torn apart as they no longer understand who they are. This film illustrates the role of conscience in a confused young teens mind, whether to do the 'right' thing at risk losing the biggest person of her life or continue watching a murderer walk the streets dragging down everyone around him. The guilt of not being able to save Ellen from her downward spiral and rightfully shopping Ellen's drug dealer boyfriend to the police is eased by Lucy, who can offer Claude all of the love and affection she has been wasting on Ellen. Beautifully made, beautifully written and perfectly acted by the young stars this is a 90's classic that should be watched by any true fan of good cinema.

    New York -1990s. Claude is a teenager of our time, daughter of a divorced mother who let her face the challenges of teenage alone. Not quite alone though, since her best friend Hellen is never very far. As different in temperament as they are in appearance, sturdy, self-effacing Claude and fragile, volatile Ellen have long been at the center of each other's universe. In fact, Claude loves Hellen but does not know quite yet how to express her homosexuality. Anyway, Hellen is not gay. But with school almost over and summer in the air, Claude and Ellen have begun to discover more of the world outside Claude's room. Claude has met people like Jesse, Luke and Lucy, who seem to understand her much better than Ellen does. Meanwhile, Ellen has a new boyfriend, a macho neighborhood guy who shows signs of being violent. So much so that he participates in the murder of Luke. Over the course of a few days, events lead Claude to question, for the first time ever, her friendship with Ellen. Will she have to let go of the person she loves most in order to be happy and true to herself? Tough times, where urban teenagers become adults if they are lucky, or else end up in drugs, in prison, or deadÂ… The type of movie we would like to believe is a horror fiction, rather than a picture of our nice so-called 'civilized' society.

    All over me, by far is one of my favorite movies. The first time I saw it, I loved everything about it. It made me cry, it made me happy. What is better than that. This movie was sad, it had that sadness that makes it so awesome. It's like when you have a best friend and you love them but they don't love you, yes that hurts, yes thats sad, but that is what made the movie so good. You know. I'm looking forward to owning it on DVD, got to have it in my DVD collection and I don't own much only the movies that move and speak to me like this one. It's rare, one of kind. It's certainly clear how Cluade feels about Ellen and on Ellen's part I'm not to sure but if you watch and rewind and watch it again I think you'd know and that is just the way it is. I remember watching the movie thinking I know how Cluade feels, how she felt towards Ellen and how she cried in Lucy's room, I know that because I've been there and it's hard. Anyways such a great movie, worth every penny and all your time to watch it.

    I'm Jo-Jo from New York (Ernie is my husband and I can't erase his name from the heading!) I really loved this movie - I watch it all the time. The acting and dialogue were very natural. Having been a teenage girl myself - yes it sucks quite a lot but there are fun bits too and the film really did bring that across. I think its high time there was a sequel - are you listening Sichel sisters?! I care too much about these characters not to want to find out what happens to them. For example, I would like to see how Claude's relationship with Lucy develops, does she join Lucy's band or form one of her own, and how and when she comes out to her mother. Also, I'd like to see Social Services check into Ellen's living situation - where the hell are her parents?! Its a shame that any sequel will obviously not be able to include Luke - Pat Briggs seems to be a very talented guy and I'm surprised I haven't seen him in anything else. I love Patti Smith too! Does anyone agree with me?

    I just watched this movie and I loved it. The characters were very well depicted by this young cast. The storyline and the personal associations of the characters were sympathetic and thought provoking. The technical work and production values were first class. Everyone involved in the making of this film should be very proud of their excellent work. I hope that they all have a successful career. Before I became enlightened, I would have liked to see Mark's character come to a catastrophic end, but that wouldn't jibe with my "he has to look at himself in the mirror" philosophy. Loved the "Raggedy Anne" hair. I would highly recommend it to anyone. From a screenwriter wannabe (like half the world).

    While I do not think it was a bad made film and the acting was decent, it was not enough to hold my attention. I would not say it was a horrible movie or the worst I have ever seen, but I also do not think I would be telling people to run out and see it. The character Ellen made me want to smack her and also the girl Claude for putting up with crap from Ellen. If you look closely there are several people who have gone onto bigger and better things that are in this not so well known film. It is easy to see the inner struggle between a girl trying to grow into herself and trying to be loyal to her undeserving best friend. This is a movie anyone who has an undeserving best friend should see.

    I thought this movie was wonderful. I saw it a couple years back, and it just blew my mind. Shows people just how cruel others can be, all because of their sexual preferance. Claude sees how horrible people are, and is so afraid to be herself!! So yeah, berry good movie, go check it out

    Personally, I find this a very good movie in the way how it handles the subjects love, friendship, argue, sadness and violence. There are also lesbian and gay characters in it. It's a good and realistic story and I think it can help some young lesbian and gay persons if they watch this movie. It's for anyone good to watch this. Alison Folland (I'm a big fan of hers) plays Claude. She is in love with her friend Ellen. Ellen on the other hand is dating Mark but he don't care (much) about her and helps her taking drugs. He is also busy with criminal activities. Claude finds it difficult to see Ellen with him because of her feelings and later on she finds out more and more that he is a bad person. The friendship between Claude and Ellen first is kinda special but later on they get argue because Ellen is very much influenced by Mark. There is also a murder in the story. It's someone Claude knows and it effects her as well. At some moment, Claude meets Lucy, a girl in a music store. They like each other but don't talk yet. Later on someone says that she should try a certain bar so that she can meet people there. In that bar are playing girl bands. She does and finds Lucy again by some lucky chance! I won't tell you how the movie continues because it's nicer for you if you watch it yourself! Also, I find the music good and I think it suits the story. And by looking at the clothing of the characters we can see that the weather is warm.

    by far one of the best coming of age films i've seen in a long time. deals with the trial and tribulations of teenager claude and her best friend ellen and follows their daily lives in hell's kitchen. claude clearly holds a torch for ellen who has an attraction to a local street thug named mark. claude eventually meets up with a local musician and cutie named lucy played leisha hailey of the l word fame. i liked how the relationship was developed and portrayed between between lucy and claude. the awkwardness and pangs of first love. the soundtrack to the film also kicked some serious ass as it used a lot of indie artists and girl bands from the nineties. definitely a keeper.

    Alison Folland is a young woman in a shabby section of New York who, after a tempestuous friendship with blond, impatient Tara Subkoff, and the murder of her gay buddy Luke, comes to terms with her own lesbianism and finds a happy and accommodating partner in Lucy, a band leader in a place that looks like the Swing Rendezvous in the Village used to look. Maybe that makes it sound more complicated than it is. It's really a rather simple movie, a little pedantic, a delicate character study rather than a mystery or action movie. Roughly speaking, all the gays are good and all the straight people are messed up. That's not too hard to follow, is it? Well, there are a couple of exceptions, but not many. Don, the Italian owner of the pizza restaurant where Alison and a gay guy both work, is straight but sympathetic. He's briefly in about four scenes. But it's hard to care about Don's character one way or the other because he serves up these GREAT pizzas (we only get a glimpse but can practically smell it) that make Domino's and Pizza Hut look like impostors. Try to get a pizza like that at four in the morning in northern Scotland! The rest of the straight guys are represented by the boyfriend of Alison's mother, who, in the absence of the mother, begins dangling his insinuations in front of the girl herself, who looks about 16. The straight adolescent goons who ball Subkoff when they feel like it and throw her out when they're bored with her are little more than perambulating pustules. Folland plays a dumpy adolescent who is shy but sensitive. In fact, however, she has a splendid face with modelesque features, fey and pixie-like. Her bone structure is pretty big though and, alas, the configuration of her weight suggests a strong genetic component. There won't be much she'll be able to do about it. It shouldn't matter, but it always does. Subkoff, her inconstant adolescent friend, has a more conventional and rather skinny figure but her voice, features, and demeanor are coarser than Folland's. She looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer if Buffy were the vampire instead of the slayer. She has probably the most demanding role in the film and brings it off marvelously, a complex character very nicely rendered. The photography and location shooting are just fine. And the movie does middle-class urban dwellers a big favor. You know those young chicks you see on the streets? The ones with violently pink hair done up in a fashion resembling a tangled mop? The ones with maybe a jail-house tat around their biceps? With their clothes half drooping off and that silver ring dangling from their pipiks? Well, only some of them are dangerous stoners. Many of them are just playing with their appearance, as adolescents are want to do in all cultures, and they may be a little thoughtless but fundamentally decent people. I'd watch out for the guys though, especially if they're straight. They have a slight tendency to murder people they find offensive. At least that's what the film suggests.

    All over me is a powerful indi film that shy's away from none of themes that are all too present in reality but barely touched upon in popular cinema. Homophobia, drugs, alcohol, violence, murder, sexuality and honest friendship. The film follows 15 year old Claude (Alison Folland) and her best friend Ellen ( Tara Subkoff) as they mature and take very different paths in life. As Claude is dreaming of becoming a rock star and venturing into a tender relationship with Lucy (Leisha Hailey), Ellen gets involved in a drug fuelled relationship with a violent homophobe. Following the brutal murder of a neighbour the girls once tight bond is torn apart as they no longer understand who they are. This film illustrates the role of conscience in a confused young teens mind, whether to do the 'right' thing at risk losing the biggest person of her life or continue watching a murderer walk the streets dragging down everyone around him. The guilt of not being able to save Ellen from her downward spiral and rightfully shopping Ellen's drug dealer boyfriend to the police is eased by Lucy, who can offer Claude all of the love and affection she has been wasting on Ellen. Beautifully made, beautifully written and perfectly acted by the young stars this is a 90's classic that should be watched by any true fan of good cinema.

    New York -1990s. Claude is a teenager of our time, daughter of a divorced mother who let her face the challenges of teenage alone. Not quite alone though, since her best friend Hellen is never very far. As different in temperament as they are in appearance, sturdy, self-effacing Claude and fragile, volatile Ellen have long been at the center of each other's universe. In fact, Claude loves Hellen but does not know quite yet how to express her homosexuality. Anyway, Hellen is not gay. But with school almost over and summer in the air, Claude and Ellen have begun to discover more of the world outside Claude's room. Claude has met people like Jesse, Luke and Lucy, who seem to understand her much better than Ellen does. Meanwhile, Ellen has a new boyfriend, a macho neighborhood guy who shows signs of being violent. So much so that he participates in the murder of Luke. Over the course of a few days, events lead Claude to question, for the first time ever, her friendship with Ellen. Will she have to let go of the person she loves most in order to be happy and true to herself? Tough times, where urban teenagers become adults if they are lucky, or else end up in drugs, in prison, or deadÂ… The type of movie we would like to believe is a horror fiction, rather than a picture of our nice so-called 'civilized' society.

    All over me, by far is one of my favorite movies. The first time I saw it, I loved everything about it. It made me cry, it made me happy. What is better than that. This movie was sad, it had that sadness that makes it so awesome. It's like when you have a best friend and you love them but they don't love you, yes that hurts, yes thats sad, but that is what made the movie so good. You know. I'm looking forward to owning it on DVD, got to have it in my DVD collection and I don't own much only the movies that move and speak to me like this one. It's rare, one of kind. It's certainly clear how Cluade feels about Ellen and on Ellen's part I'm not to sure but if you watch and rewind and watch it again I think you'd know and that is just the way it is. I remember watching the movie thinking I know how Cluade feels, how she felt towards Ellen and how she cried in Lucy's room, I know that because I've been there and it's hard. Anyways such a great movie, worth every penny and all your time to watch it.

    I'm Jo-Jo from New York (Ernie is my husband and I can't erase his name from the heading!) I really loved this movie - I watch it all the time. The acting and dialogue were very natural. Having been a teenage girl myself - yes it sucks quite a lot but there are fun bits too and the film really did bring that across. I think its high time there was a sequel - are you listening Sichel sisters?! I care too much about these characters not to want to find out what happens to them. For example, I would like to see how Claude's relationship with Lucy develops, does she join Lucy's band or form one of her own, and how and when she comes out to her mother. Also, I'd like to see Social Services check into Ellen's living situation - where the hell are her parents?! Its a shame that any sequel will obviously not be able to include Luke - Pat Briggs seems to be a very talented guy and I'm surprised I haven't seen him in anything else. I love Patti Smith too! Does anyone agree with me?

    I just watched this movie and I loved it. The characters were very well depicted by this young cast. The storyline and the personal associations of the characters were sympathetic and thought provoking. The technical work and production values were first class. Everyone involved in the making of this film should be very proud of their excellent work. I hope that they all have a successful career. Before I became enlightened, I would have liked to see Mark's character come to a catastrophic end, but that wouldn't jibe with my "he has to look at himself in the mirror" philosophy. Loved the "Raggedy Anne" hair. I would highly recommend it to anyone. From a screenwriter wannabe (like half the world).

    While I do not think it was a bad made film and the acting was decent, it was not enough to hold my attention. I would not say it was a horrible movie or the worst I have ever seen, but I also do not think I would be telling people to run out and see it. The character Ellen made me want to smack her and also the girl Claude for putting up with crap from Ellen. If you look closely there are several people who have gone onto bigger and better things that are in this not so well known film. It is easy to see the inner struggle between a girl trying to grow into herself and trying to be loyal to her undeserving best friend. This is a movie anyone who has an undeserving best friend should see.

    I thought this movie was wonderful. I saw it a couple years back, and it just blew my mind. Shows people just how cruel others can be, all because of their sexual preferance. Claude sees how horrible people are, and is so afraid to be herself!! So yeah, berry good movie, go check it out

    Alison Folland is a young woman in a shabby section of New York who, after a tempestuous friendship with blond, impatient Tara Subkoff, and the murder of her gay buddy Luke, comes to terms with her own lesbianism and finds a happy and accommodating partner in Lucy, a band leader in a place that looks like the Swing Rendezvous in the Village used to look. Maybe that makes it sound more complicated than it is. It's really a rather simple movie, a little pedantic, a delicate character study rather than a mystery or action movie. Roughly speaking, all the gays are good and all the straight people are messed up. That's not too hard to follow, is it? Well, there are a couple of exceptions, but not many. Don, the Italian owner of the pizza restaurant where Alison and a gay guy both work, is straight but sympathetic. He's briefly in about four scenes. But it's hard to care about Don's character one way or the other because he serves up these GREAT pizzas (we only get a glimpse but can practically smell it) that make Domino's and Pizza Hut look like impostors. Try to get a pizza like that at four in the morning in northern Scotland! The rest of the straight guys are represented by the boyfriend of Alison's mother, who, in the absence of the mother, begins dangling his insinuations in front of the girl herself, who looks about 16. The straight adolescent goons who ball Subkoff when they feel like it and throw her out when they're bored with her are little more than perambulating pustules. Folland plays a dumpy adolescent who is shy but sensitive. In fact, however, she has a splendid face with modelesque features, fey and pixie-like. Her bone structure is pretty big though and, alas, the configuration of her weight suggests a strong genetic component. There won't be much she'll be able to do about it. It shouldn't matter, but it always does. Subkoff, her inconstant adolescent friend, has a more conventional and rather skinny figure but her voice, features, and demeanor are coarser than Folland's. She looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer if Buffy were the vampire instead of the slayer. She has probably the most demanding role in the film and brings it off marvelously, a complex character very nicely rendered. The photography and location shooting are just fine. And the movie does middle-class urban dwellers a big favor. You know those young chicks you see on the streets? The ones with violently pink hair done up in a fashion resembling a tangled mop? The ones with maybe a jail-house tat around their biceps? With their clothes half drooping off and that silver ring dangling from their pipiks? Well, only some of them are dangerous stoners. Many of them are just playing with their appearance, as adolescents are want to do in all cultures, and they may be a little thoughtless but fundamentally decent people. I'd watch out for the guys though, especially if they're straight. They have a slight tendency to murder people they find offensive. At least that's what the film suggests.

    All over me is a powerful indi film that shy's away from none of themes that are all too present in reality but barely touched upon in popular cinema. Homophobia, drugs, alcohol, violence, murder, sexuality and honest friendship. The film follows 15 year old Claude (Alison Folland) and her best friend Ellen ( Tara Subkoff) as they mature and take very different paths in life. As Claude is dreaming of becoming a rock star and venturing into a tender relationship with Lucy (Leisha Hailey), Ellen gets involved in a drug fuelled relationship with a violent homophobe. Following the brutal murder of a neighbour the girls once tight bond is torn apart as they no longer understand who they are. This film illustrates the role of conscience in a confused young teens mind, whether to do the 'right' thing at risk losing the biggest person of her life or continue watching a murderer walk the streets dragging down everyone around him. The guilt of not being able to save Ellen from her downward spiral and rightfully shopping Ellen's drug dealer boyfriend to the police is eased by Lucy, who can offer Claude all of the love and affection she has been wasting on Ellen. Beautifully made, beautifully written and perfectly acted by the young stars this is a 90's classic that should be watched by any true fan of good cinema.

    New York -1990s. Claude is a teenager of our time, daughter of a divorced mother who let her face the challenges of teenage alone. Not quite alone though, since her best friend Hellen is never very far. As different in temperament as they are in appearance, sturdy, self-effacing Claude and fragile, volatile Ellen have long been at the center of each other's universe. In fact, Claude loves Hellen but does not know quite yet how to express her homosexuality. Anyway, Hellen is not gay. But with school almost over and summer in the air, Claude and Ellen have begun to discover more of the world outside Claude's room. Claude has met people like Jesse, Luke and Lucy, who seem to understand her much better than Ellen does. Meanwhile, Ellen has a new boyfriend, a macho neighborhood guy who shows signs of being violent. So much so that he participates in the murder of Luke. Over the course of a few days, events lead Claude to question, for the first time ever, her friendship with Ellen. Will she have to let go of the person she loves most in order to be happy and true to herself? Tough times, where urban teenagers become adults if they are lucky, or else end up in drugs, in prison, or deadÂ… The type of movie we would like to believe is a horror fiction, rather than a picture of our nice so-called 'civilized' society.

    All over me, by far is one of my favorite movies. The first time I saw it, I loved everything about it. It made me cry, it made me happy. What is better than that. This movie was sad, it had that sadness that makes it so awesome. It's like when you have a best friend and you love them but they don't love you, yes that hurts, yes thats sad, but that is what made the movie so good. You know. I'm looking forward to owning it on DVD, got to have it in my DVD collection and I don't own much only the movies that move and speak to me like this one. It's rare, one of kind. It's certainly clear how Cluade feels about Ellen and on Ellen's part I'm not to sure but if you watch and rewind and watch it again I think you'd know and that is just the way it is. I remember watching the movie thinking I know how Cluade feels, how she felt towards Ellen and how she cried in Lucy's room, I know that because I've been there and it's hard. Anyways such a great movie, worth every penny and all your time to watch it.

    I'm Jo-Jo from New York (Ernie is my husband and I can't erase his name from the heading!) I really loved this movie - I watch it all the time. The acting and dialogue were very natural. Having been a teenage girl myself - yes it sucks quite a lot but there are fun bits too and the film really did bring that across. I think its high time there was a sequel - are you listening Sichel sisters?! I care too much about these characters not to want to find out what happens to them. For example, I would like to see how Claude's relationship with Lucy develops, does she join Lucy's band or form one of her own, and how and when she comes out to her mother. Also, I'd like to see Social Services check into Ellen's living situation - where the hell are her parents?! Its a shame that any sequel will obviously not be able to include Luke - Pat Briggs seems to be a very talented guy and I'm surprised I haven't seen him in anything else. I love Patti Smith too! Does anyone agree with me?

    I just watched this movie and I loved it. The characters were very well depicted by this young cast. The storyline and the personal associations of the characters were sympathetic and thought provoking. The technical work and production values were first class. Everyone involved in the making of this film should be very proud of their excellent work. I hope that they all have a successful career. Before I became enlightened, I would have liked to see Mark's character come to a catastrophic end, but that wouldn't jibe with my "he has to look at himself in the mirror" philosophy. Loved the "Raggedy Anne" hair. I would highly recommend it to anyone. From a screenwriter wannabe (like half the world).

    While I do not think it was a bad made film and the acting was decent, it was not enough to hold my attention. I would not say it was a horrible movie or the worst I have ever seen, but I also do not think I would be telling people to run out and see it. The character Ellen made me want to smack her and also the girl Claude for putting up with crap from Ellen. If you look closely there are several people who have gone onto bigger and better things that are in this not so well known film. It is easy to see the inner struggle between a girl trying to grow into herself and trying to be loyal to her undeserving best friend. This is a movie anyone who has an undeserving best friend should see.

    I thought this movie was wonderful. I saw it a couple years back, and it just blew my mind. Shows people just how cruel others can be, all because of their sexual preferance. Claude sees how horrible people are, and is so afraid to be herself!! So yeah, berry good movie, go check it out
