    Perhaps I should state at the outset that I have not read Ernest Hemingway's third novel, the 1929 classic "A Farewell to Arms," and thus can only comment on the 1932 filmization that I recently watched on DVD. Hemingway, as the story goes, actively disliked the picture, and with its relatively brief running time of 78 minutes, it's easy to imagine that a good part of the author's original was given the Hollywood glossover. (The 1957 remake, generally regarded as the inferior of the two, is yet almost twice as long!) A somewhat dated, slightly creaky affair, the film is of interest today mainly for the excellent performances turned in by its three leads and for the Oscar-winning photography of Charles Lang (his only Academy Award, despite a more-than-impressive filmography). In the picture, we meet an American ambulance driver named Frederic Henry (played by Gary Cooper), who is serving on the Italian front during WW1. A doctor friend of his, an Italian named Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), introduces him to a British nurse, Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes, riding high after her recent Oscar win for 1931's little-seen "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," and who largely forsook Hollywood after 1935, to become "The First Lady of the American Theater"). The two instantly fall in lust (American nurse Agnes von Kurowsky, Hemingway's inspiration for the Hayes character, who he'd met while injured in Italy, had rebuffed the author's amorous advances), and after Henry is wounded at the front, Catherine tends to his wounds in hospital, becoming, uh, knocked up in the process. Forced to leave her nursing group as a result, Catherine hides out in Switzerland to have her baby, alone, leading to the mother of all tear-jerking conclusions.... Released in December '32, shortly before the stifling Production Code came into being, "A Farewell to Arms" is, surprisingly, sexually frank. Catherine and Henry, scant minutes after being introduced in a hotel garden, are busily engaged in the ol' "horizontal tarantella," their randiness attributed to "the war" more than their own natural inclinations. Still, Henry tells his newfound galpal "I love you" immediately afterwards, and, as events subsequently demonstrate, he means it. Cooper and Hayes do have a certain chemistry here, although they make an odd-looking couple, with Cooper towering over his girl by a good head and a half. Much of the dialogue that they utter is of the florid, purple-prose variety, and Hayes seems to occasionally overact a tad. Also (and please don't think me a superficial pigdog here), lookswise, Hayes was far from the comeliest actress on the lot, although Rinaldi refers to Catherine as the prettiest nurse in the area. Given her plain-Jane decent looks, this instant lustful infatuation on Henry's part becomes a bit incredible; a sweeter-faced actress of the period, say Claudette Colbert, might have been a better casting choice. Cooper, with his shy smile and diffident delivery, is always ingratiating, however, and Adolphe manages to convince as an Italian doctor. (Like many folks, I have a feeling, I've long thought that Menjou was French, whereas he was actually born in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.!) Director Frank Borzage, who would go on to work with Cooper in the 1936 Marlene Dietrich vehicle "Desire," does a thoroughly admirable job here, while Charles Lang certainly did earn his Oscar, especially by dint of two powerful scenes: the POV shots from Henry's moving hospital gurney, and the montage sequence of Henry's trek to find Catherine in Brissago, Switzerland. In all, a perfectly respectable film, and one that I might have appreciated a little more, had I not seen the WW1 classics "Grand Illusion" (1937) and "All Quiet on the Western Front" (1930)--two infinitely superior pictures--at NYC's Film Forum just a few weeks earlier. Still, those immortal classics are more antiwar films, whereas "A Farewell to Arms" is a romantic drama with a WW1 backdrop. The film concludes most ambiguously, with Henry proclaiming "Peace, peace" as doves fly high and the Great War ends. But whether he is praying for world peace, or peace and surcease from his tragic memories, or peace for the pitiful woman in his arms, is anybody's guess....

    In many ways Frank Borzage was the Douglas Sirk of the late twenties/early thirties churning out the same kind of fodder albeit without the gloss that Sirk was able to achieve via colour. Here Borzage weighs in with the very first adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway book - both Hems novels and short stories were eventually adapted for the screen) and on the whole he makes a decent fist of it. The novel itself was barely in the bookstores when the film was made which meant that literate filmgoers would have room to criticize the films' several departures whilst non-readers would accept it on its own terms. Leading lady Helen Hayes was primarily a stage actress - indeed so eminent was she that a Broadway Theatre was named after her - who made a late impact on the screen in Airport some thirty years after 'Farewell'. Watching the film for the first time some 80 years after its initial release I was unable to detect much real chemistry between Coop and Hayes albeit it was good to see Coop doing vulnerable, not a quality readily associated with him but if anyone walks away with the movie it is Adolph Menjou as Rinaldi, Frederic Henry's surgeon friend who, for various reasons, contrives to keep the lovers apart and even break them up. Certainly worth seeing without being memorable.

    A Farewell to Arms (1932) An unabashed over the top war romance (by Hemingway) and two young actors at the peak of their abilities. Add some really vigorous filming (some of the actions scenes in the battle are frightening and awesome), and you can see why this is such a powerful movie. There is a little sense of familiarity to this kind of story, and an old fashioned romantic flavor to it (the book is similar in outline but slightly cooler, more prosaic, more intense, more true). I think Helen Hayes is perfect but only from the director's point of view--she gave him what he wanted for this kind of high drama, and I love the performance. Gary Cooper never sits right for me--his facial twitches remain twitches, his woodenness you can knock on with your knuckles--but this is one of his best performances, alongside "High Noon." The photography by Charles Lang is really one of the highlights, and in weird way there are so many wordless part of the film, it has the strength of a great silent film with sound effects. Which pushes the burden further on the visuals. Another of the great early 1930s testaments to pure filming. Does it work in the end? Partly. But it's really sentimental, and you have to like uncomplicated emotional conflict, and resolution, complete resolution.

    Some interesting facts in a story loosely based on Hemingway's experiences, but he didn't like it. 1) Semi-autobiographical novel by Ernest Hemingway, published 1929, still in print. 2) The title is from a 16th century poem by George Peele. 3) Hemingway was an American ambulance driver for Italian army during WWI. 4) Hemingway, known for being ornery cuss had little use for people in the film industry. But he did like Cooper and they became close friends for the rest of their lives. 5) The studio shot two different endings so theater owners could pick which their audience would like best. Hemingway hated that but liked the $24k for the rights. 6) Helen Hayes, although happily married at the time had a crush on Cooper admitting in her autobiography 'like half the women in the world, I was, in the words of the Noel Coward song, "Mad about the boy."' 7) Helen Hayes, First Lady of the American Theater, was born in year 1900 in Washington D.C. a) On stage at age 5; Broadway at 9 and by age 18, she was a star. b) In 1928 she married playwright Charles MacArthur, they moved to Hollywood and she won her first Oscar for THE SIN OF MADELON CLAUDET (1931). c) She won a Tony Award the first year they were presented, in 1947, for HAPPY BIRTHDAY. d) She won Televisions Emmy award in 1952 & 1958. e) She returned to films as the Dowager Empress in ANASTASIA (1956) and won another Oscar for her role in AIRPORT (1970). f) Her son is actor James MacArthur (of HAWAII FIVE-O fame). 9) Gary Cooper born on the Montana ranch of his wealthy father, and educated in a prestigious school in England  Cooper was a rugged frontiersman with the poise of a cultured gentleman. a) Because he failed at political cartooning he sought work as a cowboy extra in movies. b) While making THE WINNING OF BARBARA WORTH movie star Clara Bow also took an interest in Cooper seeing that he was in more of her films. c) Silent films taught him how to act. d) Cooper's first talkie success was THE VIRGINIAN (1929), in which he developed the taciturn, laconic speech patterns that became fodder for every impressionist on radio, nightclubs, and television. e) Cooper alternated between tie-and-tails parts in DESIGN FOR LIVING (1933) and he-man adventurer roles in THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER (1935) for most of the 1930s. f) In 1941, he was honored with an Oscar for SERGEANT YORK, and was nominated for, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES. g) Even those co-workers who thought that Cooper wasn't exerting himself at all when filming were amazed to see how, in the final product, Cooper was actually out-acting everyone else, albeit in a subtle, unobtrusive manner. h) Some of my favorite Cooper films: MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, MEET JOHN DOE, BALL OF FIRE, FOUNTAINHEAD. i) In the 1950s he made mostly westerns like HIGH NOON, Cooper retained his box-office stature. Privately, however, he was plagued by illnesses finally dying of lung cancer in 1961. 10) Adolph Menjou, who plays Cooper's drinking buddy and an Army surgeon actually served as a captain in the Ambulance Corps for 3 years during WWI. a) Made more than 100 films moving from silent film leading man to talkies and later supporting roles. b) Menjou was Oscar nominated for THE FRONT PAGE the year before tonight's film in 1931. He played the newspaper editor later played by Cary Grant in the remake HIS GIRL Friday. c) In the 1950's Menjou was a "friendly witness" before the HUAC commission. d) His last notable film was the classic anti-war picture PATHS OF GLORY (1957) playing the villainous WWI General for director Stanley Kubrick. 11) Director Frank Borzage was one of the early major directors of Hollywood and like his contemporaries JOHN FORD, HOWARD HAWKS & KING VIDOR they all made the transition from silents to talkies but only Borzage won an Oscar as a director in both eras. His Academy Award for Best Director was for his earlier romantic WWI film, SEVENTH HEAVEN. Remade with Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones, A Farewell to Arms (1957) and as a TV miniseries with George Hamilton and Vanessa Redgrave, "A Farewell to Arms" (1966). In reality, she (the nurse) dumped Hemingway as he was 5 years younger (too young in her eyes) and she went back to the older Italian man!!! Hemingway was so hurt that when he wrote the novel he killed her off.

    Im a massive fan of these type of films! I found it here: http://www.videoarchive.talktalk.net I wasn't able to find this on DVD but was able to watch it online in excellent quality, well worth it. Old black and white ones are a favourite with my dad who is just fed up with the current rubbish that they have on TV these days - most of which are repeats. So this is easy to navigate and is a firm favourite - quite an achievement for someone of his age who is a complete technophobe. I bought him a laptop and told him it was a TV - I am hoping he doesn't find out its a computer he has been using all this time There are some others on the site too. http://www.videoarchive.talktalk.net

    This film has, at the beginning several instances of behavior that many films utilize that make me wonder if the behavior was intended by the author, director, or actor. A natural plot point was exhibited when the ambulances were going uphill & someone in back pleaded for the truck to stop because a wounded soldier was 'bleeding to death'. The ambulance could not stop because it was on a grade and stopping was impossible. This would show the cruelty of war. However, when the ambulance reaches the hospital the lieutenant in charge of the ambulance flirts with nurses before arranging for off-loading patients at the hospital. Gary Cooper, as Lieutenant Henry, does his cute-character bit while wounded soldiers are dying in the ambulances. Did the author intend for the lieutenant to behave with such cruelty? The lieutenant will later desert out of love for his wife. Maybe his whole manner is of a self-involved dandy. But the author has characters mentioning the cruelty of war all the time. But if these people are cruel also, how can they complain. The character doctor Rinaldi says something along the lines that Christians should not mind being killed, presumably because they go on to their 'reward' of heaven. Did the author write this? Did the author intend the flippant way that the doctor says it? The director shoots a shot of an uncaring lieutenant immediately after the ambulance attendant complains that a soldier is bleeding to death. Was this the intention of the author, the director (or editor) making a statement of their own. Maybe this was a decision by Gary Cooper. The nurse and lieutenant may complain about the cruelty of war, but their whole affair was the result of them volunteering to be there. Then they proceed to abandon there posts repeatedly. To me any case to be made for the importance of humanity is undermined by everybody in the 'play' lacking it. The doctor friend of Henry keeps calling Henry his baby & then proceeds to destroy his life by pushing him to alcoholism. Each character seems to say 'I'm human and it is important to be human' & then proceeds to do something cruel. Presumably, the war only ended because of exhaustion and not because of intelligent human thought. I guess what confuses me is the way the characters (or actors) work very hard, which tends to make me sympathetic to them, but when their behavior is cruel a dissonance is created.

    Frank Borzage's 1932 version of "A Farewell To Arms" has the distinction of being the first film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel. It's more Hollywood than Hemingway: Long blankets of dialogue are condensed, sharp edges softened, and the romance between Lt. Henry and Catherine made into something more befitting Douglas Sirk than the unsentimental Papa. Yet a surprising amount of the novel's spirit does survive the transition. In a story not much different than what you might have read in high school, Lt. Henry (Gary Cooper) is an American ambulance corpsman serving with the Italian Army as it fights the Austrians along the Piave, a bloody backwater campaign of World War I. Henry meets nurse Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) and they quickly fall in love. But the violence of war, and the interference of friends like Capt. Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), threaten to tear them apart. The differences between book and movie are more in the matter of treatment than storyline. When Catherine and Lt. Henry first meet, they talk about her former lover, a war casualty. In the film, she says "If I had to do it all over again, I'd marry him". In the book, though, Catherine wasn't regretting sending him off to war unmarried, but without their having had sex. Yet a minute later, her lines come directly from the book, Catherine noting her daydreams about her old lover turning up at her hospital with a saber cut, then adding: "He didn't have a saber cut, they blew him to bits." For Hollywood, violence was always easier material than sex. Since this is a film made before the inhibiting Hays Code (Will, not Helen), Borzage and his writers are able to get away with a bit more than they would have just a couple of years later. Catherine and Henry still make love, and she gets pregnant. There IS a lot of Hemingway here. Catherine is a still somewhat mixed-up woman who hates the rain "because I see myself dead in it". The folly of war is openly expressed. "If nobody would attack, the war would be over," one soldier muses. Lt. Henry is wounded, and embarrassed because it happened while he was eating cheese. Even some small exchanges survive, like one between Lt. Henry and a nasty nurse. She: "Pity is wasted on you." He: "Thank you." But the film also strikes out for its own territory, successfully in the case of building up the role of Capt. Rinaldi. Menjou, who had been a real ambulance corps captain in World War I, creates a marvelously ambiguous figure, a cheerful cynic who befriends Henry and is put out by the romance with Catherine. "Why don't you be like me?" Rinaldi asks his "war brother". "All fire and smoke. Nothing inside." Rinaldi's role here is a change from the original story, a gamble by Borzage and writers Benjamin Glazer and Oliver H. P. Garrett that pays off, devising some needed tension to the central storyline and underscoring the core message of the rottenness of war. If it wasn't for war, Rinaldi might value something more than his next bottle or bedpartner, and Menjou, in a final triumphant moment, lets you know it. Pacifism, in movies as in life, only takes one so far. The film makes a mistake near the end by more consciously making a stand as an anti-war film, with much hysteria, bells ringing, even Cooper chanting "Peace...peace". It made those points much better as sidenotes, like an opening tracking shot where a seemingly sleeping soldier is revealed to be dead, or later on when Cooper trudges through a muddy path and notices the corpse everyone's been walking on. By contrast, too much of the movie's finale is played for the cheaper seats, and doesn't stand up today. But the film does stand up better than many later Hemingway adaptations, with its strong cast, inspired tracking shots, and a mostly successful effort by Borzage to translate Hemingway's terse prose style into film. What you get is a short but deep examination of life during wartime.

    Gary Cooper stars as Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American ambulance driver serving in the Italian army during World War I. There he meets and falls in love with a nurse named Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) but the war looms heavy over the couple's chances for happiness. While this movie feels a bit dated and the war scenes go on too long and seem to be too darkly lit, this is epic romance that ultimately proves hard to take one's eyes off. You root for the characters and want to overcome the odds despite all that stands in their way making the final reality of what ultimately happens all the more potent. A real tear-jerker for the soft hearted this one. Great romance! Let's love tonight for we may not have tomorrow...the harsh reality of war.

    DVD rental. Though I'd only previously seen one or two Borzage films, and those long ago, I decided that he was going to be my next big discovery. Oh woe is me to find out that only this of his dozens of films is widely available on DVD, and the VHS are not easy to find unless you want to buy them all off of eBay. Anyway, I don't have a lot to say about this one, thanks largely to the very very poor sound mix on the DVD (most of the dialog between the two principals is very low, the rest rather loud, so I had to keep raising & lowering the volume which really distracted me). Also, it really wasn't that involving despite good to stellar work the cast: Gary Cooper as American Lt Henry, an ambulance driver in Italy during WWI, who falls instantly and madly in love with nurse Catharine Barkley (Helen Hayes) despite the insistent warnings from cynical friend Major Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou, the very definition of the cynic). The early parts carry a fairly light tone despite the background of the war; when the lovers are parted Cooper makes a perilous trek to Switzerland, through hell itself it seems in the film's finest apocalyptic war-to-end-wars moments, courtesy of Charles Lang's cinematography, the real star of the show. It's beautiful, well-acted, but it just didn't move me the way it was trying to. I've never really "gotten" the appeal of Hemingway, from whose novel this is adapted, so perhaps that's part of the problem.

    A Farewell to Arms, originally a novel by Ernest Hemingway, is a classic movie from 1932. The story follows the love between Lieutenant Fredric Henry and Catherine Barkley in Italy during WWI. The story is told from the view point of the Lieutenant. The love between Fredric and Catherine all starts when Fredric comes to Milan to visit an Italian friend Rinaldi, when Fredric and Catherine spend a night together. She is deeply hurt by this, thinking that Fredric is just using her, but he calmly tells her that it meant something to him and that he would be back. He did come back, but it was with a big injury, which allows him and Catherine to really get close to each other. Rinaldi doesn't like it, as he liked Catherine first, and tries to get Fredric to come and drink with him constantly. Later, when Fredric is healthy again, he gets sent back to the front lines, and Catherine leaves for Switzerland without telling Fredric first. She writes to Fredric constantly, even telling him that she is pregnant and can't wait to see him. He writes to Milan, where he thinks she is, and somehow all of his letters get sent back. Catherine's letters get censored by Rinaldi, saying that he doesn't want his friend to lose his head over a girl, little knowing how serious they actually were. Eventually Fredric can't take it anymore and goes back to Milan to find his love, who isn't there. Rinaldi tries to make him forget about her and is roughly refused. Rinaldi then realizes his mistake and tells Fredric where she is and helps him get there, as Fredric is now a traitor for going AWOL during the middle of the war. Catherine stills expects letters to come to her from Fredric, and is greatly surprised to find that there are letters for her, but they are all her letters that have been sent back. She faints to the floor and is sent to the hospital. Fredric arrives soon after that, but can't see her until the morning. He is told that the war is over, but he doesn't even begin to care, as his love is dying in the hospital. He gets to see her in the morning only to be there when she dies, and the story ends. One of the glaring things about this story is the main character, Fredric. He is not in tune with the people or events around him, but that is almost always the case with Hemingway. He is always out for only himself and doesn't really care who he hurts as long as he can get what he wants. As a case, he is introduced to Catherine by Rinaldi because Rinaldi is in love with her and wants her. That night, Rinaldi is left out by Fredric moving in and taking advantage of Rinaldi going to get Catherine and him drinks. Rinaldi is hurt, but Fredric makes it seem like he is the one being intruded on. This is a constant theme through the movie, most evident when Fredric goes AWOL during the middle of a battle, leaving all of his comrades there to work it out for themselves. Another theme of this movie is the camera angles. I love the camera work and how there is only one shot that is not from eye-level or above, and it is solely for impact. The shot is the scene where Fredric comes in from getting injured. The camera is a Point of View shot, from Fredric's eyes, unmoving, staring straight up. It becomes a more powerful scene because of it; it makes us be more in tune with Fredric and his injury. I also liked the lighting of the movie. Most of the lighting is natural, or at least it is made to look that way. Most of the lighting on the people's faces was blurry, like actually looking through a lens. It is most apparent when doing close ups on Catherine, it makes her look more innocent and makes her stand out more because the close ups are what you remember seeing of her, and you pay more attention to her. There is also no shot like that of any other character, again making you pay more attention to her than everyone else. This film, I think, doesn't use the mise-en-scene to its fullest. All of the cuts, except one, are just straight cuts with no delay or fading in and out. The one scene that does use a different cut is at the end when Fredric is traveling after he goes AWOL. It fades in and out of shots of Fredric and shots of the war and nature, all blurry. This gives a great effect on the passage of time and the sorrow that is all around, especially on Fredric. I think that they could have done more with the passage of time in the cuts, not the time in the narrative, but the time in the cut itself. Slower cuts might have made it a little more powerful, especially in times where the viewer is sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for more information.

    Perhaps I should state at the outset that I have not read Ernest Hemingway's third novel, the 1929 classic "A Farewell to Arms," and thus can only comment on the 1932 filmization that I recently watched on DVD. Hemingway, as the story goes, actively disliked the picture, and with its relatively brief running time of 78 minutes, it's easy to imagine that a good part of the author's original was given the Hollywood glossover. (The 1957 remake, generally regarded as the inferior of the two, is yet almost twice as long!) A somewhat dated, slightly creaky affair, the film is of interest today mainly for the excellent performances turned in by its three leads and for the Oscar-winning photography of Charles Lang (his only Academy Award, despite a more-than-impressive filmography). In the picture, we meet an American ambulance driver named Frederic Henry (played by Gary Cooper), who is serving on the Italian front during WW1. A doctor friend of his, an Italian named Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), introduces him to a British nurse, Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes, riding high after her recent Oscar win for 1931's little-seen "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," and who largely forsook Hollywood after 1935, to become "The First Lady of the American Theater"). The two instantly fall in lust (American nurse Agnes von Kurowsky, Hemingway's inspiration for the Hayes character, who he'd met while injured in Italy, had rebuffed the author's amorous advances), and after Henry is wounded at the front, Catherine tends to his wounds in hospital, becoming, uh, knocked up in the process. Forced to leave her nursing group as a result, Catherine hides out in Switzerland to have her baby, alone, leading to the mother of all tear-jerking conclusions.... Released in December '32, shortly before the stifling Production Code came into being, "A Farewell to Arms" is, surprisingly, sexually frank. Catherine and Henry, scant minutes after being introduced in a hotel garden, are busily engaged in the ol' "horizontal tarantella," their randiness attributed to "the war" more than their own natural inclinations. Still, Henry tells his newfound galpal "I love you" immediately afterwards, and, as events subsequently demonstrate, he means it. Cooper and Hayes do have a certain chemistry here, although they make an odd-looking couple, with Cooper towering over his girl by a good head and a half. Much of the dialogue that they utter is of the florid, purple-prose variety, and Hayes seems to occasionally overact a tad. Also (and please don't think me a superficial pigdog here), lookswise, Hayes was far from the comeliest actress on the lot, although Rinaldi refers to Catherine as the prettiest nurse in the area. Given her plain-Jane decent looks, this instant lustful infatuation on Henry's part becomes a bit incredible; a sweeter-faced actress of the period, say Claudette Colbert, might have been a better casting choice. Cooper, with his shy smile and diffident delivery, is always ingratiating, however, and Adolphe manages to convince as an Italian doctor. (Like many folks, I have a feeling, I've long thought that Menjou was French, whereas he was actually born in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.!) Director Frank Borzage, who would go on to work with Cooper in the 1936 Marlene Dietrich vehicle "Desire," does a thoroughly admirable job here, while Charles Lang certainly did earn his Oscar, especially by dint of two powerful scenes: the POV shots from Henry's moving hospital gurney, and the montage sequence of Henry's trek to find Catherine in Brissago, Switzerland. In all, a perfectly respectable film, and one that I might have appreciated a little more, had I not seen the WW1 classics "Grand Illusion" (1937) and "All Quiet on the Western Front" (1930)--two infinitely superior pictures--at NYC's Film Forum just a few weeks earlier. Still, those immortal classics are more antiwar films, whereas "A Farewell to Arms" is a romantic drama with a WW1 backdrop. The film concludes most ambiguously, with Henry proclaiming "Peace, peace" as doves fly high and the Great War ends. But whether he is praying for world peace, or peace and surcease from his tragic memories, or peace for the pitiful woman in his arms, is anybody's guess....

    In many ways Frank Borzage was the Douglas Sirk of the late twenties/early thirties churning out the same kind of fodder albeit without the gloss that Sirk was able to achieve via colour. Here Borzage weighs in with the very first adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway book - both Hems novels and short stories were eventually adapted for the screen) and on the whole he makes a decent fist of it. The novel itself was barely in the bookstores when the film was made which meant that literate filmgoers would have room to criticize the films' several departures whilst non-readers would accept it on its own terms. Leading lady Helen Hayes was primarily a stage actress - indeed so eminent was she that a Broadway Theatre was named after her - who made a late impact on the screen in Airport some thirty years after 'Farewell'. Watching the film for the first time some 80 years after its initial release I was unable to detect much real chemistry between Coop and Hayes albeit it was good to see Coop doing vulnerable, not a quality readily associated with him but if anyone walks away with the movie it is Adolph Menjou as Rinaldi, Frederic Henry's surgeon friend who, for various reasons, contrives to keep the lovers apart and even break them up. Certainly worth seeing without being memorable.

    A Farewell to Arms (1932) An unabashed over the top war romance (by Hemingway) and two young actors at the peak of their abilities. Add some really vigorous filming (some of the actions scenes in the battle are frightening and awesome), and you can see why this is such a powerful movie. There is a little sense of familiarity to this kind of story, and an old fashioned romantic flavor to it (the book is similar in outline but slightly cooler, more prosaic, more intense, more true). I think Helen Hayes is perfect but only from the director's point of view--she gave him what he wanted for this kind of high drama, and I love the performance. Gary Cooper never sits right for me--his facial twitches remain twitches, his woodenness you can knock on with your knuckles--but this is one of his best performances, alongside "High Noon." The photography by Charles Lang is really one of the highlights, and in weird way there are so many wordless part of the film, it has the strength of a great silent film with sound effects. Which pushes the burden further on the visuals. Another of the great early 1930s testaments to pure filming. Does it work in the end? Partly. But it's really sentimental, and you have to like uncomplicated emotional conflict, and resolution, complete resolution.

    Some interesting facts in a story loosely based on Hemingway's experiences, but he didn't like it. 1) Semi-autobiographical novel by Ernest Hemingway, published 1929, still in print. 2) The title is from a 16th century poem by George Peele. 3) Hemingway was an American ambulance driver for Italian army during WWI. 4) Hemingway, known for being ornery cuss had little use for people in the film industry. But he did like Cooper and they became close friends for the rest of their lives. 5) The studio shot two different endings so theater owners could pick which their audience would like best. Hemingway hated that but liked the $24k for the rights. 6) Helen Hayes, although happily married at the time had a crush on Cooper admitting in her autobiography 'like half the women in the world, I was, in the words of the Noel Coward song, "Mad about the boy."' 7) Helen Hayes, First Lady of the American Theater, was born in year 1900 in Washington D.C. a) On stage at age 5; Broadway at 9 and by age 18, she was a star. b) In 1928 she married playwright Charles MacArthur, they moved to Hollywood and she won her first Oscar for THE SIN OF MADELON CLAUDET (1931). c) She won a Tony Award the first year they were presented, in 1947, for HAPPY BIRTHDAY. d) She won Televisions Emmy award in 1952 & 1958. e) She returned to films as the Dowager Empress in ANASTASIA (1956) and won another Oscar for her role in AIRPORT (1970). f) Her son is actor James MacArthur (of HAWAII FIVE-O fame). 9) Gary Cooper born on the Montana ranch of his wealthy father, and educated in a prestigious school in England  Cooper was a rugged frontiersman with the poise of a cultured gentleman. a) Because he failed at political cartooning he sought work as a cowboy extra in movies. b) While making THE WINNING OF BARBARA WORTH movie star Clara Bow also took an interest in Cooper seeing that he was in more of her films. c) Silent films taught him how to act. d) Cooper's first talkie success was THE VIRGINIAN (1929), in which he developed the taciturn, laconic speech patterns that became fodder for every impressionist on radio, nightclubs, and television. e) Cooper alternated between tie-and-tails parts in DESIGN FOR LIVING (1933) and he-man adventurer roles in THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER (1935) for most of the 1930s. f) In 1941, he was honored with an Oscar for SERGEANT YORK, and was nominated for, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES. g) Even those co-workers who thought that Cooper wasn't exerting himself at all when filming were amazed to see how, in the final product, Cooper was actually out-acting everyone else, albeit in a subtle, unobtrusive manner. h) Some of my favorite Cooper films: MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, MEET JOHN DOE, BALL OF FIRE, FOUNTAINHEAD. i) In the 1950s he made mostly westerns like HIGH NOON, Cooper retained his box-office stature. Privately, however, he was plagued by illnesses finally dying of lung cancer in 1961. 10) Adolph Menjou, who plays Cooper's drinking buddy and an Army surgeon actually served as a captain in the Ambulance Corps for 3 years during WWI. a) Made more than 100 films moving from silent film leading man to talkies and later supporting roles. b) Menjou was Oscar nominated for THE FRONT PAGE the year before tonight's film in 1931. He played the newspaper editor later played by Cary Grant in the remake HIS GIRL Friday. c) In the 1950's Menjou was a "friendly witness" before the HUAC commission. d) His last notable film was the classic anti-war picture PATHS OF GLORY (1957) playing the villainous WWI General for director Stanley Kubrick. 11) Director Frank Borzage was one of the early major directors of Hollywood and like his contemporaries JOHN FORD, HOWARD HAWKS & KING VIDOR they all made the transition from silents to talkies but only Borzage won an Oscar as a director in both eras. His Academy Award for Best Director was for his earlier romantic WWI film, SEVENTH HEAVEN. Remade with Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones, A Farewell to Arms (1957) and as a TV miniseries with George Hamilton and Vanessa Redgrave, "A Farewell to Arms" (1966). In reality, she (the nurse) dumped Hemingway as he was 5 years younger (too young in her eyes) and she went back to the older Italian man!!! Hemingway was so hurt that when he wrote the novel he killed her off.

    Im a massive fan of these type of films! I found it here: http://www.videoarchive.talktalk.net I wasn't able to find this on DVD but was able to watch it online in excellent quality, well worth it. Old black and white ones are a favourite with my dad who is just fed up with the current rubbish that they have on TV these days - most of which are repeats. So this is easy to navigate and is a firm favourite - quite an achievement for someone of his age who is a complete technophobe. I bought him a laptop and told him it was a TV - I am hoping he doesn't find out its a computer he has been using all this time There are some others on the site too. http://www.videoarchive.talktalk.net

    This film has, at the beginning several instances of behavior that many films utilize that make me wonder if the behavior was intended by the author, director, or actor. A natural plot point was exhibited when the ambulances were going uphill & someone in back pleaded for the truck to stop because a wounded soldier was 'bleeding to death'. The ambulance could not stop because it was on a grade and stopping was impossible. This would show the cruelty of war. However, when the ambulance reaches the hospital the lieutenant in charge of the ambulance flirts with nurses before arranging for off-loading patients at the hospital. Gary Cooper, as Lieutenant Henry, does his cute-character bit while wounded soldiers are dying in the ambulances. Did the author intend for the lieutenant to behave with such cruelty? The lieutenant will later desert out of love for his wife. Maybe his whole manner is of a self-involved dandy. But the author has characters mentioning the cruelty of war all the time. But if these people are cruel also, how can they complain. The character doctor Rinaldi says something along the lines that Christians should not mind being killed, presumably because they go on to their 'reward' of heaven. Did the author write this? Did the author intend the flippant way that the doctor says it? The director shoots a shot of an uncaring lieutenant immediately after the ambulance attendant complains that a soldier is bleeding to death. Was this the intention of the author, the director (or editor) making a statement of their own. Maybe this was a decision by Gary Cooper. The nurse and lieutenant may complain about the cruelty of war, but their whole affair was the result of them volunteering to be there. Then they proceed to abandon there posts repeatedly. To me any case to be made for the importance of humanity is undermined by everybody in the 'play' lacking it. The doctor friend of Henry keeps calling Henry his baby & then proceeds to destroy his life by pushing him to alcoholism. Each character seems to say 'I'm human and it is important to be human' & then proceeds to do something cruel. Presumably, the war only ended because of exhaustion and not because of intelligent human thought. I guess what confuses me is the way the characters (or actors) work very hard, which tends to make me sympathetic to them, but when their behavior is cruel a dissonance is created.

    Frank Borzage's 1932 version of "A Farewell To Arms" has the distinction of being the first film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel. It's more Hollywood than Hemingway: Long blankets of dialogue are condensed, sharp edges softened, and the romance between Lt. Henry and Catherine made into something more befitting Douglas Sirk than the unsentimental Papa. Yet a surprising amount of the novel's spirit does survive the transition. In a story not much different than what you might have read in high school, Lt. Henry (Gary Cooper) is an American ambulance corpsman serving with the Italian Army as it fights the Austrians along the Piave, a bloody backwater campaign of World War I. Henry meets nurse Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) and they quickly fall in love. But the violence of war, and the interference of friends like Capt. Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), threaten to tear them apart. The differences between book and movie are more in the matter of treatment than storyline. When Catherine and Lt. Henry first meet, they talk about her former lover, a war casualty. In the film, she says "If I had to do it all over again, I'd marry him". In the book, though, Catherine wasn't regretting sending him off to war unmarried, but without their having had sex. Yet a minute later, her lines come directly from the book, Catherine noting her daydreams about her old lover turning up at her hospital with a saber cut, then adding: "He didn't have a saber cut, they blew him to bits." For Hollywood, violence was always easier material than sex. Since this is a film made before the inhibiting Hays Code (Will, not Helen), Borzage and his writers are able to get away with a bit more than they would have just a couple of years later. Catherine and Henry still make love, and she gets pregnant. There IS a lot of Hemingway here. Catherine is a still somewhat mixed-up woman who hates the rain "because I see myself dead in it". The folly of war is openly expressed. "If nobody would attack, the war would be over," one soldier muses. Lt. Henry is wounded, and embarrassed because it happened while he was eating cheese. Even some small exchanges survive, like one between Lt. Henry and a nasty nurse. She: "Pity is wasted on you." He: "Thank you." But the film also strikes out for its own territory, successfully in the case of building up the role of Capt. Rinaldi. Menjou, who had been a real ambulance corps captain in World War I, creates a marvelously ambiguous figure, a cheerful cynic who befriends Henry and is put out by the romance with Catherine. "Why don't you be like me?" Rinaldi asks his "war brother". "All fire and smoke. Nothing inside." Rinaldi's role here is a change from the original story, a gamble by Borzage and writers Benjamin Glazer and Oliver H. P. Garrett that pays off, devising some needed tension to the central storyline and underscoring the core message of the rottenness of war. If it wasn't for war, Rinaldi might value something more than his next bottle or bedpartner, and Menjou, in a final triumphant moment, lets you know it. Pacifism, in movies as in life, only takes one so far. The film makes a mistake near the end by more consciously making a stand as an anti-war film, with much hysteria, bells ringing, even Cooper chanting "Peace...peace". It made those points much better as sidenotes, like an opening tracking shot where a seemingly sleeping soldier is revealed to be dead, or later on when Cooper trudges through a muddy path and notices the corpse everyone's been walking on. By contrast, too much of the movie's finale is played for the cheaper seats, and doesn't stand up today. But the film does stand up better than many later Hemingway adaptations, with its strong cast, inspired tracking shots, and a mostly successful effort by Borzage to translate Hemingway's terse prose style into film. What you get is a short but deep examination of life during wartime.

    Gary Cooper stars as Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American ambulance driver serving in the Italian army during World War I. There he meets and falls in love with a nurse named Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) but the war looms heavy over the couple's chances for happiness. While this movie feels a bit dated and the war scenes go on too long and seem to be too darkly lit, this is epic romance that ultimately proves hard to take one's eyes off. You root for the characters and want to overcome the odds despite all that stands in their way making the final reality of what ultimately happens all the more potent. A real tear-jerker for the soft hearted this one. Great romance! Let's love tonight for we may not have tomorrow...the harsh reality of war.

    DVD rental. Though I'd only previously seen one or two Borzage films, and those long ago, I decided that he was going to be my next big discovery. Oh woe is me to find out that only this of his dozens of films is widely available on DVD, and the VHS are not easy to find unless you want to buy them all off of eBay. Anyway, I don't have a lot to say about this one, thanks largely to the very very poor sound mix on the DVD (most of the dialog between the two principals is very low, the rest rather loud, so I had to keep raising & lowering the volume which really distracted me). Also, it really wasn't that involving despite good to stellar work the cast: Gary Cooper as American Lt Henry, an ambulance driver in Italy during WWI, who falls instantly and madly in love with nurse Catharine Barkley (Helen Hayes) despite the insistent warnings from cynical friend Major Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou, the very definition of the cynic). The early parts carry a fairly light tone despite the background of the war; when the lovers are parted Cooper makes a perilous trek to Switzerland, through hell itself it seems in the film's finest apocalyptic war-to-end-wars moments, courtesy of Charles Lang's cinematography, the real star of the show. It's beautiful, well-acted, but it just didn't move me the way it was trying to. I've never really "gotten" the appeal of Hemingway, from whose novel this is adapted, so perhaps that's part of the problem.

    A Farewell to Arms, originally a novel by Ernest Hemingway, is a classic movie from 1932. The story follows the love between Lieutenant Fredric Henry and Catherine Barkley in Italy during WWI. The story is told from the view point of the Lieutenant. The love between Fredric and Catherine all starts when Fredric comes to Milan to visit an Italian friend Rinaldi, when Fredric and Catherine spend a night together. She is deeply hurt by this, thinking that Fredric is just using her, but he calmly tells her that it meant something to him and that he would be back. He did come back, but it was with a big injury, which allows him and Catherine to really get close to each other. Rinaldi doesn't like it, as he liked Catherine first, and tries to get Fredric to come and drink with him constantly. Later, when Fredric is healthy again, he gets sent back to the front lines, and Catherine leaves for Switzerland without telling Fredric first. She writes to Fredric constantly, even telling him that she is pregnant and can't wait to see him. He writes to Milan, where he thinks she is, and somehow all of his letters get sent back. Catherine's letters get censored by Rinaldi, saying that he doesn't want his friend to lose his head over a girl, little knowing how serious they actually were. Eventually Fredric can't take it anymore and goes back to Milan to find his love, who isn't there. Rinaldi tries to make him forget about her and is roughly refused. Rinaldi then realizes his mistake and tells Fredric where she is and helps him get there, as Fredric is now a traitor for going AWOL during the middle of the war. Catherine stills expects letters to come to her from Fredric, and is greatly surprised to find that there are letters for her, but they are all her letters that have been sent back. She faints to the floor and is sent to the hospital. Fredric arrives soon after that, but can't see her until the morning. He is told that the war is over, but he doesn't even begin to care, as his love is dying in the hospital. He gets to see her in the morning only to be there when she dies, and the story ends. One of the glaring things about this story is the main character, Fredric. He is not in tune with the people or events around him, but that is almost always the case with Hemingway. He is always out for only himself and doesn't really care who he hurts as long as he can get what he wants. As a case, he is introduced to Catherine by Rinaldi because Rinaldi is in love with her and wants her. That night, Rinaldi is left out by Fredric moving in and taking advantage of Rinaldi going to get Catherine and him drinks. Rinaldi is hurt, but Fredric makes it seem like he is the one being intruded on. This is a constant theme through the movie, most evident when Fredric goes AWOL during the middle of a battle, leaving all of his comrades there to work it out for themselves. Another theme of this movie is the camera angles. I love the camera work and how there is only one shot that is not from eye-level or above, and it is solely for impact. The shot is the scene where Fredric comes in from getting injured. The camera is a Point of View shot, from Fredric's eyes, unmoving, staring straight up. It becomes a more powerful scene because of it; it makes us be more in tune with Fredric and his injury. I also liked the lighting of the movie. Most of the lighting is natural, or at least it is made to look that way. Most of the lighting on the people's faces was blurry, like actually looking through a lens. It is most apparent when doing close ups on Catherine, it makes her look more innocent and makes her stand out more because the close ups are what you remember seeing of her, and you pay more attention to her. There is also no shot like that of any other character, again making you pay more attention to her than everyone else. This film, I think, doesn't use the mise-en-scene to its fullest. All of the cuts, except one, are just straight cuts with no delay or fading in and out. The one scene that does use a different cut is at the end when Fredric is traveling after he goes AWOL. It fades in and out of shots of Fredric and shots of the war and nature, all blurry. This gives a great effect on the passage of time and the sorrow that is all around, especially on Fredric. I think that they could have done more with the passage of time in the cuts, not the time in the narrative, but the time in the cut itself. Slower cuts might have made it a little more powerful, especially in times where the viewer is sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for more information.

    Perhaps I should state at the outset that I have not read Ernest Hemingway's third novel, the 1929 classic "A Farewell to Arms," and thus can only comment on the 1932 filmization that I recently watched on DVD. Hemingway, as the story goes, actively disliked the picture, and with its relatively brief running time of 78 minutes, it's easy to imagine that a good part of the author's original was given the Hollywood glossover. (The 1957 remake, generally regarded as the inferior of the two, is yet almost twice as long!) A somewhat dated, slightly creaky affair, the film is of interest today mainly for the excellent performances turned in by its three leads and for the Oscar-winning photography of Charles Lang (his only Academy Award, despite a more-than-impressive filmography). In the picture, we meet an American ambulance driver named Frederic Henry (played by Gary Cooper), who is serving on the Italian front during WW1. A doctor friend of his, an Italian named Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), introduces him to a British nurse, Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes, riding high after her recent Oscar win for 1931's little-seen "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," and who largely forsook Hollywood after 1935, to become "The First Lady of the American Theater"). The two instantly fall in lust (American nurse Agnes von Kurowsky, Hemingway's inspiration for the Hayes character, who he'd met while injured in Italy, had rebuffed the author's amorous advances), and after Henry is wounded at the front, Catherine tends to his wounds in hospital, becoming, uh, knocked up in the process. Forced to leave her nursing group as a result, Catherine hides out in Switzerland to have her baby, alone, leading to the mother of all tear-jerking conclusions.... Released in December '32, shortly before the stifling Production Code came into being, "A Farewell to Arms" is, surprisingly, sexually frank. Catherine and Henry, scant minutes after being introduced in a hotel garden, are busily engaged in the ol' "horizontal tarantella," their randiness attributed to "the war" more than their own natural inclinations. Still, Henry tells his newfound galpal "I love you" immediately afterwards, and, as events subsequently demonstrate, he means it. Cooper and Hayes do have a certain chemistry here, although they make an odd-looking couple, with Cooper towering over his girl by a good head and a half. Much of the dialogue that they utter is of the florid, purple-prose variety, and Hayes seems to occasionally overact a tad. Also (and please don't think me a superficial pigdog here), lookswise, Hayes was far from the comeliest actress on the lot, although Rinaldi refers to Catherine as the prettiest nurse in the area. Given her plain-Jane decent looks, this instant lustful infatuation on Henry's part becomes a bit incredible; a sweeter-faced actress of the period, say Claudette Colbert, might have been a better casting choice. Cooper, with his shy smile and diffident delivery, is always ingratiating, however, and Adolphe manages to convince as an Italian doctor. (Like many folks, I have a feeling, I've long thought that Menjou was French, whereas he was actually born in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.!) Director Frank Borzage, who would go on to work with Cooper in the 1936 Marlene Dietrich vehicle "Desire," does a thoroughly admirable job here, while Charles Lang certainly did earn his Oscar, especially by dint of two powerful scenes: the POV shots from Henry's moving hospital gurney, and the montage sequence of Henry's trek to find Catherine in Brissago, Switzerland. In all, a perfectly respectable film, and one that I might have appreciated a little more, had I not seen the WW1 classics "Grand Illusion" (1937) and "All Quiet on the Western Front" (1930)--two infinitely superior pictures--at NYC's Film Forum just a few weeks earlier. Still, those immortal classics are more antiwar films, whereas "A Farewell to Arms" is a romantic drama with a WW1 backdrop. The film concludes most ambiguously, with Henry proclaiming "Peace, peace" as doves fly high and the Great War ends. But whether he is praying for world peace, or peace and surcease from his tragic memories, or peace for the pitiful woman in his arms, is anybody's guess....

    A Farewell to Arms (1932) An unabashed over the top war romance (by Hemingway) and two young actors at the peak of their abilities. Add some really vigorous filming (some of the actions scenes in the battle are frightening and awesome), and you can see why this is such a powerful movie. There is a little sense of familiarity to this kind of story, and an old fashioned romantic flavor to it (the book is similar in outline but slightly cooler, more prosaic, more intense, more true). I think Helen Hayes is perfect but only from the director's point of view--she gave him what he wanted for this kind of high drama, and I love the performance. Gary Cooper never sits right for me--his facial twitches remain twitches, his woodenness you can knock on with your knuckles--but this is one of his best performances, alongside "High Noon." The photography by Charles Lang is really one of the highlights, and in weird way there are so many wordless part of the film, it has the strength of a great silent film with sound effects. Which pushes the burden further on the visuals. Another of the great early 1930s testaments to pure filming. Does it work in the end? Partly. But it's really sentimental, and you have to like uncomplicated emotional conflict, and resolution, complete resolution.

    Some interesting facts in a story loosely based on Hemingway's experiences, but he didn't like it. 1) Semi-autobiographical novel by Ernest Hemingway, published 1929, still in print. 2) The title is from a 16th century poem by George Peele. 3) Hemingway was an American ambulance driver for Italian army during WWI. 4) Hemingway, known for being ornery cuss had little use for people in the film industry. But he did like Cooper and they became close friends for the rest of their lives. 5) The studio shot two different endings so theater owners could pick which their audience would like best. Hemingway hated that but liked the $24k for the rights. 6) Helen Hayes, although happily married at the time had a crush on Cooper admitting in her autobiography 'like half the women in the world, I was, in the words of the Noel Coward song, "Mad about the boy."' 7) Helen Hayes, First Lady of the American Theater, was born in year 1900 in Washington D.C. a) On stage at age 5; Broadway at 9 and by age 18, she was a star. b) In 1928 she married playwright Charles MacArthur, they moved to Hollywood and she won her first Oscar for THE SIN OF MADELON CLAUDET (1931). c) She won a Tony Award the first year they were presented, in 1947, for HAPPY BIRTHDAY. d) She won Televisions Emmy award in 1952 & 1958. e) She returned to films as the Dowager Empress in ANASTASIA (1956) and won another Oscar for her role in AIRPORT (1970). f) Her son is actor James MacArthur (of HAWAII FIVE-O fame). 9) Gary Cooper born on the Montana ranch of his wealthy father, and educated in a prestigious school in England  Cooper was a rugged frontiersman with the poise of a cultured gentleman. a) Because he failed at political cartooning he sought work as a cowboy extra in movies. b) While making THE WINNING OF BARBARA WORTH movie star Clara Bow also took an interest in Cooper seeing that he was in more of her films. c) Silent films taught him how to act. d) Cooper's first talkie success was THE VIRGINIAN (1929), in which he developed the taciturn, laconic speech patterns that became fodder for every impressionist on radio, nightclubs, and television. e) Cooper alternated between tie-and-tails parts in DESIGN FOR LIVING (1933) and he-man adventurer roles in THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER (1935) for most of the 1930s. f) In 1941, he was honored with an Oscar for SERGEANT YORK, and was nominated for, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES. g) Even those co-workers who thought that Cooper wasn't exerting himself at all when filming were amazed to see how, in the final product, Cooper was actually out-acting everyone else, albeit in a subtle, unobtrusive manner. h) Some of my favorite Cooper films: MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, MEET JOHN DOE, BALL OF FIRE, FOUNTAINHEAD. i) In the 1950s he made mostly westerns like HIGH NOON, Cooper retained his box-office stature. Privately, however, he was plagued by illnesses finally dying of lung cancer in 1961. 10) Adolph Menjou, who plays Cooper's drinking buddy and an Army surgeon actually served as a captain in the Ambulance Corps for 3 years during WWI. a) Made more than 100 films moving from silent film leading man to talkies and later supporting roles. b) Menjou was Oscar nominated for THE FRONT PAGE the year before tonight's film in 1931. He played the newspaper editor later played by Cary Grant in the remake HIS GIRL Friday. c) In the 1950's Menjou was a "friendly witness" before the HUAC commission. d) His last notable film was the classic anti-war picture PATHS OF GLORY (1957) playing the villainous WWI General for director Stanley Kubrick. 11) Director Frank Borzage was one of the early major directors of Hollywood and like his contemporaries JOHN FORD, HOWARD HAWKS & KING VIDOR they all made the transition from silents to talkies but only Borzage won an Oscar as a director in both eras. His Academy Award for Best Director was for his earlier romantic WWI film, SEVENTH HEAVEN. Remade with Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones, A Farewell to Arms (1957) and as a TV miniseries with George Hamilton and Vanessa Redgrave, "A Farewell to Arms" (1966). In reality, she (the nurse) dumped Hemingway as he was 5 years younger (too young in her eyes) and she went back to the older Italian man!!! Hemingway was so hurt that when he wrote the novel he killed her off.

    Im a massive fan of these type of films! I found it here: http://www.videoarchive.talktalk.net I wasn't able to find this on DVD but was able to watch it online in excellent quality, well worth it. Old black and white ones are a favourite with my dad who is just fed up with the current rubbish that they have on TV these days - most of which are repeats. So this is easy to navigate and is a firm favourite - quite an achievement for someone of his age who is a complete technophobe. I bought him a laptop and told him it was a TV - I am hoping he doesn't find out its a computer he has been using all this time There are some others on the site too. http://www.videoarchive.talktalk.net

    This film has, at the beginning several instances of behavior that many films utilize that make me wonder if the behavior was intended by the author, director, or actor. A natural plot point was exhibited when the ambulances were going uphill & someone in back pleaded for the truck to stop because a wounded soldier was 'bleeding to death'. The ambulance could not stop because it was on a grade and stopping was impossible. This would show the cruelty of war. However, when the ambulance reaches the hospital the lieutenant in charge of the ambulance flirts with nurses before arranging for off-loading patients at the hospital. Gary Cooper, as Lieutenant Henry, does his cute-character bit while wounded soldiers are dying in the ambulances. Did the author intend for the lieutenant to behave with such cruelty? The lieutenant will later desert out of love for his wife. Maybe his whole manner is of a self-involved dandy. But the author has characters mentioning the cruelty of war all the time. But if these people are cruel also, how can they complain. The character doctor Rinaldi says something along the lines that Christians should not mind being killed, presumably because they go on to their 'reward' of heaven. Did the author write this? Did the author intend the flippant way that the doctor says it? The director shoots a shot of an uncaring lieutenant immediately after the ambulance attendant complains that a soldier is bleeding to death. Was this the intention of the author, the director (or editor) making a statement of their own. Maybe this was a decision by Gary Cooper. The nurse and lieutenant may complain about the cruelty of war, but their whole affair was the result of them volunteering to be there. Then they proceed to abandon there posts repeatedly. To me any case to be made for the importance of humanity is undermined by everybody in the 'play' lacking it. The doctor friend of Henry keeps calling Henry his baby & then proceeds to destroy his life by pushing him to alcoholism. Each character seems to say 'I'm human and it is important to be human' & then proceeds to do something cruel. Presumably, the war only ended because of exhaustion and not because of intelligent human thought. I guess what confuses me is the way the characters (or actors) work very hard, which tends to make me sympathetic to them, but when their behavior is cruel a dissonance is created.

    Frank Borzage's 1932 version of "A Farewell To Arms" has the distinction of being the first film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel. It's more Hollywood than Hemingway: Long blankets of dialogue are condensed, sharp edges softened, and the romance between Lt. Henry and Catherine made into something more befitting Douglas Sirk than the unsentimental Papa. Yet a surprising amount of the novel's spirit does survive the transition. In a story not much different than what you might have read in high school, Lt. Henry (Gary Cooper) is an American ambulance corpsman serving with the Italian Army as it fights the Austrians along the Piave, a bloody backwater campaign of World War I. Henry meets nurse Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) and they quickly fall in love. But the violence of war, and the interference of friends like Capt. Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), threaten to tear them apart. The differences between book and movie are more in the matter of treatment than storyline. When Catherine and Lt. Henry first meet, they talk about her former lover, a war casualty. In the film, she says "If I had to do it all over again, I'd marry him". In the book, though, Catherine wasn't regretting sending him off to war unmarried, but without their having had sex. Yet a minute later, her lines come directly from the book, Catherine noting her daydreams about her old lover turning up at her hospital with a saber cut, then adding: "He didn't have a saber cut, they blew him to bits." For Hollywood, violence was always easier material than sex. Since this is a film made before the inhibiting Hays Code (Will, not Helen), Borzage and his writers are able to get away with a bit more than they would have just a couple of years later. Catherine and Henry still make love, and she gets pregnant. There IS a lot of Hemingway here. Catherine is a still somewhat mixed-up woman who hates the rain "because I see myself dead in it". The folly of war is openly expressed. "If nobody would attack, the war would be over," one soldier muses. Lt. Henry is wounded, and embarrassed because it happened while he was eating cheese. Even some small exchanges survive, like one between Lt. Henry and a nasty nurse. She: "Pity is wasted on you." He: "Thank you." But the film also strikes out for its own territory, successfully in the case of building up the role of Capt. Rinaldi. Menjou, who had been a real ambulance corps captain in World War I, creates a marvelously ambiguous figure, a cheerful cynic who befriends Henry and is put out by the romance with Catherine. "Why don't you be like me?" Rinaldi asks his "war brother". "All fire and smoke. Nothing inside." Rinaldi's role here is a change from the original story, a gamble by Borzage and writers Benjamin Glazer and Oliver H. P. Garrett that pays off, devising some needed tension to the central storyline and underscoring the core message of the rottenness of war. If it wasn't for war, Rinaldi might value something more than his next bottle or bedpartner, and Menjou, in a final triumphant moment, lets you know it. Pacifism, in movies as in life, only takes one so far. The film makes a mistake near the end by more consciously making a stand as an anti-war film, with much hysteria, bells ringing, even Cooper chanting "Peace...peace". It made those points much better as sidenotes, like an opening tracking shot where a seemingly sleeping soldier is revealed to be dead, or later on when Cooper trudges through a muddy path and notices the corpse everyone's been walking on. By contrast, too much of the movie's finale is played for the cheaper seats, and doesn't stand up today. But the film does stand up better than many later Hemingway adaptations, with its strong cast, inspired tracking shots, and a mostly successful effort by Borzage to translate Hemingway's terse prose style into film. What you get is a short but deep examination of life during wartime.

    Gary Cooper stars as Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American ambulance driver serving in the Italian army during World War I. There he meets and falls in love with a nurse named Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) but the war looms heavy over the couple's chances for happiness. While this movie feels a bit dated and the war scenes go on too long and seem to be too darkly lit, this is epic romance that ultimately proves hard to take one's eyes off. You root for the characters and want to overcome the odds despite all that stands in their way making the final reality of what ultimately happens all the more potent. A real tear-jerker for the soft hearted this one. Great romance! Let's love tonight for we may not have tomorrow...the harsh reality of war.

    DVD rental. Though I'd only previously seen one or two Borzage films, and those long ago, I decided that he was going to be my next big discovery. Oh woe is me to find out that only this of his dozens of films is widely available on DVD, and the VHS are not easy to find unless you want to buy them all off of eBay. Anyway, I don't have a lot to say about this one, thanks largely to the very very poor sound mix on the DVD (most of the dialog between the two principals is very low, the rest rather loud, so I had to keep raising & lowering the volume which really distracted me). Also, it really wasn't that involving despite good to stellar work the cast: Gary Cooper as American Lt Henry, an ambulance driver in Italy during WWI, who falls instantly and madly in love with nurse Catharine Barkley (Helen Hayes) despite the insistent warnings from cynical friend Major Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou, the very definition of the cynic). The early parts carry a fairly light tone despite the background of the war; when the lovers are parted Cooper makes a perilous trek to Switzerland, through hell itself it seems in the film's finest apocalyptic war-to-end-wars moments, courtesy of Charles Lang's cinematography, the real star of the show. It's beautiful, well-acted, but it just didn't move me the way it was trying to. I've never really "gotten" the appeal of Hemingway, from whose novel this is adapted, so perhaps that's part of the problem.

    A Farewell to Arms, originally a novel by Ernest Hemingway, is a classic movie from 1932. The story follows the love between Lieutenant Fredric Henry and Catherine Barkley in Italy during WWI. The story is told from the view point of the Lieutenant. The love between Fredric and Catherine all starts when Fredric comes to Milan to visit an Italian friend Rinaldi, when Fredric and Catherine spend a night together. She is deeply hurt by this, thinking that Fredric is just using her, but he calmly tells her that it meant something to him and that he would be back. He did come back, but it was with a big injury, which allows him and Catherine to really get close to each other. Rinaldi doesn't like it, as he liked Catherine first, and tries to get Fredric to come and drink with him constantly. Later, when Fredric is healthy again, he gets sent back to the front lines, and Catherine leaves for Switzerland without telling Fredric first. She writes to Fredric constantly, even telling him that she is pregnant and can't wait to see him. He writes to Milan, where he thinks she is, and somehow all of his letters get sent back. Catherine's letters get censored by Rinaldi, saying that he doesn't want his friend to lose his head over a girl, little knowing how serious they actually were. Eventually Fredric can't take it anymore and goes back to Milan to find his love, who isn't there. Rinaldi tries to make him forget about her and is roughly refused. Rinaldi then realizes his mistake and tells Fredric where she is and helps him get there, as Fredric is now a traitor for going AWOL during the middle of the war. Catherine stills expects letters to come to her from Fredric, and is greatly surprised to find that there are letters for her, but they are all her letters that have been sent back. She faints to the floor and is sent to the hospital. Fredric arrives soon after that, but can't see her until the morning. He is told that the war is over, but he doesn't even begin to care, as his love is dying in the hospital. He gets to see her in the morning only to be there when she dies, and the story ends. One of the glaring things about this story is the main character, Fredric. He is not in tune with the people or events around him, but that is almost always the case with Hemingway. He is always out for only himself and doesn't really care who he hurts as long as he can get what he wants. As a case, he is introduced to Catherine by Rinaldi because Rinaldi is in love with her and wants her. That night, Rinaldi is left out by Fredric moving in and taking advantage of Rinaldi going to get Catherine and him drinks. Rinaldi is hurt, but Fredric makes it seem like he is the one being intruded on. This is a constant theme through the movie, most evident when Fredric goes AWOL during the middle of a battle, leaving all of his comrades there to work it out for themselves. Another theme of this movie is the camera angles. I love the camera work and how there is only one shot that is not from eye-level or above, and it is solely for impact. The shot is the scene where Fredric comes in from getting injured. The camera is a Point of View shot, from Fredric's eyes, unmoving, staring straight up. It becomes a more powerful scene because of it; it makes us be more in tune with Fredric and his injury. I also liked the lighting of the movie. Most of the lighting is natural, or at least it is made to look that way. Most of the lighting on the people's faces was blurry, like actually looking through a lens. It is most apparent when doing close ups on Catherine, it makes her look more innocent and makes her stand out more because the close ups are what you remember seeing of her, and you pay more attention to her. There is also no shot like that of any other character, again making you pay more attention to her than everyone else. This film, I think, doesn't use the mise-en-scene to its fullest. All of the cuts, except one, are just straight cuts with no delay or fading in and out. The one scene that does use a different cut is at the end when Fredric is traveling after he goes AWOL. It fades in and out of shots of Fredric and shots of the war and nature, all blurry. This gives a great effect on the passage of time and the sorrow that is all around, especially on Fredric. I think that they could have done more with the passage of time in the cuts, not the time in the narrative, but the time in the cut itself. Slower cuts might have made it a little more powerful, especially in times where the viewer is sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for more information.

    Perhaps I should state at the outset that I have not read Ernest Hemingway's third novel, the 1929 classic "A Farewell to Arms," and thus can only comment on the 1932 filmization that I recently watched on DVD. Hemingway, as the story goes, actively disliked the picture, and with its relatively brief running time of 78 minutes, it's easy to imagine that a good part of the author's original was given the Hollywood glossover. (The 1957 remake, generally regarded as the inferior of the two, is yet almost twice as long!) A somewhat dated, slightly creaky affair, the film is of interest today mainly for the excellent performances turned in by its three leads and for the Oscar-winning photography of Charles Lang (his only Academy Award, despite a more-than-impressive filmography). In the picture, we meet an American ambulance driver named Frederic Henry (played by Gary Cooper), who is serving on the Italian front during WW1. A doctor friend of his, an Italian named Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), introduces him to a British nurse, Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes, riding high after her recent Oscar win for 1931's little-seen "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," and who largely forsook Hollywood after 1935, to become "The First Lady of the American Theater"). The two instantly fall in lust (American nurse Agnes von Kurowsky, Hemingway's inspiration for the Hayes character, who he'd met while injured in Italy, had rebuffed the author's amorous advances), and after Henry is wounded at the front, Catherine tends to his wounds in hospital, becoming, uh, knocked up in the process. Forced to leave her nursing group as a result, Catherine hides out in Switzerland to have her baby, alone, leading to the mother of all tear-jerking conclusions.... Released in December '32, shortly before the stifling Production Code came into being, "A Farewell to Arms" is, surprisingly, sexually frank. Catherine and Henry, scant minutes after being introduced in a hotel garden, are busily engaged in the ol' "horizontal tarantella," their randiness attributed to "the war" more than their own natural inclinations. Still, Henry tells his newfound galpal "I love you" immediately afterwards, and, as events subsequently demonstrate, he means it. Cooper and Hayes do have a certain chemistry here, although they make an odd-looking couple, with Cooper towering over his girl by a good head and a half. Much of the dialogue that they utter is of the florid, purple-prose variety, and Hayes seems to occasionally overact a tad. Also (and please don't think me a superficial pigdog here), lookswise, Hayes was far from the comeliest actress on the lot, although Rinaldi refers to Catherine as the prettiest nurse in the area. Given her plain-Jane decent looks, this instant lustful infatuation on Henry's part becomes a bit incredible; a sweeter-faced actress of the period, say Claudette Colbert, might have been a better casting choice. Cooper, with his shy smile and diffident delivery, is always ingratiating, however, and Adolphe manages to convince as an Italian doctor. (Like many folks, I have a feeling, I've long thought that Menjou was French, whereas he was actually born in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.!) Director Frank Borzage, who would go on to work with Cooper in the 1936 Marlene Dietrich vehicle "Desire," does a thoroughly admirable job here, while Charles Lang certainly did earn his Oscar, especially by dint of two powerful scenes: the POV shots from Henry's moving hospital gurney, and the montage sequence of Henry's trek to find Catherine in Brissago, Switzerland. In all, a perfectly respectable film, and one that I might have appreciated a little more, had I not seen the WW1 classics "Grand Illusion" (1937) and "All Quiet on the Western Front" (1930)--two infinitely superior pictures--at NYC's Film Forum just a few weeks earlier. Still, those immortal classics are more antiwar films, whereas "A Farewell to Arms" is a romantic drama with a WW1 backdrop. The film concludes most ambiguously, with Henry proclaiming "Peace, peace" as doves fly high and the Great War ends. But whether he is praying for world peace, or peace and surcease from his tragic memories, or peace for the pitiful woman in his arms, is anybody's guess....

    In many ways Frank Borzage was the Douglas Sirk of the late twenties/early thirties churning out the same kind of fodder albeit without the gloss that Sirk was able to achieve via colour. Here Borzage weighs in with the very first adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway book - both Hems novels and short stories were eventually adapted for the screen) and on the whole he makes a decent fist of it. The novel itself was barely in the bookstores when the film was made which meant that literate filmgoers would have room to criticize the films' several departures whilst non-readers would accept it on its own terms. Leading lady Helen Hayes was primarily a stage actress - indeed so eminent was she that a Broadway Theatre was named after her - who made a late impact on the screen in Airport some thirty years after 'Farewell'. Watching the film for the first time some 80 years after its initial release I was unable to detect much real chemistry between Coop and Hayes albeit it was good to see Coop doing vulnerable, not a quality readily associated with him but if anyone walks away with the movie it is Adolph Menjou as Rinaldi, Frederic Henry's surgeon friend who, for various reasons, contrives to keep the lovers apart and even break them up. Certainly worth seeing without being memorable.

    A Farewell to Arms (1932) An unabashed over the top war romance (by Hemingway) and two young actors at the peak of their abilities. Add some really vigorous filming (some of the actions scenes in the battle are frightening and awesome), and you can see why this is such a powerful movie. There is a little sense of familiarity to this kind of story, and an old fashioned romantic flavor to it (the book is similar in outline but slightly cooler, more prosaic, more intense, more true). I think Helen Hayes is perfect but only from the director's point of view--she gave him what he wanted for this kind of high drama, and I love the performance. Gary Cooper never sits right for me--his facial twitches remain twitches, his woodenness you can knock on with your knuckles--but this is one of his best performances, alongside "High Noon." The photography by Charles Lang is really one of the highlights, and in weird way there are so many wordless part of the film, it has the strength of a great silent film with sound effects. Which pushes the burden further on the visuals. Another of the great early 1930s testaments to pure filming. Does it work in the end? Partly. But it's really sentimental, and you have to like uncomplicated emotional conflict, and resolution, complete resolution.

Privately, however, he was plagued by illnesses finally dying of lung cancer in 1961. 10) Adolph Menjou, who plays Cooper's drinking buddy and an Army surgeon actually served as a captain in the Ambulance Corps for 3 years during WWI. a) Made more than 100 films moving from silent film leading man to talkies and later supporting roles. b) Menjou was Oscar nominated for THE FRONT PAGE the year before tonight's film in 1931. He played the newspaper editor later played by Cary Grant in the remake HIS GIRL Friday. c) In the 1950's Menjou was a "friendly witness" before the HUAC commission. d) His last notable film was the classic anti-war picture PATHS OF GLORY (1957) playing the villainous WWI General for director Stanley Kubrick. 11) Director Frank Borzage was one of the early major directors of Hollywood and like his contemporaries JOHN FORD, HOWARD HAWKS & KING VIDOR they all made the transition from silents to talkies but only Borzage won an Oscar as a director in both eras. His Academy Award for Best Director was for his earlier romantic WWI film, SEVENTH HEAVEN. Remade with Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones, A Farewell to Arms (1957) and as a TV miniseries with George Hamilton and Vanessa Redgrave, "A Farewell to Arms" (1966). In reality, she (the nurse) dumped Hemingway as he was 5 years younger (too young in her eyes) and she went back to the older Italian man!!! Hemingway was so hurt that when he wrote the novel he killed her off.

    Im a massive fan of these type of films! I found it here: http://www.videoarchive.talktalk.net I wasn't able to find this on DVD but was able to watch it online in excellent quality, well worth it. Old black and white ones are a favourite with my dad who is just fed up with the current rubbish that they have on TV these days - most of which are repeats. So this is easy to navigate and is a firm favourite - quite an achievement for someone of his age who is a complete technophobe. I bought him a laptop and told him it was a TV - I am hoping he doesn't find out its a computer he has been using all this time There are some others on the site too. http://www.videoarchive.talktalk.net

    This film has, at the beginning several instances of behavior that many films utilize that make me wonder if the behavior was intended by the author, director, or actor. A natural plot point was exhibited when the ambulances were going uphill & someone in back pleaded for the truck to stop because a wounded soldier was 'bleeding to death'. The ambulance could not stop because it was on a grade and stopping was impossible. This would show the cruelty of war. However, when the ambulance reaches the hospital the lieutenant in charge of the ambulance flirts with nurses before arranging for off-loading patients at the hospital. Gary Cooper, as Lieutenant Henry, does his cute-character bit while wounded soldiers are dying in the ambulances. Did the author intend for the lieutenant to behave with such cruelty? The lieutenant will later desert out of love for his wife. Maybe his whole manner is of a self-involved dandy. But the author has characters mentioning the cruelty of war all the time. But if these people are cruel also, how can they complain. The character doctor Rinaldi says something along the lines that Christians should not mind being killed, presumably because they go on to their 'reward' of heaven. Did the author write this? Did the author intend the flippant way that the doctor says it? The director shoots a shot of an uncaring lieutenant immediately after the ambulance attendant complains that a soldier is bleeding to death. Was this the intention of the author, the director (or editor) making a statement of their own. Maybe this was a decision by Gary Cooper. The nurse and lieutenant may complain about the cruelty of war, but their whole affair was the result of them volunteering to be there. Then they proceed to abandon there posts repeatedly. To me any case to be made for the importance of humanity is undermined by everybody in the 'play' lacking it. The doctor friend of Henry keeps calling Henry his baby & then proceeds to destroy his life by pushing him to alcoholism. Each character seems to say 'I'm human and it is important to be human' & then proceeds to do something cruel. Presumably, the war only ended because of exhaustion and not because of intelligent human thought. I guess what confuses me is the way the characters (or actors) work very hard, which tends to make me sympathetic to them, but when their behavior is cruel a dissonance is created.

    Frank Borzage's 1932 version of "A Farewell To Arms" has the distinction of being the first film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel. It's more Hollywood than Hemingway: Long blankets of dialogue are condensed, sharp edges softened, and the romance between Lt. Henry and Catherine made into something more befitting Douglas Sirk than the unsentimental Papa. Yet a surprising amount of the novel's spirit does survive the transition. In a story not much different than what you might have read in high school, Lt. Henry (Gary Cooper) is an American ambulance corpsman serving with the Italian Army as it fights the Austrians along the Piave, a bloody backwater campaign of World War I. Henry meets nurse Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) and they quickly fall in love. But the violence of war, and the interference of friends like Capt. Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), threaten to tear them apart. The differences between book and movie are more in the matter of treatment than storyline. When Catherine and Lt. Henry first meet, they talk about her former lover, a war casualty. In the film, she says "If I had to do it all over again, I'd marry him". In the book, though, Catherine wasn't regretting sending him off to war unmarried, but without their having had sex. Yet a minute later, her lines come directly from the book, Catherine noting her daydreams about her old lover turning up at her hospital with a saber cut, then adding: "He didn't have a saber cut, they blew him to bits." For Hollywood, violence was always easier material than sex. Since this is a film made before the inhibiting Hays Code (Will, not Helen), Borzage and his writers are able to get away with a bit more than they would have just a couple of years later. Catherine and Henry still make love, and she gets pregnant. There IS a lot of Hemingway here. Catherine is a still somewhat mixed-up woman who hates the rain "because I see myself dead in it". The folly of war is openly expressed. "If nobody would attack, the war would be over," one soldier muses. Lt. Henry is wounded, and embarrassed because it happened while he was eating cheese. Even some small exchanges survive, like one between Lt. Henry and a nasty nurse. She: "Pity is wasted on you." He: "Thank you." But the film also strikes out for its own territory, successfully in the case of building up the role of Capt. Rinaldi. Menjou, who had been a real ambulance corps captain in World War I, creates a marvelously ambiguous figure, a cheerful cynic who befriends Henry and is put out by the romance with Catherine. "Why don't you be like me?" Rinaldi asks his "war brother". "All fire and smoke. Nothing inside." Rinaldi's role here is a change from the original story, a gamble by Borzage and writers Benjamin Glazer and Oliver H. P. Garrett that pays off, devising some needed tension to the central storyline and underscoring the core message of the rottenness of war. If it wasn't for war, Rinaldi might value something more than his next bottle or bedpartner, and Menjou, in a final triumphant moment, lets you know it. Pacifism, in movies as in life, only takes one so far. The film makes a mistake near the end by more consciously making a stand as an anti-war film, with much hysteria, bells ringing, even Cooper chanting "Peace...peace". It made those points much better as sidenotes, like an opening tracking shot where a seemingly sleeping soldier is revealed to be dead, or later on when Cooper trudges through a muddy path and notices the corpse everyone's been walking on. By contrast, too much of the movie's finale is played for the cheaper seats, and doesn't stand up today. But the film does stand up better than many later Hemingway adaptations, with its strong cast, inspired tracking shots, and a mostly successful effort by Borzage to translate Hemingway's terse prose style into film. What you get is a short but deep examination of life during wartime.

    Gary Cooper stars as Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American ambulance driver serving in the Italian army during World War I. There he meets and falls in love with a nurse named Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) but the war looms heavy over the couple's chances for happiness. While this movie feels a bit dated and the war scenes go on too long and seem to be too darkly lit, this is epic romance that ultimately proves hard to take one's eyes off. You root for the characters and want to overcome the odds despite all that stands in their way making the final reality of what ultimately happens all the more potent. A real tear-jerker for the soft hearted this one. Great romance! Let's love tonight for we may not have tomorrow...the harsh reality of war.

    DVD rental. Though I'd only previously seen one or two Borzage films, and those long ago, I decided that he was going to be my next big discovery. Oh woe is me to find out that only this of his dozens of films is widely available on DVD, and the VHS are not easy to find unless you want to buy them all off of eBay. Anyway, I don't have a lot to say about this one, thanks largely to the very very poor sound mix on the DVD (most of the dialog between the two principals is very low, the rest rather loud, so I had to keep raising & lowering the volume which really distracted me). Also, it really wasn't that involving despite good to stellar work the cast: Gary Cooper as American Lt Henry, an ambulance driver in Italy during WWI, who falls instantly and madly in love with nurse Catharine Barkley (Helen Hayes) despite the insistent warnings from cynical friend Major Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou, the very definition of the cynic). The early parts carry a fairly light tone despite the background of the war; when the lovers are parted Cooper makes a perilous trek to Switzerland, through hell itself it seems in the film's finest apocalyptic war-to-end-wars moments, courtesy of Charles Lang's cinematography, the real star of the show. It's beautiful, well-acted, but it just didn't move me the way it was trying to. I've never really "gotten" the appeal of Hemingway, from whose novel this is adapted, so perhaps that's part of the problem.

    A Farewell to Arms, originally a novel by Ernest Hemingway, is a classic movie from 1932. The story follows the love between Lieutenant Fredric Henry and Catherine Barkley in Italy during WWI. The story is told from the view point of the Lieutenant. The love between Fredric and Catherine all starts when Fredric comes to Milan to visit an Italian friend Rinaldi, when Fredric and Catherine spend a night together. She is deeply hurt by this, thinking that Fredric is just using her, but he calmly tells her that it meant something to him and that he would be back. He did come back, but it was with a big injury, which allows him and Catherine to really get close to each other. Rinaldi doesn't like it, as he liked Catherine first, and tries to get Fredric to come and drink with him constantly. Later, when Fredric is healthy again, he gets sent back to the front lines, and Catherine leaves for Switzerland without telling Fredric first. She writes to Fredric constantly, even telling him that she is pregnant and can't wait to see him. He writes to Milan, where he thinks she is, and somehow all of his letters get sent back. Catherine's letters get censored by Rinaldi, saying that he doesn't want his friend to lose his head over a girl, little knowing how serious they actually were. Eventually Fredric can't take it anymore and goes back to Milan to find his love, who isn't there. Rinaldi tries to make him forget about her and is roughly refused. Rinaldi then realizes his mistake and tells Fredric where she is and helps him get there, as Fredric is now a traitor for going AWOL during the middle of the war. Catherine stills expects letters to come to her from Fredric, and is greatly surprised to find that there are letters for her, but they are all her letters that have been sent back. She faints to the floor and is sent to the hospital. Fredric arrives soon after that, but can't see her until the morning. He is told that the war is over, but he doesn't even begin to care, as his love is dying in the hospital. He gets to see her in the morning only to be there when she dies, and the story ends. One of the glaring things about this story is the main character, Fredric. He is not in tune with the people or events around him, but that is almost always the case with Hemingway. He is always out for only himself and doesn't really care who he hurts as long as he can get what he wants. As a case, he is introduced to Catherine by Rinaldi because Rinaldi is in love with her and wants her. That night, Rinaldi is left out by Fredric moving in and taking advantage of Rinaldi going to get Catherine and him drinks. Rinaldi is hurt, but Fredric makes it seem like he is the one being intruded on. This is a constant theme through the movie, most evident when Fredric goes AWOL during the middle of a battle, leaving all of his comrades there to work it out for themselves. Another theme of this movie is the camera angles. I love the camera work and how there is only one shot that is not from eye-level or above, and it is solely for impact. The shot is the scene where Fredric comes in from getting injured. The camera is a Point of View shot, from Fredric's eyes, unmoving, staring straight up. It becomes a more powerful scene because of it; it makes us be more in tune with Fredric and his injury. I also liked the lighting of the movie. Most of the lighting is natural, or at least it is made to look that way. Most of the lighting on the people's faces was blurry, like actually looking through a lens. It is most apparent when doing close ups on Catherine, it makes her look more innocent and makes her stand out more because the close ups are what you remember seeing of her, and you pay more attention to her. There is also no shot like that of any other character, again making you pay more attention to her than everyone else. This film, I think, doesn't use the mise-en-scene to its fullest. All of the cuts, except one, are just straight cuts with no delay or fading in and out. The one scene that does use a different cut is at the end when Fredric is traveling after he goes AWOL. It fades in and out of shots of Fredric and shots of the war and nature, all blurry. This gives a great effect on the passage of time and the sorrow that is all around, especially on Fredric. I think that they could have done more with the passage of time in the cuts, not the time in the narrative, but the time in the cut itself. Slower cuts might have made it a little more powerful, especially in times where the viewer is sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for more information.
