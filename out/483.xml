 <storyline>
  In World War II Casablanca, Rick Blaine, exiled American and former freedom fighter, runs the most popular nightspot in town. The cynical lone wolf Blaine comes into the possession of two valuable letters of transit. When Nazi Major Strasser arrives in Casablanca, the sycophantic police Captain Renault does what he can to please him, including detaining a Czechoslovak underground leader Victor Laszlo. Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with Ilsa, Rick's one time love. Rick is very bitter towards Ilsa, who ran out on him in Paris, but when he learns she had good reason to, they plan to run off together again using the letters of transit. Well, that was their original plan....

    On the form, one can't deny that the actors are all rather accurate and most importantly that the cinematography is so refined it doesn't give the impression the movie was shot in 1942. Now the problem lies in the content. The first half of the film is pretty annoying, endeavouring to set the tone of a plot that struggles to really initiate its development. The pace accelerates in the second half, reviving the interest, but the dramatic progression remains quite difficult, and the movie overall doesn't turn out to be convincing enough despite well written dialogues. Moreover, it falls sometimes a bit too easily into melodramatiscim, with for instance a much too grandiloquent soundtrack that tires quickly. Anyway, for sure Casablanca was a pioneer in its time, but like a lot of other old classics, critics seem to favour too much this aspect compared to the intrinsic quality of the movie, which would explain why it is so highly regarded.

    Connor Macgregor Reviews...Casablanca I have just finished watching Casablanca which has now become in my eyes, a true cinematic classic. The wonderful acting,story and location work really gave the film something magical that puts it in the group of Gone With The Wind and The Godfather In the early years of World War II, the Moroccan city of Casablanca attracts people from all over. Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Though we learn later that Rick once harboured enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached: "I stick my neck out for nobody." What i love about this film is Humphrey Bogart. His ability to put himself firmly in a role and believe in it is extraordinary. I think Rick Blaine is one of the most cool and charming characters on the screen. Ilsa is also a true beauty on the screen. You can really feel for the love between Rick & Ilsa and how they will die for each other if it became possible. But in the end, their love can conquer all only not together and that is one of the most touching scenes in cinema when they have their final conversation. The ending stands out as one of the best in Cinema. That infamous final quote "Louis,I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship" summed up my love for this film and what it achieved now and then. Casablanca is a true cinematic classic and must be watched by all people. Rating - 100% - A+ - ***** Stars

    Romance is generally my least favored genre because all it has is a predictable storyline, over the top melodrama & nothing much happening throughout the runtime. Casablanca has a predictable storyline too but what sets it apart from other films is the quality of direction & writing and sensational performances from its lead actors. The opening introduction of the characters was carried out brilliantly and throughout the movie you get to hear some amazing quotes coming from the gem script. Add to that, the performances are very, very strong. Humphrey Bogart gives an effortless performance but it's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman who turned out to be the most impressive for me. Every aspect of this film feels like a stunning work of art. And last but not the least, even after 70 long years, Casablanca hasn't aged a day and like wine, is only getting better and continues to be the benchmark by which all the romantic films are measured.

    Humphrey Bogart is one of those actors that could say more with a look than a screenwriter could fit on three pages of a script. I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets. Writes of today could use a little education on imagination: one man with a .45, dry whit and a vocabulary void of any f-bombs can be very entertaining.

    This is the perfect movie. Everything, from the script to the actors and the setting, screams quality. The script is the tightest I've ever seen; not a word is wasted, and entire stretches of dialog are quotable more than 50 years later. I enjoy each actor that shows up on the screen, from Humphrey Bogart as the nightclub owner Rick to Peter Lorre doing his best as a local lowlife. The music, provided by Dooley Wilson, is memorable even today. For many films of that era, the songs lasted about as long as the next movie in the theater, so this is quite an accomplishment. Overall, this is the best movie I've ever seen.

    "Casablanca" is not a simple movie for plenty of reasons, is a movie which is stigmatizing you. When I saw this movie I felt that I was there too, with Humphrey Bogart at Rick's caf&eacute; and I heard this beautiful song in the piano with him. This is "Casablanca", it makes you want to be a part of it, to be with it. I always tell about the cast but for this film you do not have to say anything about this or for the screenplay and the direction, all people know that in this film all of these staff are perfect, the only thing that you have and need to tell is what were your emotions about this film when you saw it. I want to tell only one last thing about this great movie, when you see this movie just leave yourself free and enjoy it, you will really like it.

    From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song "As Time Goes By" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Caf&eacute;. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme "As Time Goes By" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.

    "This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship"  that is how this unforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes place in the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see the city (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life of the city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape from the horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nights full of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. The love story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories in the currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger and larger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, is show in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie is black-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also a color version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. If you have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. And if you have watched it... Play It Again Sam.

    I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times and I never get tired nor bored of it. All the actors are incredible and absolutely all the scenes are memorable.I just love all the different relationships between the main characters. I wish I could feel what I felt the first time I saw the movie (I was 15). My parents were so happy that I loved that movie that they started recommending me other great classic movies they loved as well (Lawrence of Arabia, Gilda, All About Eve, His Girl Friday...) Thanks God to the classics because I have lost faith with the actual cinema. P.S. My daughter's name is, of course, Ilsa! :))

    This film is great because it gives the viewer a look into a period in history through the eyes of an ordinary man, a hero, a soldier, a woman and someone in love. It is simple and yet impossible to grasp at times and can be watched over and over again. The actors play their roles amazingly and leave the viewer speechless at times. This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished. Casablanca is a great movie that allows the viewer to personally take a stake in the plot and watch as events leave them sad, horrified, heartbroken and elated at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.

The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.

    "This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship"  that is how this unforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes place in the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see the city (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life of the city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape from the horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nights full of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. The love story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories in the currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger and larger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, is show in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie is black-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also a color version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. If you have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. And if you have watched it... Play It Again Sam.

    I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times and I never get tired nor bored of it. All the actors are incredible and absolutely all the scenes are memorable.I just love all the different relationships between the main characters. I wish I could feel what I felt the first time I saw the movie (I was 15). My parents were so happy that I loved that movie that they started recommending me other great classic movies they loved as well (Lawrence of Arabia, Gilda, All About Eve, His Girl Friday...) Thanks God to the classics because I have lost faith with the actual cinema. P.S. My daughter's name is, of course, Ilsa! :))

    This film is great because it gives the viewer a look into a period in history through the eyes of an ordinary man, a hero, a soldier, a woman and someone in love. It is simple and yet impossible to grasp at times and can be watched over and over again. The actors play their roles amazingly and leave the viewer speechless at times. This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished. Casablanca is a great movie that allows the viewer to personally take a stake in the plot and watch as events leave them sad, horrified, heartbroken and elated at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.

    On the form, one can't deny that the actors are all rather accurate and most importantly that the cinematography is so refined it doesn't give the impression the movie was shot in 1942. Now the problem lies in the content. The first half of the film is pretty annoying, endeavouring to set the tone of a plot that struggles to really initiate its development. The pace accelerates in the second half, reviving the interest, but the dramatic progression remains quite difficult, and the movie overall doesn't turn out to be convincing enough despite well written dialogues. Moreover, it falls sometimes a bit too easily into melodramatiscim, with for instance a much too grandiloquent soundtrack that tires quickly. Anyway, for sure Casablanca was a pioneer in its time, but like a lot of other old classics, critics seem to favour too much this aspect compared to the intrinsic quality of the movie, which would explain why it is so highly regarded.

    Connor Macgregor Reviews...Casablanca I have just finished watching Casablanca which has now become in my eyes, a true cinematic classic. The wonderful acting,story and location work really gave the film something magical that puts it in the group of Gone With The Wind and The Godfather In the early years of World War II, the Moroccan city of Casablanca attracts people from all over. Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Though we learn later that Rick once harboured enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached: "I stick my neck out for nobody." What i love about this film is Humphrey Bogart. His ability to put himself firmly in a role and believe in it is extraordinary. I think Rick Blaine is one of the most cool and charming characters on the screen. Ilsa is also a true beauty on the screen. You can really feel for the love between Rick & Ilsa and how they will die for each other if it became possible. But in the end, their love can conquer all only not together and that is one of the most touching scenes in cinema when they have their final conversation. The ending stands out as one of the best in Cinema. That infamous final quote "Louis,I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship" summed up my love for this film and what it achieved now and then. Casablanca is a true cinematic classic and must be watched by all people. Rating - 100% - A+ - ***** Stars

    Romance is generally my least favored genre because all it has is a predictable storyline, over the top melodrama & nothing much happening throughout the runtime. Casablanca has a predictable storyline too but what sets it apart from other films is the quality of direction & writing and sensational performances from its lead actors. The opening introduction of the characters was carried out brilliantly and throughout the movie you get to hear some amazing quotes coming from the gem script. Add to that, the performances are very, very strong. Humphrey Bogart gives an effortless performance but it's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman who turned out to be the most impressive for me. Every aspect of this film feels like a stunning work of art. And last but not the least, even after 70 long years, Casablanca hasn't aged a day and like wine, is only getting better and continues to be the benchmark by which all the romantic films are measured.

    Humphrey Bogart is one of those actors that could say more with a look than a screenwriter could fit on three pages of a script. I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets. Writes of today could use a little education on imagination: one man with a .45, dry whit and a vocabulary void of any f-bombs can be very entertaining.

    This is the perfect movie. Everything, from the script to the actors and the setting, screams quality. The script is the tightest I've ever seen; not a word is wasted, and entire stretches of dialog are quotable more than 50 years later. I enjoy each actor that shows up on the screen, from Humphrey Bogart as the nightclub owner Rick to Peter Lorre doing his best as a local lowlife. The music, provided by Dooley Wilson, is memorable even today. For many films of that era, the songs lasted about as long as the next movie in the theater, so this is quite an accomplishment. Overall, this is the best movie I've ever seen.

    "Casablanca" is not a simple movie for plenty of reasons, is a movie which is stigmatizing you. When I saw this movie I felt that I was there too, with Humphrey Bogart at Rick's caf&eacute; and I heard this beautiful song in the piano with him. This is "Casablanca", it makes you want to be a part of it, to be with it. I always tell about the cast but for this film you do not have to say anything about this or for the screenplay and the direction, all people know that in this film all of these staff are perfect, the only thing that you have and need to tell is what were your emotions about this film when you saw it. I want to tell only one last thing about this great movie, when you see this movie just leave yourself free and enjoy it, you will really like it.

    From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song "As Time Goes By" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Caf&eacute;. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme "As Time Goes By" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.

There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song "As Time Goes By" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Caf&eacute;. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme "As Time Goes By" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.

    "This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship"  that is how this unforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes place in the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see the city (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life of the city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape from the horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nights full of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. The love story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories in the currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger and larger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, is show in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie is black-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also a color version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. If you have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. And if you have watched it... Play It Again Sam.

    I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times and I never get tired nor bored of it. All the actors are incredible and absolutely all the scenes are memorable.I just love all the different relationships between the main characters. I wish I could feel what I felt the first time I saw the movie (I was 15). My parents were so happy that I loved that movie that they started recommending me other great classic movies they loved as well (Lawrence of Arabia, Gilda, All About Eve, His Girl Friday...) Thanks God to the classics because I have lost faith with the actual cinema. P.S. My daughter's name is, of course, Ilsa! :))

    This film is great because it gives the viewer a look into a period in history through the eyes of an ordinary man, a hero, a soldier, a woman and someone in love. It is simple and yet impossible to grasp at times and can be watched over and over again. The actors play their roles amazingly and leave the viewer speechless at times. This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished. Casablanca is a great movie that allows the viewer to personally take a stake in the plot and watch as events leave them sad, horrified, heartbroken and elated at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.

    On the form, one can't deny that the actors are all rather accurate and most importantly that the cinematography is so refined it doesn't give the impression the movie was shot in 1942. Now the problem lies in the content. The first half of the film is pretty annoying, endeavouring to set the tone of a plot that struggles to really initiate its development. The pace accelerates in the second half, reviving the interest, but the dramatic progression remains quite difficult, and the movie overall doesn't turn out to be convincing enough despite well written dialogues. Moreover, it falls sometimes a bit too easily into melodramatiscim, with for instance a much too grandiloquent soundtrack that tires quickly. Anyway, for sure Casablanca was a pioneer in its time, but like a lot of other old classics, critics seem to favour too much this aspect compared to the intrinsic quality of the movie, which would explain why it is so highly regarded.

    Connor Macgregor Reviews...Casablanca I have just finished watching Casablanca which has now become in my eyes, a true cinematic classic. The wonderful acting,story and location work really gave the film something magical that puts it in the group of Gone With The Wind and The Godfather In the early years of World War II, the Moroccan city of Casablanca attracts people from all over. Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Though we learn later that Rick once harboured enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached: "I stick my neck out for nobody." What i love about this film is Humphrey Bogart. His ability to put himself firmly in a role and believe in it is extraordinary. I think Rick Blaine is one of the most cool and charming characters on the screen. Ilsa is also a true beauty on the screen. You can really feel for the love between Rick & Ilsa and how they will die for each other if it became possible. But in the end, their love can conquer all only not together and that is one of the most touching scenes in cinema when they have their final conversation. The ending stands out as one of the best in Cinema. That infamous final quote "Louis,I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship" summed up my love for this film and what it achieved now and then. Casablanca is a true cinematic classic and must be watched by all people. Rating - 100% - A+ - ***** Stars

    Romance is generally my least favored genre because all it has is a predictable storyline, over the top melodrama & nothing much happening throughout the runtime. Casablanca has a predictable storyline too but what sets it apart from other films is the quality of direction & writing and sensational performances from its lead actors. The opening introduction of the characters was carried out brilliantly and throughout the movie you get to hear some amazing quotes coming from the gem script. Add to that, the performances are very, very strong. Humphrey Bogart gives an effortless performance but it's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman who turned out to be the most impressive for me. Every aspect of this film feels like a stunning work of art. And last but not the least, even after 70 long years, Casablanca hasn't aged a day and like wine, is only getting better and continues to be the benchmark by which all the romantic films are measured.

    Humphrey Bogart is one of those actors that could say more with a look than a screenwriter could fit on three pages of a script. I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets. Writes of today could use a little education on imagination: one man with a .45, dry whit and a vocabulary void of any f-bombs can be very entertaining.

    This is the perfect movie. Everything, from the script to the actors and the setting, screams quality. The script is the tightest I've ever seen; not a word is wasted, and entire stretches of dialog are quotable more than 50 years later. I enjoy each actor that shows up on the screen, from Humphrey Bogart as the nightclub owner Rick to Peter Lorre doing his best as a local lowlife. The music, provided by Dooley Wilson, is memorable even today. For many films of that era, the songs lasted about as long as the next movie in the theater, so this is quite an accomplishment. Overall, this is the best movie I've ever seen.

    "Casablanca" is not a simple movie for plenty of reasons, is a movie which is stigmatizing you. When I saw this movie I felt that I was there too, with Humphrey Bogart at Rick's caf&eacute; and I heard this beautiful song in the piano with him. This is "Casablanca", it makes you want to be a part of it, to be with it. I always tell about the cast but for this film you do not have to say anything about this or for the screenplay and the direction, all people know that in this film all of these staff are perfect, the only thing that you have and need to tell is what were your emotions about this film when you saw it. I want to tell only one last thing about this great movie, when you see this movie just leave yourself free and enjoy it, you will really like it.

    From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song "As Time Goes By" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Caf&eacute;. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme "As Time Goes By" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners.

The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory.

It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song "As Time Goes By" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Caf&eacute;. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme "As Time Goes By" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.

    "This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship"  that is how this unforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes place in the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see the city (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life of the city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape from the horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nights full of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. The love story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories in the currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger and larger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, is show in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie is black-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also a color version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. If you have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. And if you have watched it... Play It Again Sam.

    I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times and I never get tired nor bored of it. All the actors are incredible and absolutely all the scenes are memorable.I just love all the different relationships between the main characters. I wish I could feel what I felt the first time I saw the movie (I was 15). My parents were so happy that I loved that movie that they started recommending me other great classic movies they loved as well (Lawrence of Arabia, Gilda, All About Eve, His Girl Friday...) Thanks God to the classics because I have lost faith with the actual cinema. P.S. My daughter's name is, of course, Ilsa! :))

    This film is great because it gives the viewer a look into a period in history through the eyes of an ordinary man, a hero, a soldier, a woman and someone in love. It is simple and yet impossible to grasp at times and can be watched over and over again. The actors play their roles amazingly and leave the viewer speechless at times. This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished. Casablanca is a great movie that allows the viewer to personally take a stake in the plot and watch as events leave them sad, horrified, heartbroken and elated at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.

    On the form, one can't deny that the actors are all rather accurate and most importantly that the cinematography is so refined it doesn't give the impression the movie was shot in 1942. Now the problem lies in the content. The first half of the film is pretty annoying, endeavouring to set the tone of a plot that struggles to really initiate its development. The pace accelerates in the second half, reviving the interest, but the dramatic progression remains quite difficult, and the movie overall doesn't turn out to be convincing enough despite well written dialogues. Moreover, it falls sometimes a bit too easily into melodramatiscim, with for instance a much too grandiloquent soundtrack that tires quickly. Anyway, for sure Casablanca was a pioneer in its time, but like a lot of other old classics, critics seem to favour too much this aspect compared to the intrinsic quality of the movie, which would explain why it is so highly regarded.

    Connor Macgregor Reviews...Casablanca I have just finished watching Casablanca which has now become in my eyes, a true cinematic classic. The wonderful acting,story and location work really gave the film something magical that puts it in the group of Gone With The Wind and The Godfather In the early years of World War II, the Moroccan city of Casablanca attracts people from all over. Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Though we learn later that Rick once harboured enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached: "I stick my neck out for nobody." What i love about this film is Humphrey Bogart. His ability to put himself firmly in a role and believe in it is extraordinary. I think Rick Blaine is one of the most cool and charming characters on the screen. Ilsa is also a true beauty on the screen. You can really feel for the love between Rick & Ilsa and how they will die for each other if it became possible. But in the end, their love can conquer all only not together and that is one of the most touching scenes in cinema when they have their final conversation. The ending stands out as one of the best in Cinema. That infamous final quote "Louis,I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship" summed up my love for this film and what it achieved now and then. Casablanca is a true cinematic classic and must be watched by all people. Rating - 100% - A+ - ***** Stars

    Romance is generally my least favored genre because all it has is a predictable storyline, over the top melodrama & nothing much happening throughout the runtime. Casablanca has a predictable storyline too but what sets it apart from other films is the quality of direction & writing and sensational performances from its lead actors. The opening introduction of the characters was carried out brilliantly and throughout the movie you get to hear some amazing quotes coming from the gem script. Add to that, the performances are very, very strong. Humphrey Bogart gives an effortless performance but it's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman who turned out to be the most impressive for me. Every aspect of this film feels like a stunning work of art. And last but not the least, even after 70 long years, Casablanca hasn't aged a day and like wine, is only getting better and continues to be the benchmark by which all the romantic films are measured.

    Humphrey Bogart is one of those actors that could say more with a look than a screenwriter could fit on three pages of a script. I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets. Writes of today could use a little education on imagination: one man with a .45, dry whit and a vocabulary void of any f-bombs can be very entertaining.

    This is the perfect movie. Everything, from the script to the actors and the setting, screams quality. The script is the tightest I've ever seen; not a word is wasted, and entire stretches of dialog are quotable more than 50 years later. I enjoy each actor that shows up on the screen, from Humphrey Bogart as the nightclub owner Rick to Peter Lorre doing his best as a local lowlife. The music, provided by Dooley Wilson, is memorable even today. For many films of that era, the songs lasted about as long as the next movie in the theater, so this is quite an accomplishment. Overall, this is the best movie I've ever seen.

    "Casablanca" is not a simple movie for plenty of reasons, is a movie which is stigmatizing you. When I saw this movie I felt that I was there too, with Humphrey Bogart at Rick's caf&eacute; and I heard this beautiful song in the piano with him. This is "Casablanca", it makes you want to be a part of it, to be with it. I always tell about the cast but for this film you do not have to say anything about this or for the screenplay and the direction, all people know that in this film all of these staff are perfect, the only thing that you have and need to tell is what were your emotions about this film when you saw it. I want to tell only one last thing about this great movie, when you see this movie just leave yourself free and enjoy it, you will really like it.

    "Casablanca" is not a simple movie for plenty of reasons, is a movie which is stigmatizing you. When I saw this movie I felt that I was there too, with Humphrey Bogart at Rick's caf&eacute; and I heard this beautiful song in the piano with him. This is "Casablanca", it makes you want to be a part of it, to be with it. I always tell about the cast but for this film you do not have to say anything about this or for the screenplay and the direction, all people know that in this film all of these staff are perfect, the only thing that you have and need to tell is what were your emotions about this film when you saw it. I want to tell only one last thing about this great movie, when you see this movie just leave yourself free and enjoy it, you will really like it.

    From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song "As Time Goes By" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Caf&eacute;. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme "As Time Goes By" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.

    "This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship"  that is how this unforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes place in the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see the city (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life of the city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape from the horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nights full of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. The love story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories in the currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger and larger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, is show in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie is black-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also a color version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. If you have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. And if you have watched it... Play It Again Sam.

    I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times and I never get tired nor bored of it. All the actors are incredible and absolutely all the scenes are memorable.I just love all the different relationships between the main characters. I wish I could feel what I felt the first time I saw the movie (I was 15). My parents were so happy that I loved that movie that they started recommending me other great classic movies they loved as well (Lawrence of Arabia, Gilda, All About Eve, His Girl Friday...) Thanks God to the classics because I have lost faith with the actual cinema. P.S. My daughter's name is, of course, Ilsa! :))

    This film is great because it gives the viewer a look into a period in history through the eyes of an ordinary man, a hero, a soldier, a woman and someone in love. It is simple and yet impossible to grasp at times and can be watched over and over again. The actors play their roles amazingly and leave the viewer speechless at times. This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished. Casablanca is a great movie that allows the viewer to personally take a stake in the plot and watch as events leave them sad, horrified, heartbroken and elated at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.

    On the form, one can't deny that the actors are all rather accurate and most importantly that the cinematography is so refined it doesn't give the impression the movie was shot in 1942. Now the problem lies in the content. The first half of the film is pretty annoying, endeavouring to set the tone of a plot that struggles to really initiate its development. The pace accelerates in the second half, reviving the interest, but the dramatic progression remains quite difficult, and the movie overall doesn't turn out to be convincing enough despite well written dialogues. Moreover, it falls sometimes a bit too easily into melodramatiscim, with for instance a much too grandiloquent soundtrack that tires quickly. Anyway, for sure Casablanca was a pioneer in its time, but like a lot of other old classics, critics seem to favour too much this aspect compared to the intrinsic quality of the movie, which would explain why it is so highly regarded.

    Connor Macgregor Reviews...Casablanca I have just finished watching Casablanca which has now become in my eyes, a true cinematic classic. The wonderful acting,story and location work really gave the film something magical that puts it in the group of Gone With The Wind and The Godfather In the early years of World War II, the Moroccan city of Casablanca attracts people from all over. Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Though we learn later that Rick once harboured enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached: "I stick my neck out for nobody." What i love about this film is Humphrey Bogart. His ability to put himself firmly in a role and believe in it is extraordinary. I think Rick Blaine is one of the most cool and charming characters on the screen. Ilsa is also a true beauty on the screen. You can really feel for the love between Rick & Ilsa and how they will die for each other if it became possible. But in the end, their love can conquer all only not together and that is one of the most touching scenes in cinema when they have their final conversation. The ending stands out as one of the best in Cinema. That infamous final quote "Louis,I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship" summed up my love for this film and what it achieved now and then. Casablanca is a true cinematic classic and must be watched by all people. Rating - 100% - A+ - ***** Stars

    Romance is generally my least favored genre because all it has is a predictable storyline, over the top melodrama & nothing much happening throughout the runtime. Casablanca has a predictable storyline too but what sets it apart from other films is the quality of direction & writing and sensational performances from its lead actors. The opening introduction of the characters was carried out brilliantly and throughout the movie you get to hear some amazing quotes coming from the gem script. Add to that, the performances are very, very strong. Humphrey Bogart gives an effortless performance but it's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman who turned out to be the most impressive for me. Every aspect of this film feels like a stunning work of art. And last but not the least, even after 70 long years, Casablanca hasn't aged a day and like wine, is only getting better and continues to be the benchmark by which all the romantic films are measured.

    Humphrey Bogart is one of those actors that could say more with a look than a screenwriter could fit on three pages of a script. I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets. Writes of today could use a little education on imagination: one man with a .45, dry whit and a vocabulary void of any f-bombs can be very entertaining.

    This is the perfect movie. Everything, from the script to the actors and the setting, screams quality. The script is the tightest I've ever seen; not a word is wasted, and entire stretches of dialog are quotable more than 50 years later. I enjoy each actor that shows up on the screen, from Humphrey Bogart as the nightclub owner Rick to Peter Lorre doing his best as a local lowlife. The music, provided by Dooley Wilson, is memorable even today. For many films of that era, the songs lasted about as long as the next movie in the theater, so this is quite an accomplishment. Overall, this is the best movie I've ever seen.

I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets. Writes of today could use a little education on imagination: one man with a .45, dry whit and a vocabulary void of any f-bombs can be very entertaining.

    This is the perfect movie. Everything, from the script to the actors and the setting, screams quality. The script is the tightest I've ever seen; not a word is wasted, and entire stretches of dialog are quotable more than 50 years later. I enjoy each actor that shows up on the screen, from Humphrey Bogart as the nightclub owner Rick to Peter Lorre doing his best as a local lowlife. The music, provided by Dooley Wilson, is memorable even today. For many films of that era, the songs lasted about as long as the next movie in the theater, so this is quite an accomplishment. Overall, this is the best movie I've ever seen.

    "Casablanca" is not a simple movie for plenty of reasons, is a movie which is stigmatizing you. When I saw this movie I felt that I was there too, with Humphrey Bogart at Rick's caf&eacute; and I heard this beautiful song in the piano with him. This is "Casablanca", it makes you want to be a part of it, to be with it. I always tell about the cast but for this film you do not have to say anything about this or for the screenplay and the direction, all people know that in this film all of these staff are perfect, the only thing that you have and need to tell is what were your emotions about this film when you saw it. I want to tell only one last thing about this great movie, when you see this movie just leave yourself free and enjoy it, you will really like it.

    From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song "As Time Goes By" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Caf&eacute;. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme "As Time Goes By" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.

    "This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship"  that is how this unforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes place in the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see the city (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life of the city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape from the horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nights full of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. The love story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories in the currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger and larger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, is show in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie is black-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also a color version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. If you have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. And if you have watched it... Play It Again Sam.

    I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times and I never get tired nor bored of it. All the actors are incredible and absolutely all the scenes are memorable.I just love all the different relationships between the main characters. I wish I could feel what I felt the first time I saw the movie (I was 15). My parents were so happy that I loved that movie that they started recommending me other great classic movies they loved as well (Lawrence of Arabia, Gilda, All About Eve, His Girl Friday...) Thanks God to the classics because I have lost faith with the actual cinema. P.S. My daughter's name is, of course, Ilsa! :))

    This film is great because it gives the viewer a look into a period in history through the eyes of an ordinary man, a hero, a soldier, a woman and someone in love. It is simple and yet impossible to grasp at times and can be watched over and over again. The actors play their roles amazingly and leave the viewer speechless at times. This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished. Casablanca is a great movie that allows the viewer to personally take a stake in the plot and watch as events leave them sad, horrified, heartbroken and elated at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.
