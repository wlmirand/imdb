 <sinopse>
  A widowed father has to deal with two complex issues: while he is searching for "Miss Right," his son, who is in his 20s and gay, is searching for "Mr. Right."
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Set in Sydney, Australia. A (heterosexual) father and his gay son are trying to find Ms/Mr Right respectively. The film shows their relationships with one another and the objects of their affection as tradgedy strikes. There is no overt 'message' in the film, just a very natural, entertaining story-telling.

    I really loved this movie, not just because of the actors, but because the movie really goes to the heart of who we are as people, and shows how we all are part of each other. It is a touching and funny story of love and acceptance. Russell Crowe does a good job as the son, but Jack Thompson really is the star of the movie, his character is the heart of the show. Through him we see the world differently, and we see a parent who loves his child and only wants what is best for them. Many of us could learn some real lessons from this. The backdrop of Sydney adds a little extra charm, in that we see a part of the world with which most of us are not familiar. I have recommended this movie to many friends, and each of them has truly enjoyed the movie, and related to it.

    As a polemic to conservative Australians, it hammers the message home. It might have worked as a piece of theater but as a film it fails. Preaching to the converted? I think so. No sexual chemistry between the leads...neither gay or straight. Russell's helmet-head, hawk-nosed, super hair-sprayed boyfriend doesn't convince. Everyone tries hard and fails. It has a low-brow streak of melancholy running throughout. A bit like a soap without the continuity. That this qualifies for inclusion in the top 100 gay films of all time on AfterElton can only reflect low expectations. Wanted to like it but didn't. Disappointing

    A comedy, one more, in this life that is so little comic indeed. We start with the promise of a revolution coming through and we end with a request or piece of advice that you better be home soon, and in between, love, romance, tragedy and a lot of empathy and misery with a little bit of happiness sprinkled on top, at times angry happiness because of the silly decision you took and it broke the potential happy development you were hoping for and looking forward to getting on a silver platter. You just got Saint John the Baptist's head. We are dealing here with grown up men and women all in strange situations. A young gay man living with his parents and the father behaves as if he did not know and he turns ugly when it becomes news stuff on TV. Another gay man living with his widower of a father who is not gay but accepts his son the way he is though he is invasive, maybe an intrusive voyeur, and in a way blocks his son's way to happiness. That same man gets in touch with a lady through some meeting club and the two fall for one another but the night when things were going to go through, New Year's Eve, at his place, the son being out for his own fun, she comes across some gay magazines and cannot accept the fact that she had not been told before, and if she had it would not have changed anything because she just does not want to go across this line. Just minutes after she drove off, when the fireworks start celebrating the New Year, he has a savage and wild heart attack or stroke and he will remain paralyzed on one side and without the capability to speak any more. In other words she broke his heart and that is not a metaphor, she literally did break his heart, boom. That is sad, very sad, but it is a comedy, so there must be a happy ending and life will take care of some haphazard meeting of the two young men and then life will be on tracks again. But gosh it is not easy to build your own happiness when you are not a photocopy of the standard middle of the way unoriginal model imposed by ethical and moral norms in our society, even when things have changed legally. Between the law and reality there is more than a simple Strait of Malacca: there are thousands of hostile pirates with weapons everywhere up over their heads ready to raid your life to prevent you from being happy. Enjoy the details. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    This is an amazing movie. It digs into deep personal feelings, no matter if you're gay or not. It shows a beautiful side of being human. This movie talks about love. It is clich&eacute;, but it is so true. It talks about friendship with love, how important it is for most of us to have the right partner and the supportive family to be just happy. If you are not a fan of Russell Crowe, watch this movie anyway. It may give you another sight of his early career I was myself ignorant about. And I don't need to say how brilliant Thompson is. I wish the tale would have a longer time line, and talk about what happens after.

    What's this, Russell Crowe playing it gay in a low budget Australian flick, could that be true? It doesn't sound like it from the surface, but digging a little deeper and that really is exactly what you have in The Sum of Us, a freakishly good low budget movie from 1994. The Sum of Us is basically the sum of a story of looking for love, first the widowed dad is looking for love and his 'Miss Right' whilst his twentyish son is also looking for love, but in the shape of his 'Mr Right'. This surprisingly endearing movie made on a budget less than most films spend on catering and cakes, is a witty and funny tale of love and laughter. The Sum of Us is not your typical gay movie in that nobody is dying, activism is not on the menu, nor is there a historical horror or an aggressive and overbearing father preventing the closet door from opening and not even the slightest hint of drag! Nope, this is a good and happy sort of soft tale, which has some nice funny bits and a couple of tender scenes to pique the heartstrings. The Sum of Us is taken directly from the stage play, as such, some of the lines are more 'stagey' than 'filmy' but get over those, and you have a very enjoyable film. Funny, interesting, charming, touching and rather refreshingly free from overt stereotypes, which can dog so many other gay films.

    This movie took me by surprise, it is personable, sincere and utterly Australian. It explores its themes in a beautiful manner, through the relationships between family, especially father and son. Don't be put off by Russel Crowe. I myself almost didn't watch it because he was in it, but I have to say, he did a brilliant job. He took the character and made it his own, and I feel no one else could have played the part any better. Take into account that this movie was originally a stage play, so there are various monologues and direct engagement with the audience. This at first is a little surprising and perhaps even uncomfortable, as we are so used to being purely observers when watching a movie. After initial surprise however I found the technique refreshing, it gave the film a more personable and intimate quality. I revel in how Australian this film is, the fact that I use the same brands of mustard and soy sauce which at one point appeared at the dinner table, made me unusually delighted and also pulled me into the realism which the film tries and succeeds in conveying. At risk of sounding patriotic, it almost made me proud to be Australian. This is probably one of my favourite movies, in its exploration of love and how it should not be dictated by the limits of our society.

    Sorry to burst everyone's bubble, but personally I found this film to be an almost total embarrassment in every way. The father bursts in (TWICE!) on his son while he's trying to get it on with a new guy he's met. Is that believable? Hardly. It's the kind of thing that a ten year old brother might do, not a parent, especially a parent who is gay-positive and hoping that his son will meet someone and have a serious affair. It's almost as embarrassing to watch the father meet a woman through a dating agency. The two of them act like they are 15 years old... and totally unnatural at that. When he decides to propose to her he actually gets down on one knee. If it were done tongue in cheek, maybe I could accept it, but it's done straight (pardon the pun). This film also has the bad habit of having the actors turn towards the camera and talk to the audience directly. Once or twice, maybe, but over and over again it totally breaks up the film and destroys any possibility of allowing the audience to get emotionally into what is happening. The worst moment in the film is when the father has had a stroke and is lying almost paralyzed in his bed. The son goes to get something, leaving the father alone, and all of a sudden he stops lying there like a vegetable, smiles, and starts chatting to the audience. It totally destroys any semblance of continuity and becomes annoying as hell by the end of the film. I suppose it's nice to have a film where some of the parents are understanding and (too) helpful to the gay son for a change, but does it have to be so adolescent in its presentation? There was only one thing in the entire film that was truly interesting, and that was what happened to the grandmother and her lover at the end of the film. Strangely enough, it doesn't even seem to fit in, but it makes the loudest statement for understanding than anything else in the film. In fact, I wish the film had been about the grandmother and her lover... that would have truly been ground-breaking and intriguing.

    Very good film on human relationships. The ways people take care of each other, especially relations between parents and children. Honesty, loyalty, comprehension and affection. The most important thing is love. You receive it as much as you give, sometimes more than you give. Compare relationships of parents and children : Jeff and his dad, and Greg and his father on the other side. It's not only making children and raising them by putting them to school, there are also comprehension and affection that must be given to them. Let them know one cares about them, not only reproaching, but also explaining. In a word, always talking and keeping things clear and said. That's the way to do. Unfortunately few people follow this way. Hope this film would make them change a little if they saw it. For some,lucky parents and lucky children.

    The Australian film "The Sum of Us," which was adapted by David Stevens from his own play, portrays the close relationship between a widowed father and his openly gay son. Although the play has been "opened up" in terms of breaking out of the stage production's single set, Stevens has retained several scenes in which the characters talk directly to the audience. A gimmick even on stage, these actors' asides to the viewer intrude on the story and, in one particular instance, completely destroy the reality of the situation. When an actor addresses the audience, he is saying in effect "this is only a movie and I am only an actor playing a part." However, despite this flaw, which is a serious one, the film offers two fine performances by Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson and an often-memorable story of love and the search for love. Although Harry Mitchell, played by Thompson, is an incredibly tolerant and understanding father, he is the proverbial "too much of a good thing." In his seemingly endless desire to see his son find the right mate, he is intrusive, overbearing, and completely oblivious to his own meddling. However, Thompson is such an amiable actor and imbues the character with so much charm that the viewer, like his son, has to forgive him anything. In an early role, young Russell Crowe already shows his range as an actor. Clad in short cutoffs throughout most of the film, Crowe also displays his physical charms as well for interested fans. While his looks are not classically handsome, his appeal is undeniable, and, to his credit, he does not play the character of Jeff with any hint of stereotypical gay mannerisms, and he is not averse to displaying affection towards another man. Although the movie follows Jeff's search for Mr. Right and Harry's search for Miss Right, the most touching and haunting scenes in the film and the play before it relate to the relationship that Harry's mother had with a woman named Mary. The two women lived and loved each other for 40 years before well meaning, but unintentionally cruel, relatives separated them "for their own good." The separation of his mother and her lover haunts Harry with the thoughts of what the two women discussed on their last night together, knowing that it was the last time that they would see each other. On stage, the story of the two women brought the audience to tears. Related visually on screen, the episode will haunt viewers as much as it did Harry. While certainly not a classic or even a groundbreaking film, "The Sum of Us" is competent, entertaining, warm, and full of hope that the world is moving in the right direction.

    It's been a while, like some ten years now, that I discovered The Sum of Us VHS and fell for Russell. I now have a DVD with subtitles. I haven't seen some of his early films but contrary to the American generalized opinion, I dislike Gladiator and that seems like a heresy to so many people. Well, I'm glad to be that heretic ! I also disliked Cinderella Man. But I love others, like The Insider, Master and Commander and many others. Comments like I've read in so many pages of adoration and repulse are to me like everyone has a right to his own opinion. As for mine, I would like to be close to Russell this lifetime and maybe some of the next.

In an early role, young Russell Crowe already shows his range as an actor. Clad in short cutoffs throughout most of the film, Crowe also displays his physical charms as well for interested fans. While his looks are not classically handsome, his appeal is undeniable, and, to his credit, he does not play the character of Jeff with any hint of stereotypical gay mannerisms, and he is not averse to displaying affection towards another man. Although the movie follows Jeff's search for Mr. Right and Harry's search for Miss Right, the most touching and haunting scenes in the film and the play before it relate to the relationship that Harry's mother had with a woman named Mary. The two women lived and loved each other for 40 years before well meaning, but unintentionally cruel, relatives separated them "for their own good." The separation of his mother and her lover haunts Harry with the thoughts of what the two women discussed on their last night together, knowing that it was the last time that they would see each other. On stage, the story of the two women brought the audience to tears. Related visually on screen, the episode will haunt viewers as much as it did Harry. While certainly not a classic or even a groundbreaking film, "The Sum of Us" is competent, entertaining, warm, and full of hope that the world is moving in the right direction.

    It's been a while, like some ten years now, that I discovered The Sum of Us VHS and fell for Russell. I now have a DVD with subtitles. I haven't seen some of his early films but contrary to the American generalized opinion, I dislike Gladiator and that seems like a heresy to so many people. Well, I'm glad to be that heretic ! I also disliked Cinderella Man. But I love others, like The Insider, Master and Commander and many others. Comments like I've read in so many pages of adoration and repulse are to me like everyone has a right to his own opinion. As for mine, I would like to be close to Russell this lifetime and maybe some of the next.

    I really loved this movie, not just because of the actors, but because the movie really goes to the heart of who we are as people, and shows how we all are part of each other. It is a touching and funny story of love and acceptance. Russell Crowe does a good job as the son, but Jack Thompson really is the star of the movie, his character is the heart of the show. Through him we see the world differently, and we see a parent who loves his child and only wants what is best for them. Many of us could learn some real lessons from this. The backdrop of Sydney adds a little extra charm, in that we see a part of the world with which most of us are not familiar. I have recommended this movie to many friends, and each of them has truly enjoyed the movie, and related to it.

    As a polemic to conservative Australians, it hammers the message home. It might have worked as a piece of theater but as a film it fails. Preaching to the converted? I think so. No sexual chemistry between the leads...neither gay or straight. Russell's helmet-head, hawk-nosed, super hair-sprayed boyfriend doesn't convince. Everyone tries hard and fails. It has a low-brow streak of melancholy running throughout. A bit like a soap without the continuity. That this qualifies for inclusion in the top 100 gay films of all time on AfterElton can only reflect low expectations. Wanted to like it but didn't. Disappointing

    A comedy, one more, in this life that is so little comic indeed. We start with the promise of a revolution coming through and we end with a request or piece of advice that you better be home soon, and in between, love, romance, tragedy and a lot of empathy and misery with a little bit of happiness sprinkled on top, at times angry happiness because of the silly decision you took and it broke the potential happy development you were hoping for and looking forward to getting on a silver platter. You just got Saint John the Baptist's head. We are dealing here with grown up men and women all in strange situations. A young gay man living with his parents and the father behaves as if he did not know and he turns ugly when it becomes news stuff on TV. Another gay man living with his widower of a father who is not gay but accepts his son the way he is though he is invasive, maybe an intrusive voyeur, and in a way blocks his son's way to happiness. That same man gets in touch with a lady through some meeting club and the two fall for one another but the night when things were going to go through, New Year's Eve, at his place, the son being out for his own fun, she comes across some gay magazines and cannot accept the fact that she had not been told before, and if she had it would not have changed anything because she just does not want to go across this line. Just minutes after she drove off, when the fireworks start celebrating the New Year, he has a savage and wild heart attack or stroke and he will remain paralyzed on one side and without the capability to speak any more. In other words she broke his heart and that is not a metaphor, she literally did break his heart, boom. That is sad, very sad, but it is a comedy, so there must be a happy ending and life will take care of some haphazard meeting of the two young men and then life will be on tracks again. But gosh it is not easy to build your own happiness when you are not a photocopy of the standard middle of the way unoriginal model imposed by ethical and moral norms in our society, even when things have changed legally. Between the law and reality there is more than a simple Strait of Malacca: there are thousands of hostile pirates with weapons everywhere up over their heads ready to raid your life to prevent you from being happy. Enjoy the details. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    This is an amazing movie. It digs into deep personal feelings, no matter if you're gay or not. It shows a beautiful side of being human. This movie talks about love. It is clich&eacute;, but it is so true. It talks about friendship with love, how important it is for most of us to have the right partner and the supportive family to be just happy. If you are not a fan of Russell Crowe, watch this movie anyway. It may give you another sight of his early career I was myself ignorant about. And I don't need to say how brilliant Thompson is. I wish the tale would have a longer time line, and talk about what happens after.

    What's this, Russell Crowe playing it gay in a low budget Australian flick, could that be true? It doesn't sound like it from the surface, but digging a little deeper and that really is exactly what you have in The Sum of Us, a freakishly good low budget movie from 1994. The Sum of Us is basically the sum of a story of looking for love, first the widowed dad is looking for love and his 'Miss Right' whilst his twentyish son is also looking for love, but in the shape of his 'Mr Right'. This surprisingly endearing movie made on a budget less than most films spend on catering and cakes, is a witty and funny tale of love and laughter. The Sum of Us is not your typical gay movie in that nobody is dying, activism is not on the menu, nor is there a historical horror or an aggressive and overbearing father preventing the closet door from opening and not even the slightest hint of drag! Nope, this is a good and happy sort of soft tale, which has some nice funny bits and a couple of tender scenes to pique the heartstrings. The Sum of Us is taken directly from the stage play, as such, some of the lines are more 'stagey' than 'filmy' but get over those, and you have a very enjoyable film. Funny, interesting, charming, touching and rather refreshingly free from overt stereotypes, which can dog so many other gay films.

    This movie took me by surprise, it is personable, sincere and utterly Australian. It explores its themes in a beautiful manner, through the relationships between family, especially father and son. Don't be put off by Russel Crowe. I myself almost didn't watch it because he was in it, but I have to say, he did a brilliant job. He took the character and made it his own, and I feel no one else could have played the part any better. Take into account that this movie was originally a stage play, so there are various monologues and direct engagement with the audience. This at first is a little surprising and perhaps even uncomfortable, as we are so used to being purely observers when watching a movie. After initial surprise however I found the technique refreshing, it gave the film a more personable and intimate quality. I revel in how Australian this film is, the fact that I use the same brands of mustard and soy sauce which at one point appeared at the dinner table, made me unusually delighted and also pulled me into the realism which the film tries and succeeds in conveying. At risk of sounding patriotic, it almost made me proud to be Australian. This is probably one of my favourite movies, in its exploration of love and how it should not be dictated by the limits of our society.

    Sorry to burst everyone's bubble, but personally I found this film to be an almost total embarrassment in every way. The father bursts in (TWICE!) on his son while he's trying to get it on with a new guy he's met. Is that believable? Hardly. It's the kind of thing that a ten year old brother might do, not a parent, especially a parent who is gay-positive and hoping that his son will meet someone and have a serious affair. It's almost as embarrassing to watch the father meet a woman through a dating agency. The two of them act like they are 15 years old... and totally unnatural at that. When he decides to propose to her he actually gets down on one knee. If it were done tongue in cheek, maybe I could accept it, but it's done straight (pardon the pun). This film also has the bad habit of having the actors turn towards the camera and talk to the audience directly. Once or twice, maybe, but over and over again it totally breaks up the film and destroys any possibility of allowing the audience to get emotionally into what is happening. The worst moment in the film is when the father has had a stroke and is lying almost paralyzed in his bed. The son goes to get something, leaving the father alone, and all of a sudden he stops lying there like a vegetable, smiles, and starts chatting to the audience. It totally destroys any semblance of continuity and becomes annoying as hell by the end of the film. I suppose it's nice to have a film where some of the parents are understanding and (too) helpful to the gay son for a change, but does it have to be so adolescent in its presentation? There was only one thing in the entire film that was truly interesting, and that was what happened to the grandmother and her lover at the end of the film. Strangely enough, it doesn't even seem to fit in, but it makes the loudest statement for understanding than anything else in the film. In fact, I wish the film had been about the grandmother and her lover... that would have truly been ground-breaking and intriguing.

    Very good film on human relationships. The ways people take care of each other, especially relations between parents and children. Honesty, loyalty, comprehension and affection. The most important thing is love. You receive it as much as you give, sometimes more than you give. Compare relationships of parents and children : Jeff and his dad, and Greg and his father on the other side. It's not only making children and raising them by putting them to school, there are also comprehension and affection that must be given to them. Let them know one cares about them, not only reproaching, but also explaining. In a word, always talking and keeping things clear and said. That's the way to do. Unfortunately few people follow this way. Hope this film would make them change a little if they saw it. For some,lucky parents and lucky children.

    The Australian film "The Sum of Us," which was adapted by David Stevens from his own play, portrays the close relationship between a widowed father and his openly gay son. Although the play has been "opened up" in terms of breaking out of the stage production's single set, Stevens has retained several scenes in which the characters talk directly to the audience. A gimmick even on stage, these actors' asides to the viewer intrude on the story and, in one particular instance, completely destroy the reality of the situation. When an actor addresses the audience, he is saying in effect "this is only a movie and I am only an actor playing a part." However, despite this flaw, which is a serious one, the film offers two fine performances by Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson and an often-memorable story of love and the search for love. Although Harry Mitchell, played by Thompson, is an incredibly tolerant and understanding father, he is the proverbial "too much of a good thing." In his seemingly endless desire to see his son find the right mate, he is intrusive, overbearing, and completely oblivious to his own meddling. However, Thompson is such an amiable actor and imbues the character with so much charm that the viewer, like his son, has to forgive him anything. In an early role, young Russell Crowe already shows his range as an actor. Clad in short cutoffs throughout most of the film, Crowe also displays his physical charms as well for interested fans.

Although Harry Mitchell, played by Thompson, is an incredibly tolerant and understanding father, he is the proverbial "too much of a good thing." In his seemingly endless desire to see his son find the right mate, he is intrusive, overbearing, and completely oblivious to his own meddling. However, Thompson is such an amiable actor and imbues the character with so much charm that the viewer, like his son, has to forgive him anything. In an early role, young Russell Crowe already shows his range as an actor. Clad in short cutoffs throughout most of the film, Crowe also displays his physical charms as well for interested fans. While his looks are not classically handsome, his appeal is undeniable, and, to his credit, he does not play the character of Jeff with any hint of stereotypical gay mannerisms, and he is not averse to displaying affection towards another man. Although the movie follows Jeff's search for Mr. Right and Harry's search for Miss Right, the most touching and haunting scenes in the film and the play before it relate to the relationship that Harry's mother had with a woman named Mary. The two women lived and loved each other for 40 years before well meaning, but unintentionally cruel, relatives separated them "for their own good." The separation of his mother and her lover haunts Harry with the thoughts of what the two women discussed on their last night together, knowing that it was the last time that they would see each other. On stage, the story of the two women brought the audience to tears. Related visually on screen, the episode will haunt viewers as much as it did Harry. While certainly not a classic or even a groundbreaking film, "The Sum of Us" is competent, entertaining, warm, and full of hope that the world is moving in the right direction.

    It's been a while, like some ten years now, that I discovered The Sum of Us VHS and fell for Russell. I now have a DVD with subtitles. I haven't seen some of his early films but contrary to the American generalized opinion, I dislike Gladiator and that seems like a heresy to so many people. Well, I'm glad to be that heretic ! I also disliked Cinderella Man. But I love others, like The Insider, Master and Commander and many others. Comments like I've read in so many pages of adoration and repulse are to me like everyone has a right to his own opinion. As for mine, I would like to be close to Russell this lifetime and maybe some of the next.

    I really loved this movie, not just because of the actors, but because the movie really goes to the heart of who we are as people, and shows how we all are part of each other. It is a touching and funny story of love and acceptance. Russell Crowe does a good job as the son, but Jack Thompson really is the star of the movie, his character is the heart of the show. Through him we see the world differently, and we see a parent who loves his child and only wants what is best for them. Many of us could learn some real lessons from this. The backdrop of Sydney adds a little extra charm, in that we see a part of the world with which most of us are not familiar. I have recommended this movie to many friends, and each of them has truly enjoyed the movie, and related to it.

    As a polemic to conservative Australians, it hammers the message home. It might have worked as a piece of theater but as a film it fails. Preaching to the converted? I think so. No sexual chemistry between the leads...neither gay or straight. Russell's helmet-head, hawk-nosed, super hair-sprayed boyfriend doesn't convince. Everyone tries hard and fails. It has a low-brow streak of melancholy running throughout. A bit like a soap without the continuity. That this qualifies for inclusion in the top 100 gay films of all time on AfterElton can only reflect low expectations. Wanted to like it but didn't. Disappointing

    A comedy, one more, in this life that is so little comic indeed. We start with the promise of a revolution coming through and we end with a request or piece of advice that you better be home soon, and in between, love, romance, tragedy and a lot of empathy and misery with a little bit of happiness sprinkled on top, at times angry happiness because of the silly decision you took and it broke the potential happy development you were hoping for and looking forward to getting on a silver platter. You just got Saint John the Baptist's head. We are dealing here with grown up men and women all in strange situations. A young gay man living with his parents and the father behaves as if he did not know and he turns ugly when it becomes news stuff on TV. Another gay man living with his widower of a father who is not gay but accepts his son the way he is though he is invasive, maybe an intrusive voyeur, and in a way blocks his son's way to happiness. That same man gets in touch with a lady through some meeting club and the two fall for one another but the night when things were going to go through, New Year's Eve, at his place, the son being out for his own fun, she comes across some gay magazines and cannot accept the fact that she had not been told before, and if she had it would not have changed anything because she just does not want to go across this line. Just minutes after she drove off, when the fireworks start celebrating the New Year, he has a savage and wild heart attack or stroke and he will remain paralyzed on one side and without the capability to speak any more. In other words she broke his heart and that is not a metaphor, she literally did break his heart, boom. That is sad, very sad, but it is a comedy, so there must be a happy ending and life will take care of some haphazard meeting of the two young men and then life will be on tracks again. But gosh it is not easy to build your own happiness when you are not a photocopy of the standard middle of the way unoriginal model imposed by ethical and moral norms in our society, even when things have changed legally. Between the law and reality there is more than a simple Strait of Malacca: there are thousands of hostile pirates with weapons everywhere up over their heads ready to raid your life to prevent you from being happy. Enjoy the details. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    This is an amazing movie. It digs into deep personal feelings, no matter if you're gay or not. It shows a beautiful side of being human. This movie talks about love. It is clich&eacute;, but it is so true. It talks about friendship with love, how important it is for most of us to have the right partner and the supportive family to be just happy. If you are not a fan of Russell Crowe, watch this movie anyway. It may give you another sight of his early career I was myself ignorant about. And I don't need to say how brilliant Thompson is. I wish the tale would have a longer time line, and talk about what happens after.

    What's this, Russell Crowe playing it gay in a low budget Australian flick, could that be true? It doesn't sound like it from the surface, but digging a little deeper and that really is exactly what you have in The Sum of Us, a freakishly good low budget movie from 1994. The Sum of Us is basically the sum of a story of looking for love, first the widowed dad is looking for love and his 'Miss Right' whilst his twentyish son is also looking for love, but in the shape of his 'Mr Right'. This surprisingly endearing movie made on a budget less than most films spend on catering and cakes, is a witty and funny tale of love and laughter. The Sum of Us is not your typical gay movie in that nobody is dying, activism is not on the menu, nor is there a historical horror or an aggressive and overbearing father preventing the closet door from opening and not even the slightest hint of drag! Nope, this is a good and happy sort of soft tale, which has some nice funny bits and a couple of tender scenes to pique the heartstrings. The Sum of Us is taken directly from the stage play, as such, some of the lines are more 'stagey' than 'filmy' but get over those, and you have a very enjoyable film. Funny, interesting, charming, touching and rather refreshingly free from overt stereotypes, which can dog so many other gay films.

    This movie took me by surprise, it is personable, sincere and utterly Australian. It explores its themes in a beautiful manner, through the relationships between family, especially father and son. Don't be put off by Russel Crowe. I myself almost didn't watch it because he was in it, but I have to say, he did a brilliant job. He took the character and made it his own, and I feel no one else could have played the part any better. Take into account that this movie was originally a stage play, so there are various monologues and direct engagement with the audience. This at first is a little surprising and perhaps even uncomfortable, as we are so used to being purely observers when watching a movie. After initial surprise however I found the technique refreshing, it gave the film a more personable and intimate quality. I revel in how Australian this film is, the fact that I use the same brands of mustard and soy sauce which at one point appeared at the dinner table, made me unusually delighted and also pulled me into the realism which the film tries and succeeds in conveying. At risk of sounding patriotic, it almost made me proud to be Australian. This is probably one of my favourite movies, in its exploration of love and how it should not be dictated by the limits of our society.

    Sorry to burst everyone's bubble, but personally I found this film to be an almost total embarrassment in every way. The father bursts in (TWICE!) on his son while he's trying to get it on with a new guy he's met. Is that believable? Hardly. It's the kind of thing that a ten year old brother might do, not a parent, especially a parent who is gay-positive and hoping that his son will meet someone and have a serious affair. It's almost as embarrassing to watch the father meet a woman through a dating agency. The two of them act like they are 15 years old... and totally unnatural at that. When he decides to propose to her he actually gets down on one knee. If it were done tongue in cheek, maybe I could accept it, but it's done straight (pardon the pun). This film also has the bad habit of having the actors turn towards the camera and talk to the audience directly. Once or twice, maybe, but over and over again it totally breaks up the film and destroys any possibility of allowing the audience to get emotionally into what is happening. The worst moment in the film is when the father has had a stroke and is lying almost paralyzed in his bed. The son goes to get something, leaving the father alone, and all of a sudden he stops lying there like a vegetable, smiles, and starts chatting to the audience. It totally destroys any semblance of continuity and becomes annoying as hell by the end of the film. I suppose it's nice to have a film where some of the parents are understanding and (too) helpful to the gay son for a change, but does it have to be so adolescent in its presentation? There was only one thing in the entire film that was truly interesting, and that was what happened to the grandmother and her lover at the end of the film. Strangely enough, it doesn't even seem to fit in, but it makes the loudest statement for understanding than anything else in the film. In fact, I wish the film had been about the grandmother and her lover... that would have truly been ground-breaking and intriguing.

    Very good film on human relationships. The ways people take care of each other, especially relations between parents and children. Honesty, loyalty, comprehension and affection. The most important thing is love. You receive it as much as you give, sometimes more than you give. Compare relationships of parents and children : Jeff and his dad, and Greg and his father on the other side. It's not only making children and raising them by putting them to school, there are also comprehension and affection that must be given to them. Let them know one cares about them, not only reproaching, but also explaining. In a word, always talking and keeping things clear and said. That's the way to do. Unfortunately few people follow this way. Hope this film would make them change a little if they saw it. For some,lucky parents and lucky children.

    The Australian film "The Sum of Us," which was adapted by David Stevens from his own play, portrays the close relationship between a widowed father and his openly gay son. Although the play has been "opened up" in terms of breaking out of the stage production's single set, Stevens has retained several scenes in which the characters talk directly to the audience. A gimmick even on stage, these actors' asides to the viewer intrude on the story and, in one particular instance, completely destroy the reality of the situation. When an actor addresses the audience, he is saying in effect "this is only a movie and I am only an actor playing a part." However, despite this flaw, which is a serious one, the film offers two fine performances by Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson and an often-memorable story of love and the search for love. Although Harry Mitchell, played by Thompson, is an incredibly tolerant and understanding father, he is the proverbial "too much of a good thing."

A gimmick even on stage, these actors' asides to the viewer intrude on the story and, in one particular instance, completely destroy the reality of the situation. When an actor addresses the audience, he is saying in effect "this is only a movie and I am only an actor playing a part." However, despite this flaw, which is a serious one, the film offers two fine performances by Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson and an often-memorable story of love and the search for love. Although Harry Mitchell, played by Thompson, is an incredibly tolerant and understanding father, he is the proverbial "too much of a good thing." In his seemingly endless desire to see his son find the right mate, he is intrusive, overbearing, and completely oblivious to his own meddling. However, Thompson is such an amiable actor and imbues the character with so much charm that the viewer, like his son, has to forgive him anything. In an early role, young Russell Crowe already shows his range as an actor. Clad in short cutoffs throughout most of the film, Crowe also displays his physical charms as well for interested fans. While his looks are not classically handsome, his appeal is undeniable, and, to his credit, he does not play the character of Jeff with any hint of stereotypical gay mannerisms, and he is not averse to displaying affection towards another man. Although the movie follows Jeff's search for Mr. Right and Harry's search for Miss Right, the most touching and haunting scenes in the film and the play before it relate to the relationship that Harry's mother had with a woman named Mary. The two women lived and loved each other for 40 years before well meaning, but unintentionally cruel, relatives separated them "for their own good." The separation of his mother and her lover haunts Harry with the thoughts of what the two women discussed on their last night together, knowing that it was the last time that they would see each other. On stage, the story of the two women brought the audience to tears. Related visually on screen, the episode will haunt viewers as much as it did Harry. While certainly not a classic or even a groundbreaking film, "The Sum of Us" is competent, entertaining, warm, and full of hope that the world is moving in the right direction.

    It's been a while, like some ten years now, that I discovered The Sum of Us VHS and fell for Russell. I now have a DVD with subtitles. I haven't seen some of his early films but contrary to the American generalized opinion, I dislike Gladiator and that seems like a heresy to so many people. Well, I'm glad to be that heretic ! I also disliked Cinderella Man. But I love others, like The Insider, Master and Commander and many others. Comments like I've read in so many pages of adoration and repulse are to me like everyone has a right to his own opinion. As for mine, I would like to be close to Russell this lifetime and maybe some of the next.

    I really loved this movie, not just because of the actors, but because the movie really goes to the heart of who we are as people, and shows how we all are part of each other. It is a touching and funny story of love and acceptance. Russell Crowe does a good job as the son, but Jack Thompson really is the star of the movie, his character is the heart of the show. Through him we see the world differently, and we see a parent who loves his child and only wants what is best for them. Many of us could learn some real lessons from this. The backdrop of Sydney adds a little extra charm, in that we see a part of the world with which most of us are not familiar. I have recommended this movie to many friends, and each of them has truly enjoyed the movie, and related to it.

    As a polemic to conservative Australians, it hammers the message home. It might have worked as a piece of theater but as a film it fails. Preaching to the converted? I think so. No sexual chemistry between the leads...neither gay or straight. Russell's helmet-head, hawk-nosed, super hair-sprayed boyfriend doesn't convince. Everyone tries hard and fails. It has a low-brow streak of melancholy running throughout. A bit like a soap without the continuity. That this qualifies for inclusion in the top 100 gay films of all time on AfterElton can only reflect low expectations. Wanted to like it but didn't. Disappointing

    A comedy, one more, in this life that is so little comic indeed. We start with the promise of a revolution coming through and we end with a request or piece of advice that you better be home soon, and in between, love, romance, tragedy and a lot of empathy and misery with a little bit of happiness sprinkled on top, at times angry happiness because of the silly decision you took and it broke the potential happy development you were hoping for and looking forward to getting on a silver platter. You just got Saint John the Baptist's head. We are dealing here with grown up men and women all in strange situations. A young gay man living with his parents and the father behaves as if he did not know and he turns ugly when it becomes news stuff on TV. Another gay man living with his widower of a father who is not gay but accepts his son the way he is though he is invasive, maybe an intrusive voyeur, and in a way blocks his son's way to happiness. That same man gets in touch with a lady through some meeting club and the two fall for one another but the night when things were going to go through, New Year's Eve, at his place, the son being out for his own fun, she comes across some gay magazines and cannot accept the fact that she had not been told before, and if she had it would not have changed anything because she just does not want to go across this line. Just minutes after she drove off, when the fireworks start celebrating the New Year, he has a savage and wild heart attack or stroke and he will remain paralyzed on one side and without the capability to speak any more. In other words she broke his heart and that is not a metaphor, she literally did break his heart, boom. That is sad, very sad, but it is a comedy, so there must be a happy ending and life will take care of some haphazard meeting of the two young men and then life will be on tracks again. But gosh it is not easy to build your own happiness when you are not a photocopy of the standard middle of the way unoriginal model imposed by ethical and moral norms in our society, even when things have changed legally. Between the law and reality there is more than a simple Strait of Malacca: there are thousands of hostile pirates with weapons everywhere up over their heads ready to raid your life to prevent you from being happy. Enjoy the details. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    This is an amazing movie. It digs into deep personal feelings, no matter if you're gay or not. It shows a beautiful side of being human. This movie talks about love. It is clich&eacute;, but it is so true. It talks about friendship with love, how important it is for most of us to have the right partner and the supportive family to be just happy. If you are not a fan of Russell Crowe, watch this movie anyway. It may give you another sight of his early career I was myself ignorant about. And I don't need to say how brilliant Thompson is. I wish the tale would have a longer time line, and talk about what happens after.

    What's this, Russell Crowe playing it gay in a low budget Australian flick, could that be true? It doesn't sound like it from the surface, but digging a little deeper and that really is exactly what you have in The Sum of Us, a freakishly good low budget movie from 1994. The Sum of Us is basically the sum of a story of looking for love, first the widowed dad is looking for love and his 'Miss Right' whilst his twentyish son is also looking for love, but in the shape of his 'Mr Right'. This surprisingly endearing movie made on a budget less than most films spend on catering and cakes, is a witty and funny tale of love and laughter. The Sum of Us is not your typical gay movie in that nobody is dying, activism is not on the menu, nor is there a historical horror or an aggressive and overbearing father preventing the closet door from opening and not even the slightest hint of drag! Nope, this is a good and happy sort of soft tale, which has some nice funny bits and a couple of tender scenes to pique the heartstrings. The Sum of Us is taken directly from the stage play, as such, some of the lines are more 'stagey' than 'filmy' but get over those, and you have a very enjoyable film. Funny, interesting, charming, touching and rather refreshingly free from overt stereotypes, which can dog so many other gay films.

    This movie took me by surprise, it is personable, sincere and utterly Australian. It explores its themes in a beautiful manner, through the relationships between family, especially father and son. Don't be put off by Russel Crowe. I myself almost didn't watch it because he was in it, but I have to say, he did a brilliant job. He took the character and made it his own, and I feel no one else could have played the part any better. Take into account that this movie was originally a stage play, so there are various monologues and direct engagement with the audience. This at first is a little surprising and perhaps even uncomfortable, as we are so used to being purely observers when watching a movie. After initial surprise however I found the technique refreshing, it gave the film a more personable and intimate quality. I revel in how Australian this film is, the fact that I use the same brands of mustard and soy sauce which at one point appeared at the dinner table, made me unusually delighted and also pulled me into the realism which the film tries and succeeds in conveying. At risk of sounding patriotic, it almost made me proud to be Australian. This is probably one of my favourite movies, in its exploration of love and how it should not be dictated by the limits of our society.

    Sorry to burst everyone's bubble, but personally I found this film to be an almost total embarrassment in every way. The father bursts in (TWICE!) on his son while he's trying to get it on with a new guy he's met. Is that believable? Hardly. It's the kind of thing that a ten year old brother might do, not a parent, especially a parent who is gay-positive and hoping that his son will meet someone and have a serious affair. It's almost as embarrassing to watch the father meet a woman through a dating agency. The two of them act like they are 15 years old... and totally unnatural at that. When he decides to propose to her he actually gets down on one knee. If it were done tongue in cheek, maybe I could accept it, but it's done straight (pardon the pun). This film also has the bad habit of having the actors turn towards the camera and talk to the audience directly. Once or twice, maybe, but over and over again it totally breaks up the film and destroys any possibility of allowing the audience to get emotionally into what is happening. The worst moment in the film is when the father has had a stroke and is lying almost paralyzed in his bed. The son goes to get something, leaving the father alone, and all of a sudden he stops lying there like a vegetable, smiles, and starts chatting to the audience. It totally destroys any semblance of continuity and becomes annoying as hell by the end of the film. I suppose it's nice to have a film where some of the parents are understanding and (too) helpful to the gay son for a change, but does it have to be so adolescent in its presentation? There was only one thing in the entire film that was truly interesting, and that was what happened to the grandmother and her lover at the end of the film. Strangely enough, it doesn't even seem to fit in, but it makes the loudest statement for understanding than anything else in the film. In fact, I wish the film had been about the grandmother and her lover... that would have truly been ground-breaking and intriguing.

    Very good film on human relationships. The ways people take care of each other, especially relations between parents and children. Honesty, loyalty, comprehension and affection. The most important thing is love. You receive it as much as you give, sometimes more than you give. Compare relationships of parents and children : Jeff and his dad, and Greg and his father on the other side. It's not only making children and raising them by putting them to school, there are also comprehension and affection that must be given to them. Let them know one cares about them, not only reproaching, but also explaining. In a word, always talking and keeping things clear and said. That's the way to do. Unfortunately few people follow this way. Hope this film would make them change a little if they saw it. For some,lucky parents and lucky children.
