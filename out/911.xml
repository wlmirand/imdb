    Heavyweight stars working on a weightless plot yet doing some good for us and themselves. That can be said of many movies and also about "Twilight". No, this isn't Team Edward or Team Jacob, it's a film noir about wrapped in secrets, ghosts from the past and some skeletons in the closet (more like on a swimming pool!). On the front seat of this we have the team Paul Newman and director Robert Benton, re-teaming after the successful "Nobody's Fool"; and the amazing passengers of this are Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Giancarlo Esposito, Reese Witherspoon, Liev Schreiber, John Spencer, Margo Martindale and M. Emmet Walsh (horribly reduced to a pivotal role but with no speaking lines). Newman plays Harry, a veteran private detective in the twilight of his career and years, decadent and living of favors in the house of Jack Ames, a dying veteran actor (Hackman) and his wife (Sarandon), also an actress, doing some jobs here and there for them, covering up their dirt. Then, during one of those "jobs", after almost getting killed by another detective, he decides to check out what's behind the many out-coming mysteries which are appearing on his way, things that might have to do with his past and also things from the past of his bosses/friends. Favorable point for him: the unusual help of a sidekick (Esposito) - in terms of script kind of strange but it works well. Low point for him: flames getting higher between him and Ames wife; her brat daughter (Witherspoon) whose purpose is to put the man down just because she doesn't like him, due to an incident involving her boyfriend (Schreiber). Fine movie but quite cheap if you think about all the elements involved. Quite simplified as noir don't tend to be, convoluted in so many dialogs and never all that interesting or clever, "Twilight" begs for our attention but doesn't give much in return. When you see the mystery close of getting solved, already figuring out who's the bad guy, you end up asking yourself "Why should I care about this story?". Well, you should care but the movie doesn't impels you in such direction. You're there for the actors and that sometimes works replacing the excitement, the thrills, the action, everything that is missing here. While it feeds us with Newman giving an outstanding performance, it doesn't offer much when it comes to show the other actors, most of them reduced to a few scenes (Garner stands out with perfection though). Once again we see Newman's character trying to show he can hit the top of his craft even though he's not fast and younger as before, realizing that things have changed but he still can find a way to do something. But he played this several times before and in better projects ("The Verdict", "Nobody's Fool" and his Oscar winning Eddie Felson in "The Color of Money"). Sarandon brings lots of sensuality in her role but at times it seems director Benton and his writing partner Richard Russo are forcing things far too much when it comes to presenting those sexy moments. Hackman was a little underused in this, but presents some class act during his first scenes. Conclusion: it's not fun as it could and should be but it's watchable. Rare times a good team like this were gathered and could make something decent out of a movie. 7/10

    I like noir films in general but the pacing of certain scenes tends to be very slow and contrivances such as Sarandon's cigarette dialogue/fumbling exaggerates and amplifies the slowness; I suppose this pacing is intended to impart to the audience a feeling of importance/seriousness to the scene but it does just the opposite. I was surprised to read the budget for this film was $37 million because the production values don't seem to be that high --- apparently lots of money going to actors' salaries. Plot hole observation: Newman shoots and kills Garner in Garner's home; Newman apparently explains it away to the police as self defense because he was about to expose Garner as a murderer; the now dead Garner has no way to defend himself, and irregardless of this fact, the police swallow whole Newman's suspicious story (which, oops, happens to be the main premise of the screenplay) and let him go free. I know if I shot and killed someone in their house without clear motive I wouldn't be walking free anytime soon.

    Twilight is directed by Robert Benton who also co-writes the screenplay with Richard Russo. It stars Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Reese Witherspoon, Giancarlo Esposito and Liev Schreiber. Music is scored by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski. Harry Ross (Newman) is working for Jack (Hackman) and Catherine Ames (Sarandon). When one day he is sent to deliver a package for Jack, it turns out to be the starting point of trouble that opens up a 20 year old missing persons case involving Catherine's ex-husband. Twilight, the word in this case signifying persons in the twilight of their lives, is on the surface a standard murder mystery infused with noirish blood. But although the film never gets above a steady beat, where subtlety of performances and tone are key, it's a better picture than the poor box office it garnered suggests. However, in spite of the quality that comes with said performances and script, the latter sinewy and begging for the mature film fan's attention, picture is a little too subtle for its own good. When action does come into play it feels like an intrusion, misplaced even, which shouldn't be the case as there is, after all, a suspected murder and private investigation going on in the plot. The blend isn't quite right in spite of the intelligence and thought that's gone in to make the characters engaging. The whole calm over chaos approach taken by Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer) is however admirable, many people like dialogue driven movies, especially ones dripping with noir atmospherics, myself included, but it does put itself out as being only accessible to a select audience. That's why it failed at the box office; well that and the fact that this A list cast of some distinction meant expectations went through the roof prior to its release! But there's still much to enjoy as the seasoned performers dally around themes of mortality, loyalty and forbidden fruit, with the rose tinted cloud of nostalgia hovering constantly over head. It's apt that the film clearly harks back to noirish movies of yesterday, for its main characters are forced to constantly look backwards, to times passed, times never to be had again. The good far outweighs the bad here, but you need to be in a select band of film lovers to get the best rewards from it. 7/10

    I found this story of an aging private eye (Paul Newman in yet another terrific late-career performance), and his aging friends, lovers and clients (Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, all doing admirable work) touching, sweet, funny, sad, and an enjoyable noir mystery to boot. Its not that the plotting is that brilliant, or the story that novel, but this is really more about the characters than the mystery anyway. Its about aging and loss and trying to hold onto your pride and self-esteem in the face of the indignities later life. In all that it has much in common with Benton"s earlier, very good "Late Show", but for me this had even more depth and resonance (perhaps reflective of Benton"s own aging?).

    Paul Newman, director Robert Benton, and scriptwriter Richard Russo gets reassembled for this L.A. detective drama together with an talented stars headed by Susan Sarandon,Gene Hackman,James Garner,Stockard Channing and Reese Witherspoon in this thriller/noir film,Twilight. The story focuses on aging private detective Harry Ross,an ex-cop, is working on a case to return 17-year-old Mel Ames to her home. He tracks down Mel and her sleazy boyfriend,Jeff Willis, at a motel.Two years go by. Ross is living in southern California in the guest quarters of Mel's wealthy parents, Jack and Catherine Ames. One day, Jack asks a favor of Harryto deliver a package. It turns out to be the first development in a series of twists and turns in a 20- year-old case involving the disappearance of Catherine's ex-husband. A man named Ivar is murdered at the proposed meeting place where Harry was to bring the package. Harry is detained by police, including a close friend, Lt. Verna Hollander. At the police station, he runs into another old pal and colleague, now retired, Raymond Hope. Harry has a developing interest in Catherine and ends up in bed with her one night. He also is blackmailed by a parole officer called Mucho and by Mel's old boyfriend, Jeff, now an ex-con.A dying Jack Ames feels betrayed that Harry has had a fling with his wife. Harry, meanwhile, is forced to face the reality that his friends have been deceitful and manipulative of him.Raymond Hope tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all, but showdown ensues in Raymond's glass-walled hillside home. The movie has a great cast headed by Newman,Sarandon and Hackman.Unfortunately,the intelligent script isn't engaging enough to keep the viewer tuned in as the plot is lacking in energy and interest.The talent of the excellent cast is what made up for the movie and saved it from complete ruin.But nevertheless,the actors/actresses tried their best to make the most out of the screenplay and the final product turned out to be better than average.Overall,Twilight is a movie that has an excellent cast in a lifeless screenplay still deserves a 9 out of 10 rating.

    Not the terrible 'Teen Vampire' nonsense but an excellently acted 'Noir' with Paul Newman as an over the hill retired ex-cop and former private eye who resides with a actor friend (Gene Hackman) who is dying from cancer and his seductive actress wife (Susan Sarandon) Newman is requested by Hackman to run an 'errand' unbeknown to him he becomes embroiled in murder. He stumbles into a mysterious 20 year old case which deals with the disappearance of Sarandon's former husband. 'Twilight' has an excellent cast, on top of having Hackman, Sarandon, theirs an appearance from James Garner, who also has shady dealings. Liev Schrieber and Reese Whitherspoon also appear the latter contributes a revealing nude scene at the beginning.

    Reese Whitherspoon is topless in this movie and it is thoroughly gratuitous. Unlike most young actresses, however, at least Whitherspoon can look back and know she was exploited in a quality film while she was working with some of the best performers of a generation and one of the biggest movie stars of all time. Harry Ross (Paul Newman) used to be a cop and, after that, used to be a private investigator. But after a job down in Mexico bringing back the rebellious daughter of an aging movie star named Jack Ames (Gene Hackman), Harry gets shot. Ames takes Harry into his home while he recovers, then keeps him around as a handyman and family friend. Two years after the Mexico mess, the cancer-stricken Ames asks Harry to deliver an envelope for him. When he takes it to the instructed address, Harry nearly gets shot by a guy who was himself shot in the gut sometime before Harry arrived. Harry manages to just barely avoid getting killed until the guy dies, after which he discovers the man was named Lester Ivar (M. Emmet Walsh). I var was another former cop turned private eye and Harry learns that Ivar was continuing to investigate the disappearance of a actor 20 years ago. That actor was the then-husband of Jack Ames' current wife Catherine (Susan Sarandon). It seems the actor disappeared just in time to clear the way for Catherine to leave him for Jack. And if you think you know where the story is going based on that little plot twist, you're right. That is where the story goes. Harry's investigation into who killed Ivar, who's blackmailing Jack Ames and what happened to Catherine's first husband brings him into contact with another old private eye buddy (James Garner) and an old flame on the police force (Stockard Channing) before culminating in the sort of darkly hopeful ending that the best film noir always aspires to pull off. This is a very good movie. As I mentioned earlier, it's not much of a mystery. You might not be able to guess every single detail of the story before it unfolds, but you figure out early on how it's going to play out and even how it will likely end up. There's very little "whodunit" going on here, but that's not a problem. This isn't a movie about how a mystery gets solved. It's about the people caught up in it. The actors in Twilight are every bit as good as you could expect or want with performers of this caliber. Whitherspoon gives the weakest performance of the lot, but what young woman could measure up to the veteran talent in this cast? Newman, Sarandon, Hackman, Garner and Channing all do superb work as those rarest of all Hollywood movie characters  grown ups. These aren't old people tagging along in a young person's world and they aren't characters who behave a decade or two younger and stupider than they actually are. These are people with histories that define then and histories they sometimes struggle to overcome. Newman and Hackman are especially marvelous to watch as two men who both know the thread of their life is running thin and are readying themselves for that end. Even though you know where the story is going, it's a great pleasure to watch these characters get there. Twilight is quite a nice film with lots of real human emotion, humor and drama. It takes a very down-to-Earth approach to desperate acts and how they can shape people's lives, in contrast to many films where it seems like every aspect of existence is heightened and exaggerated to ridiculous levels. Newman made a handful of enjoyable and classy movies like Twilight at the end of his career and they serve as a worthy capstone to his remarkable achievements.

    The late actor Paul Newman portrays a fly in the ointment, the anti-hero version of Dick Tracy, herein Twilight. I've read some reviews of people wondering why widely acclaimed filmmaker Robert Benton has made this movie. A short answer: To provide screen experience to new starlets with veteran actors. There are 3 of those starlets in this film. First one is Reese Witherspoon. 1998 was an important milestone for her. She's been busy whole year long with Pleasantville and Overnight Delivery. Through 1998 summer she played in Twilight, thus she has bold scenes with Liev Schreiber. Even though she has a cameo role as Mel Ames in the film, her role includes the only nudity content of her box-office movies career. Yet, Twilight features its queen Susan Sarandon. For me, this is Sarandon's third best after Atlantic City and White Palace. She comes out of pool, starts walking in Eve outlook, looking for her Adam, then Newman comes by. The second starlet is Liev Schreiber. He plays Mel's date at Mexico. While Mel lies naked on a couch, she asks him "Do you love me?". He keeps his silence a bit while staring at her tits, and hinders himself from replying "No, I just love your tits". Thankfully Mel speaks before him: "I mean it doesn't really matter you love me or not". If all the movie critics thought the same way that Robert Benton has written the worst script of his life, they might be right. The third starlet is Patrick Malone. If you read this review right now, and don't know who Patrick Malone is, it's because herein Twilight he wasted his chance of a lifetime due to his imitation of Will Smith. A young actor in Hollywood must not copy other actors of same career level. I actually liked Malone's harmony with Newman playing his partner, if only he could have played his own style. He was one of the supporting actors in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon(1991). Even though the cast is rich on paper, the whole plot is turning around Paul Newman. No one is able to come closer to him, and he acts only with his self-belief. From my point of view, the main issue is not the script nor the cheapness of the story telling methods. Nobody but Benton and Newman, is in the mood of making a movie. Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing spoil the story. So many stars make it darker. Only Newman and Sarandon could have been enough to fill the cast, since the storyline is so simple.

    These excellent actors did what they could with the script which is what brings the rating down. I like film noir, Susan Sarandon, Paul Newman and Gene Hackman. Excellent supporting roles from Stockard Channing, James Garner, Reese Witherspoon (showing more than she does now) and Liev Shriber. POSSIBLE SPOILER: A aging private eye (Newman) has some dirty work to do for Hackman. In doing this, he uncovers a long held secret and not so nice things about Hackman and Sarandon. While not the most original of plots, watching these film legends is indeed a trip down memory lane of the Bogarts, Becalls et al. And how interesting was it that Stockard Channing and John Spencer (of West Wing fame) are teamed up here? Good solid film noir. Recommended despite dialog flaws.

    Newman, in a role similar to "Harper," is a has-been private detective living with and helping out aging movie actors Hackman and Sarandon. The script is rather convoluted and ultimately less than satisfying. However, it is a pleasure to watch old pros like Newman, Hackman, and Garner, each about seventy at the time of this film. Comparatively, Sarandon and Channing are spry young things in their fifties. The impressive cast also features up-and-coming stars like Witherspoon and Schreiber. Benton, who co-wrote the script, creates a nice atmosphere, aided by one of Bernstein's last scores. Given such an assemblage of talent, the film is a disappointment.

A man named Ivar is murdered at the proposed meeting place where Harry was to bring the package. Harry is detained by police, including a close friend, Lt. Verna Hollander. At the police station, he runs into another old pal and colleague, now retired, Raymond Hope. Harry has a developing interest in Catherine and ends up in bed with her one night. He also is blackmailed by a parole officer called Mucho and by Mel's old boyfriend, Jeff, now an ex-con.A dying Jack Ames feels betrayed that Harry has had a fling with his wife. Harry, meanwhile, is forced to face the reality that his friends have been deceitful and manipulative of him.Raymond Hope tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all, but showdown ensues in Raymond's glass-walled hillside home. The movie has a great cast headed by Newman,Sarandon and Hackman.Unfortunately,the intelligent script isn't engaging enough to keep the viewer tuned in as the plot is lacking in energy and interest.The talent of the excellent cast is what made up for the movie and saved it from complete ruin.But nevertheless,the actors/actresses tried their best to make the most out of the screenplay and the final product turned out to be better than average.Overall,Twilight is a movie that has an excellent cast in a lifeless screenplay still deserves a 9 out of 10 rating.

He stumbles into a mysterious 20 year old case which deals with the disappearance of Sarandon's former husband. 'Twilight' has an excellent cast, on top of having Hackman, Sarandon, theirs an appearance from James Garner, who also has shady dealings. Liev Schrieber and Reese Whitherspoon also appear the latter contributes a revealing nude scene at the beginning.

    Reese Whitherspoon is topless in this movie and it is thoroughly gratuitous. Unlike most young actresses, however, at least Whitherspoon can look back and know she was exploited in a quality film while she was working with some of the best performers of a generation and one of the biggest movie stars of all time. Harry Ross (Paul Newman) used to be a cop and, after that, used to be a private investigator. But after a job down in Mexico bringing back the rebellious daughter of an aging movie star named Jack Ames (Gene Hackman), Harry gets shot. Ames takes Harry into his home while he recovers, then keeps him around as a handyman and family friend. Two years after the Mexico mess, the cancer-stricken Ames asks Harry to deliver an envelope for him. When he takes it to the instructed address, Harry nearly gets shot by a guy who was himself shot in the gut sometime before Harry arrived. Harry manages to just barely avoid getting killed until the guy dies, after which he discovers the man was named Lester Ivar (M. Emmet Walsh). I var was another former cop turned private eye and Harry learns that Ivar was continuing to investigate the disappearance of a actor 20 years ago. That actor was the then-husband of Jack Ames' current wife Catherine (Susan Sarandon). It seems the actor disappeared just in time to clear the way for Catherine to leave him for Jack. And if you think you know where the story is going based on that little plot twist, you're right. That is where the story goes. Harry's investigation into who killed Ivar, who's blackmailing Jack Ames and what happened to Catherine's first husband brings him into contact with another old private eye buddy (James Garner) and an old flame on the police force (Stockard Channing) before culminating in the sort of darkly hopeful ending that the best film noir always aspires to pull off. This is a very good movie. As I mentioned earlier, it's not much of a mystery. You might not be able to guess every single detail of the story before it unfolds, but you figure out early on how it's going to play out and even how it will likely end up. There's very little "whodunit" going on here, but that's not a problem. This isn't a movie about how a mystery gets solved. It's about the people caught up in it. The actors in Twilight are every bit as good as you could expect or want with performers of this caliber. Whitherspoon gives the weakest performance of the lot, but what young woman could measure up to the veteran talent in this cast? Newman, Sarandon, Hackman, Garner and Channing all do superb work as those rarest of all Hollywood movie characters  grown ups. These aren't old people tagging along in a young person's world and they aren't characters who behave a decade or two younger and stupider than they actually are. These are people with histories that define then and histories they sometimes struggle to overcome. Newman and Hackman are especially marvelous to watch as two men who both know the thread of their life is running thin and are readying themselves for that end. Even though you know where the story is going, it's a great pleasure to watch these characters get there. Twilight is quite a nice film with lots of real human emotion, humor and drama. It takes a very down-to-Earth approach to desperate acts and how they can shape people's lives, in contrast to many films where it seems like every aspect of existence is heightened and exaggerated to ridiculous levels. Newman made a handful of enjoyable and classy movies like Twilight at the end of his career and they serve as a worthy capstone to his remarkable achievements.

    The late actor Paul Newman portrays a fly in the ointment, the anti-hero version of Dick Tracy, herein Twilight. I've read some reviews of people wondering why widely acclaimed filmmaker Robert Benton has made this movie. A short answer: To provide screen experience to new starlets with veteran actors. There are 3 of those starlets in this film. First one is Reese Witherspoon. 1998 was an important milestone for her. She's been busy whole year long with Pleasantville and Overnight Delivery. Through 1998 summer she played in Twilight, thus she has bold scenes with Liev Schreiber. Even though she has a cameo role as Mel Ames in the film, her role includes the only nudity content of her box-office movies career. Yet, Twilight features its queen Susan Sarandon. For me, this is Sarandon's third best after Atlantic City and White Palace. She comes out of pool, starts walking in Eve outlook, looking for her Adam, then Newman comes by. The second starlet is Liev Schreiber. He plays Mel's date at Mexico. While Mel lies naked on a couch, she asks him "Do you love me?". He keeps his silence a bit while staring at her tits, and hinders himself from replying "No, I just love your tits". Thankfully Mel speaks before him: "I mean it doesn't really matter you love me or not". If all the movie critics thought the same way that Robert Benton has written the worst script of his life, they might be right. The third starlet is Patrick Malone. If you read this review right now, and don't know who Patrick Malone is, it's because herein Twilight he wasted his chance of a lifetime due to his imitation of Will Smith. A young actor in Hollywood must not copy other actors of same career level. I actually liked Malone's harmony with Newman playing his partner, if only he could have played his own style. He was one of the supporting actors in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon(1991). Even though the cast is rich on paper, the whole plot is turning around Paul Newman. No one is able to come closer to him, and he acts only with his self-belief. From my point of view, the main issue is not the script nor the cheapness of the story telling methods. Nobody but Benton and Newman, is in the mood of making a movie. Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing spoil the story. So many stars make it darker. Only Newman and Sarandon could have been enough to fill the cast, since the storyline is so simple.

    These excellent actors did what they could with the script which is what brings the rating down. I like film noir, Susan Sarandon, Paul Newman and Gene Hackman. Excellent supporting roles from Stockard Channing, James Garner, Reese Witherspoon (showing more than she does now) and Liev Shriber. POSSIBLE SPOILER: A aging private eye (Newman) has some dirty work to do for Hackman. In doing this, he uncovers a long held secret and not so nice things about Hackman and Sarandon. While not the most original of plots, watching these film legends is indeed a trip down memory lane of the Bogarts, Becalls et al. And how interesting was it that Stockard Channing and John Spencer (of West Wing fame) are teamed up here? Good solid film noir. Recommended despite dialog flaws.

    Newman, in a role similar to "Harper," is a has-been private detective living with and helping out aging movie actors Hackman and Sarandon. The script is rather convoluted and ultimately less than satisfying. However, it is a pleasure to watch old pros like Newman, Hackman, and Garner, each about seventy at the time of this film. Comparatively, Sarandon and Channing are spry young things in their fifties. The impressive cast also features up-and-coming stars like Witherspoon and Schreiber. Benton, who co-wrote the script, creates a nice atmosphere, aided by one of Bernstein's last scores. Given such an assemblage of talent, the film is a disappointment.

    Heavyweight stars working on a weightless plot yet doing some good for us and themselves. That can be said of many movies and also about "Twilight". No, this isn't Team Edward or Team Jacob, it's a film noir about wrapped in secrets, ghosts from the past and some skeletons in the closet (more like on a swimming pool!). On the front seat of this we have the team Paul Newman and director Robert Benton, re-teaming after the successful "Nobody's Fool"; and the amazing passengers of this are Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Giancarlo Esposito, Reese Witherspoon, Liev Schreiber, John Spencer, Margo Martindale and M. Emmet Walsh (horribly reduced to a pivotal role but with no speaking lines). Newman plays Harry, a veteran private detective in the twilight of his career and years, decadent and living of favors in the house of Jack Ames, a dying veteran actor (Hackman) and his wife (Sarandon), also an actress, doing some jobs here and there for them, covering up their dirt. Then, during one of those "jobs", after almost getting killed by another detective, he decides to check out what's behind the many out-coming mysteries which are appearing on his way, things that might have to do with his past and also things from the past of his bosses/friends. Favorable point for him: the unusual help of a sidekick (Esposito) - in terms of script kind of strange but it works well. Low point for him: flames getting higher between him and Ames wife; her brat daughter (Witherspoon) whose purpose is to put the man down just because she doesn't like him, due to an incident involving her boyfriend (Schreiber). Fine movie but quite cheap if you think about all the elements involved. Quite simplified as noir don't tend to be, convoluted in so many dialogs and never all that interesting or clever, "Twilight" begs for our attention but doesn't give much in return. When you see the mystery close of getting solved, already figuring out who's the bad guy, you end up asking yourself "Why should I care about this story?". Well, you should care but the movie doesn't impels you in such direction. You're there for the actors and that sometimes works replacing the excitement, the thrills, the action, everything that is missing here. While it feeds us with Newman giving an outstanding performance, it doesn't offer much when it comes to show the other actors, most of them reduced to a few scenes (Garner stands out with perfection though). Once again we see Newman's character trying to show he can hit the top of his craft even though he's not fast and younger as before, realizing that things have changed but he still can find a way to do something. But he played this several times before and in better projects ("The Verdict", "Nobody's Fool" and his Oscar winning Eddie Felson in "The Color of Money"). Sarandon brings lots of sensuality in her role but at times it seems director Benton and his writing partner Richard Russo are forcing things far too much when it comes to presenting those sexy moments. Hackman was a little underused in this, but presents some class act during his first scenes. Conclusion: it's not fun as it could and should be but it's watchable. Rare times a good team like this were gathered and could make something decent out of a movie. 7/10

    I like noir films in general but the pacing of certain scenes tends to be very slow and contrivances such as Sarandon's cigarette dialogue/fumbling exaggerates and amplifies the slowness; I suppose this pacing is intended to impart to the audience a feeling of importance/seriousness to the scene but it does just the opposite. I was surprised to read the budget for this film was $37 million because the production values don't seem to be that high --- apparently lots of money going to actors' salaries. Plot hole observation: Newman shoots and kills Garner in Garner's home; Newman apparently explains it away to the police as self defense because he was about to expose Garner as a murderer; the now dead Garner has no way to defend himself, and irregardless of this fact, the police swallow whole Newman's suspicious story (which, oops, happens to be the main premise of the screenplay) and let him go free. I know if I shot and killed someone in their house without clear motive I wouldn't be walking free anytime soon.

    Twilight is directed by Robert Benton who also co-writes the screenplay with Richard Russo. It stars Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Reese Witherspoon, Giancarlo Esposito and Liev Schreiber. Music is scored by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski. Harry Ross (Newman) is working for Jack (Hackman) and Catherine Ames (Sarandon). When one day he is sent to deliver a package for Jack, it turns out to be the starting point of trouble that opens up a 20 year old missing persons case involving Catherine's ex-husband. Twilight, the word in this case signifying persons in the twilight of their lives, is on the surface a standard murder mystery infused with noirish blood. But although the film never gets above a steady beat, where subtlety of performances and tone are key, it's a better picture than the poor box office it garnered suggests. However, in spite of the quality that comes with said performances and script, the latter sinewy and begging for the mature film fan's attention, picture is a little too subtle for its own good. When action does come into play it feels like an intrusion, misplaced even, which shouldn't be the case as there is, after all, a suspected murder and private investigation going on in the plot. The blend isn't quite right in spite of the intelligence and thought that's gone in to make the characters engaging. The whole calm over chaos approach taken by Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer) is however admirable, many people like dialogue driven movies, especially ones dripping with noir atmospherics, myself included, but it does put itself out as being only accessible to a select audience. That's why it failed at the box office; well that and the fact that this A list cast of some distinction meant expectations went through the roof prior to its release! But there's still much to enjoy as the seasoned performers dally around themes of mortality, loyalty and forbidden fruit, with the rose tinted cloud of nostalgia hovering constantly over head. It's apt that the film clearly harks back to noirish movies of yesterday, for its main characters are forced to constantly look backwards, to times passed, times never to be had again. The good far outweighs the bad here, but you need to be in a select band of film lovers to get the best rewards from it. 7/10

    I found this story of an aging private eye (Paul Newman in yet another terrific late-career performance), and his aging friends, lovers and clients (Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, all doing admirable work) touching, sweet, funny, sad, and an enjoyable noir mystery to boot. Its not that the plotting is that brilliant, or the story that novel, but this is really more about the characters than the mystery anyway. Its about aging and loss and trying to hold onto your pride and self-esteem in the face of the indignities later life. In all that it has much in common with Benton"s earlier, very good "Late Show", but for me this had even more depth and resonance (perhaps reflective of Benton"s own aging?).

On the front seat of this we have the team Paul Newman and director Robert Benton, re-teaming after the successful "Nobody's Fool"; and the amazing passengers of this are Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Giancarlo Esposito, Reese Witherspoon, Liev Schreiber, John Spencer, Margo Martindale and M. Emmet Walsh (horribly reduced to a pivotal role but with no speaking lines). Newman plays Harry, a veteran private detective in the twilight of his career and years, decadent and living of favors in the house of Jack Ames, a dying veteran actor (Hackman) and his wife (Sarandon), also an actress, doing some jobs here and there for them, covering up their dirt. Then, during one of those "jobs", after almost getting killed by another detective, he decides to check out what's behind the many out-coming mysteries which are appearing on his way, things that might have to do with his past and also things from the past of his bosses/friends. Favorable point for him: the unusual help of a sidekick (Esposito) - in terms of script kind of strange but it works well. Low point for him: flames getting higher between him and Ames wife; her brat daughter (Witherspoon) whose purpose is to put the man down just because she doesn't like him, due to an incident involving her boyfriend (Schreiber). Fine movie but quite cheap if you think about all the elements involved. Quite simplified as noir don't tend to be, convoluted in so many dialogs and never all that interesting or clever, "Twilight" begs for our attention but doesn't give much in return. When you see the mystery close of getting solved, already figuring out who's the bad guy, you end up asking yourself "Why should I care about this story?". Well, you should care but the movie doesn't impels you in such direction. You're there for the actors and that sometimes works replacing the excitement, the thrills, the action, everything that is missing here. While it feeds us with Newman giving an outstanding performance, it doesn't offer much when it comes to show the other actors, most of them reduced to a few scenes (Garner stands out with perfection though). Once again we see Newman's character trying to show he can hit the top of his craft even though he's not fast and younger as before, realizing that things have changed but he still can find a way to do something. But he played this several times before and in better projects ("The Verdict", "Nobody's Fool" and his Oscar winning Eddie Felson in "The Color of Money"). Sarandon brings lots of sensuality in her role but at times it seems director Benton and his writing partner Richard Russo are forcing things far too much when it comes to presenting those sexy moments. Hackman was a little underused in this, but presents some class act during his first scenes. Conclusion: it's not fun as it could and should be but it's watchable. Rare times a good team like this were gathered and could make something decent out of a movie. 7/10

    I like noir films in general but the pacing of certain scenes tends to be very slow and contrivances such as Sarandon's cigarette dialogue/fumbling exaggerates and amplifies the slowness; I suppose this pacing is intended to impart to the audience a feeling of importance/seriousness to the scene but it does just the opposite. I was surprised to read the budget for this film was $37 million because the production values don't seem to be that high --- apparently lots of money going to actors' salaries. Plot hole observation: Newman shoots and kills Garner in Garner's home; Newman apparently explains it away to the police as self defense because he was about to expose Garner as a murderer; the now dead Garner has no way to defend himself, and irregardless of this fact, the police swallow whole Newman's suspicious story (which, oops, happens to be the main premise of the screenplay) and let him go free. I know if I shot and killed someone in their house without clear motive I wouldn't be walking free anytime soon.

    Twilight is directed by Robert Benton who also co-writes the screenplay with Richard Russo. It stars Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Reese Witherspoon, Giancarlo Esposito and Liev Schreiber. Music is scored by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski. Harry Ross (Newman) is working for Jack (Hackman) and Catherine Ames (Sarandon). When one day he is sent to deliver a package for Jack, it turns out to be the starting point of trouble that opens up a 20 year old missing persons case involving Catherine's ex-husband. Twilight, the word in this case signifying persons in the twilight of their lives, is on the surface a standard murder mystery infused with noirish blood. But although the film never gets above a steady beat, where subtlety of performances and tone are key, it's a better picture than the poor box office it garnered suggests. However, in spite of the quality that comes with said performances and script, the latter sinewy and begging for the mature film fan's attention, picture is a little too subtle for its own good. When action does come into play it feels like an intrusion, misplaced even, which shouldn't be the case as there is, after all, a suspected murder and private investigation going on in the plot. The blend isn't quite right in spite of the intelligence and thought that's gone in to make the characters engaging. The whole calm over chaos approach taken by Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer) is however admirable, many people like dialogue driven movies, especially ones dripping with noir atmospherics, myself included, but it does put itself out as being only accessible to a select audience. That's why it failed at the box office; well that and the fact that this A list cast of some distinction meant expectations went through the roof prior to its release! But there's still much to enjoy as the seasoned performers dally around themes of mortality, loyalty and forbidden fruit, with the rose tinted cloud of nostalgia hovering constantly over head. It's apt that the film clearly harks back to noirish movies of yesterday, for its main characters are forced to constantly look backwards, to times passed, times never to be had again. The good far outweighs the bad here, but you need to be in a select band of film lovers to get the best rewards from it. 7/10

    I found this story of an aging private eye (Paul Newman in yet another terrific late-career performance), and his aging friends, lovers and clients (Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, all doing admirable work) touching, sweet, funny, sad, and an enjoyable noir mystery to boot. Its not that the plotting is that brilliant, or the story that novel, but this is really more about the characters than the mystery anyway. Its about aging and loss and trying to hold onto your pride and self-esteem in the face of the indignities later life. In all that it has much in common with Benton"s earlier, very good "Late Show", but for me this had even more depth and resonance (perhaps reflective of Benton"s own aging?).

    Paul Newman, director Robert Benton, and scriptwriter Richard Russo gets reassembled for this L.A. detective drama together with an talented stars headed by Susan Sarandon,Gene Hackman,James Garner,Stockard Channing and Reese Witherspoon in this thriller/noir film,Twilight. The story focuses on aging private detective Harry Ross,an ex-cop, is working on a case to return 17-year-old Mel Ames to her home. He tracks down Mel and her sleazy boyfriend,Jeff Willis, at a motel.Two years go by. Ross is living in southern California in the guest quarters of Mel's wealthy parents, Jack and Catherine Ames. One day, Jack asks a favor of Harryto deliver a package. It turns out to be the first development in a series of twists and turns in a 20- year-old case involving the disappearance of Catherine's ex-husband. A man named Ivar is murdered at the proposed meeting place where Harry was to bring the package. Harry is detained by police, including a close friend, Lt. Verna Hollander. At the police station, he runs into another old pal and colleague, now retired, Raymond Hope. Harry has a developing interest in Catherine and ends up in bed with her one night. He also is blackmailed by a parole officer called Mucho and by Mel's old boyfriend, Jeff, now an ex-con.A dying Jack Ames feels betrayed that Harry has had a fling with his wife. Harry, meanwhile, is forced to face the reality that his friends have been deceitful and manipulative of him.Raymond Hope tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all, but showdown ensues in Raymond's glass-walled hillside home. The movie has a great cast headed by Newman,Sarandon and Hackman.Unfortunately,the intelligent script isn't engaging enough to keep the viewer tuned in as the plot is lacking in energy and interest.The talent of the excellent cast is what made up for the movie and saved it from complete ruin.But nevertheless,the actors/actresses tried their best to make the most out of the screenplay and the final product turned out to be better than average.Overall,Twilight is a movie that has an excellent cast in a lifeless screenplay still deserves a 9 out of 10 rating.

He stumbles into a mysterious 20 year old case which deals with the disappearance of Sarandon's former husband. 'Twilight' has an excellent cast, on top of having Hackman, Sarandon, theirs an appearance from James Garner, who also has shady dealings. Liev Schrieber and Reese Whitherspoon also appear the latter contributes a revealing nude scene at the beginning.

    Reese Whitherspoon is topless in this movie and it is thoroughly gratuitous. Unlike most young actresses, however, at least Whitherspoon can look back and know she was exploited in a quality film while she was working with some of the best performers of a generation and one of the biggest movie stars of all time. Harry Ross (Paul Newman) used to be a cop and, after that, used to be a private investigator. But after a job down in Mexico bringing back the rebellious daughter of an aging movie star named Jack Ames (Gene Hackman), Harry gets shot. Ames takes Harry into his home while he recovers, then keeps him around as a handyman and family friend. Two years after the Mexico mess, the cancer-stricken Ames asks Harry to deliver an envelope for him. When he takes it to the instructed address, Harry nearly gets shot by a guy who was himself shot in the gut sometime before Harry arrived. Harry manages to just barely avoid getting killed until the guy dies, after which he discovers the man was named Lester Ivar (M. Emmet Walsh). I var was another former cop turned private eye and Harry learns that Ivar was continuing to investigate the disappearance of a actor 20 years ago. That actor was the then-husband of Jack Ames' current wife Catherine (Susan Sarandon). It seems the actor disappeared just in time to clear the way for Catherine to leave him for Jack. And if you think you know where the story is going based on that little plot twist, you're right. That is where the story goes. Harry's investigation into who killed Ivar, who's blackmailing Jack Ames and what happened to Catherine's first husband brings him into contact with another old private eye buddy (James Garner) and an old flame on the police force (Stockard Channing) before culminating in the sort of darkly hopeful ending that the best film noir always aspires to pull off. This is a very good movie. As I mentioned earlier, it's not much of a mystery. You might not be able to guess every single detail of the story before it unfolds, but you figure out early on how it's going to play out and even how it will likely end up. There's very little "whodunit" going on here, but that's not a problem. This isn't a movie about how a mystery gets solved. It's about the people caught up in it. The actors in Twilight are every bit as good as you could expect or want with performers of this caliber. Whitherspoon gives the weakest performance of the lot, but what young woman could measure up to the veteran talent in this cast? Newman, Sarandon, Hackman, Garner and Channing all do superb work as those rarest of all Hollywood movie characters  grown ups. These aren't old people tagging along in a young person's world and they aren't characters who behave a decade or two younger and stupider than they actually are. These are people with histories that define then and histories they sometimes struggle to overcome. Newman and Hackman are especially marvelous to watch as two men who both know the thread of their life is running thin and are readying themselves for that end. Even though you know where the story is going, it's a great pleasure to watch these characters get there. Twilight is quite a nice film with lots of real human emotion, humor and drama. It takes a very down-to-Earth approach to desperate acts and how they can shape people's lives, in contrast to many films where it seems like every aspect of existence is heightened and exaggerated to ridiculous levels. Newman made a handful of enjoyable and classy movies like Twilight at the end of his career and they serve as a worthy capstone to his remarkable achievements.

    The late actor Paul Newman portrays a fly in the ointment, the anti-hero version of Dick Tracy, herein Twilight. I've read some reviews of people wondering why widely acclaimed filmmaker Robert Benton has made this movie. A short answer: To provide screen experience to new starlets with veteran actors. There are 3 of those starlets in this film. First one is Reese Witherspoon. 1998 was an important milestone for her. She's been busy whole year long with Pleasantville and Overnight Delivery. Through 1998 summer she played in Twilight, thus she has bold scenes with Liev Schreiber. Even though she has a cameo role as Mel Ames in the film, her role includes the only nudity content of her box-office movies career. Yet, Twilight features its queen Susan Sarandon. For me, this is Sarandon's third best after Atlantic City and White Palace. She comes out of pool, starts walking in Eve outlook, looking for her Adam, then Newman comes by. The second starlet is Liev Schreiber. He plays Mel's date at Mexico. While Mel lies naked on a couch, she asks him "Do you love me?". He keeps his silence a bit while staring at her tits, and hinders himself from replying "No, I just love your tits". Thankfully Mel speaks before him: "I mean it doesn't really matter you love me or not". If all the movie critics thought the same way that Robert Benton has written the worst script of his life, they might be right. The third starlet is Patrick Malone. If you read this review right now, and don't know who Patrick Malone is, it's because herein Twilight he wasted his chance of a lifetime due to his imitation of Will Smith. A young actor in Hollywood must not copy other actors of same career level. I actually liked Malone's harmony with Newman playing his partner, if only he could have played his own style. He was one of the supporting actors in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon(1991). Even though the cast is rich on paper, the whole plot is turning around Paul Newman. No one is able to come closer to him, and he acts only with his self-belief. From my point of view, the main issue is not the script nor the cheapness of the story telling methods. Nobody but Benton and Newman, is in the mood of making a movie. Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing spoil the story. So many stars make it darker. Only Newman and Sarandon could have been enough to fill the cast, since the storyline is so simple.

    These excellent actors did what they could with the script which is what brings the rating down. I like film noir, Susan Sarandon, Paul Newman and Gene Hackman. Excellent supporting roles from Stockard Channing, James Garner, Reese Witherspoon (showing more than she does now) and Liev Shriber. POSSIBLE SPOILER: A aging private eye (Newman) has some dirty work to do for Hackman. In doing this, he uncovers a long held secret and not so nice things about Hackman and Sarandon. While not the most original of plots, watching these film legends is indeed a trip down memory lane of the Bogarts, Becalls et al. And how interesting was it that Stockard Channing and John Spencer (of West Wing fame) are teamed up here? Good solid film noir. Recommended despite dialog flaws.

    Newman, in a role similar to "Harper," is a has-been private detective living with and helping out aging movie actors Hackman and Sarandon. The script is rather convoluted and ultimately less than satisfying. However, it is a pleasure to watch old pros like Newman, Hackman, and Garner, each about seventy at the time of this film. Comparatively, Sarandon and Channing are spry young things in their fifties. The impressive cast also features up-and-coming stars like Witherspoon and Schreiber. Benton, who co-wrote the script, creates a nice atmosphere, aided by one of Bernstein's last scores. Given such an assemblage of talent, the film is a disappointment.

Unlike most young actresses, however, at least Whitherspoon can look back and know she was exploited in a quality film while she was working with some of the best performers of a generation and one of the biggest movie stars of all time. Harry Ross (Paul Newman) used to be a cop and, after that, used to be a private investigator. But after a job down in Mexico bringing back the rebellious daughter of an aging movie star named Jack Ames (Gene Hackman), Harry gets shot. Ames takes Harry into his home while he recovers, then keeps him around as a handyman and family friend. Two years after the Mexico mess, the cancer-stricken Ames asks Harry to deliver an envelope for him. When he takes it to the instructed address, Harry nearly gets shot by a guy who was himself shot in the gut sometime before Harry arrived. Harry manages to just barely avoid getting killed until the guy dies, after which he discovers the man was named Lester Ivar (M. Emmet Walsh). I var was another former cop turned private eye and Harry learns that Ivar was continuing to investigate the disappearance of a actor 20 years ago. That actor was the then-husband of Jack Ames' current wife Catherine (Susan Sarandon). It seems the actor disappeared just in time to clear the way for Catherine to leave him for Jack. And if you think you know where the story is going based on that little plot twist, you're right. That is where the story goes. Harry's investigation into who killed Ivar, who's blackmailing Jack Ames and what happened to Catherine's first husband brings him into contact with another old private eye buddy (James Garner) and an old flame on the police force (Stockard Channing) before culminating in the sort of darkly hopeful ending that the best film noir always aspires to pull off. This is a very good movie. As I mentioned earlier, it's not much of a mystery. You might not be able to guess every single detail of the story before it unfolds, but you figure out early on how it's going to play out and even how it will likely end up. There's very little "whodunit" going on here, but that's not a problem. This isn't a movie about how a mystery gets solved. It's about the people caught up in it. The actors in Twilight are every bit as good as you could expect or want with performers of this caliber. Whitherspoon gives the weakest performance of the lot, but what young woman could measure up to the veteran talent in this cast? Newman, Sarandon, Hackman, Garner and Channing all do superb work as those rarest of all Hollywood movie characters  grown ups. These aren't old people tagging along in a young person's world and they aren't characters who behave a decade or two younger and stupider than they actually are. These are people with histories that define then and histories they sometimes struggle to overcome. Newman and Hackman are especially marvelous to watch as two men who both know the thread of their life is running thin and are readying themselves for that end. Even though you know where the story is going, it's a great pleasure to watch these characters get there. Twilight is quite a nice film with lots of real human emotion, humor and drama. It takes a very down-to-Earth approach to desperate acts and how they can shape people's lives, in contrast to many films where it seems like every aspect of existence is heightened and exaggerated to ridiculous levels. Newman made a handful of enjoyable and classy movies like Twilight at the end of his career and they serve as a worthy capstone to his remarkable achievements.

    The late actor Paul Newman portrays a fly in the ointment, the anti-hero version of Dick Tracy, herein Twilight. I've read some reviews of people wondering why widely acclaimed filmmaker Robert Benton has made this movie. A short answer: To provide screen experience to new starlets with veteran actors. There are 3 of those starlets in this film. First one is Reese Witherspoon. 1998 was an important milestone for her. She's been busy whole year long with Pleasantville and Overnight Delivery. Through 1998 summer she played in Twilight, thus she has bold scenes with Liev Schreiber. Even though she has a cameo role as Mel Ames in the film, her role includes the only nudity content of her box-office movies career. Yet, Twilight features its queen Susan Sarandon. For me, this is Sarandon's third best after Atlantic City and White Palace. She comes out of pool, starts walking in Eve outlook, looking for her Adam, then Newman comes by. The second starlet is Liev Schreiber. He plays Mel's date at Mexico. While Mel lies naked on a couch, she asks him "Do you love me?". He keeps his silence a bit while staring at her tits, and hinders himself from replying "No, I just love your tits". Thankfully Mel speaks before him: "I mean it doesn't really matter you love me or not". If all the movie critics thought the same way that Robert Benton has written the worst script of his life, they might be right. The third starlet is Patrick Malone. If you read this review right now, and don't know who Patrick Malone is, it's because herein Twilight he wasted his chance of a lifetime due to his imitation of Will Smith. A young actor in Hollywood must not copy other actors of same career level. I actually liked Malone's harmony with Newman playing his partner, if only he could have played his own style. He was one of the supporting actors in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon(1991). Even though the cast is rich on paper, the whole plot is turning around Paul Newman. No one is able to come closer to him, and he acts only with his self-belief. From my point of view, the main issue is not the script nor the cheapness of the story telling methods. Nobody but Benton and Newman, is in the mood of making a movie. Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing spoil the story. So many stars make it darker. Only Newman and Sarandon could have been enough to fill the cast, since the storyline is so simple.

    These excellent actors did what they could with the script which is what brings the rating down. I like film noir, Susan Sarandon, Paul Newman and Gene Hackman. Excellent supporting roles from Stockard Channing, James Garner, Reese Witherspoon (showing more than she does now) and Liev Shriber. POSSIBLE SPOILER: A aging private eye (Newman) has some dirty work to do for Hackman. In doing this, he uncovers a long held secret and not so nice things about Hackman and Sarandon. While not the most original of plots, watching these film legends is indeed a trip down memory lane of the Bogarts, Becalls et al. And how interesting was it that Stockard Channing and John Spencer (of West Wing fame) are teamed up here? Good solid film noir. Recommended despite dialog flaws.

    Newman, in a role similar to "Harper," is a has-been private detective living with and helping out aging movie actors Hackman and Sarandon. The script is rather convoluted and ultimately less than satisfying. However, it is a pleasure to watch old pros like Newman, Hackman, and Garner, each about seventy at the time of this film. Comparatively, Sarandon and Channing are spry young things in their fifties. The impressive cast also features up-and-coming stars like Witherspoon and Schreiber. Benton, who co-wrote the script, creates a nice atmosphere, aided by one of Bernstein's last scores. Given such an assemblage of talent, the film is a disappointment.

    Heavyweight stars working on a weightless plot yet doing some good for us and themselves. That can be said of many movies and also about "Twilight". No, this isn't Team Edward or Team Jacob, it's a film noir about wrapped in secrets, ghosts from the past and some skeletons in the closet (more like on a swimming pool!). On the front seat of this we have the team Paul Newman and director Robert Benton, re-teaming after the successful "Nobody's Fool"; and the amazing passengers of this are Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Giancarlo Esposito, Reese Witherspoon, Liev Schreiber, John Spencer, Margo Martindale and M. Emmet Walsh (horribly reduced to a pivotal role but with no speaking lines). Newman plays Harry, a veteran private detective in the twilight of his career and years, decadent and living of favors in the house of Jack Ames, a dying veteran actor (Hackman) and his wife (Sarandon), also an actress, doing some jobs here and there for them, covering up their dirt. Then, during one of those "jobs", after almost getting killed by another detective, he decides to check out what's behind the many out-coming mysteries which are appearing on his way, things that might have to do with his past and also things from the past of his bosses/friends. Favorable point for him: the unusual help of a sidekick (Esposito) - in terms of script kind of strange but it works well. Low point for him: flames getting higher between him and Ames wife; her brat daughter (Witherspoon) whose purpose is to put the man down just because she doesn't like him, due to an incident involving her boyfriend (Schreiber). Fine movie but quite cheap if you think about all the elements involved. Quite simplified as noir don't tend to be, convoluted in so many dialogs and never all that interesting or clever, "Twilight" begs for our attention but doesn't give much in return. When you see the mystery close of getting solved, already figuring out who's the bad guy, you end up asking yourself "Why should I care about this story?". Well, you should care but the movie doesn't impels you in such direction. You're there for the actors and that sometimes works replacing the excitement, the thrills, the action, everything that is missing here. While it feeds us with Newman giving an outstanding performance, it doesn't offer much when it comes to show the other actors, most of them reduced to a few scenes (Garner stands out with perfection though). Once again we see Newman's character trying to show he can hit the top of his craft even though he's not fast and younger as before, realizing that things have changed but he still can find a way to do something. But he played this several times before and in better projects ("The Verdict", "Nobody's Fool" and his Oscar winning Eddie Felson in "The Color of Money"). Sarandon brings lots of sensuality in her role but at times it seems director Benton and his writing partner Richard Russo are forcing things far too much when it comes to presenting those sexy moments. Hackman was a little underused in this, but presents some class act during his first scenes. Conclusion: it's not fun as it could and should be but it's watchable. Rare times a good team like this were gathered and could make something decent out of a movie. 7/10

    I like noir films in general but the pacing of certain scenes tends to be very slow and contrivances such as Sarandon's cigarette dialogue/fumbling exaggerates and amplifies the slowness; I suppose this pacing is intended to impart to the audience a feeling of importance/seriousness to the scene but it does just the opposite. I was surprised to read the budget for this film was $37 million because the production values don't seem to be that high --- apparently lots of money going to actors' salaries. Plot hole observation: Newman shoots and kills Garner in Garner's home; Newman apparently explains it away to the police as self defense because he was about to expose Garner as a murderer; the now dead Garner has no way to defend himself, and irregardless of this fact, the police swallow whole Newman's suspicious story (which, oops, happens to be the main premise of the screenplay) and let him go free. I know if I shot and killed someone in their house without clear motive I wouldn't be walking free anytime soon.

    Twilight is directed by Robert Benton who also co-writes the screenplay with Richard Russo. It stars Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Reese Witherspoon, Giancarlo Esposito and Liev Schreiber. Music is scored by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski. Harry Ross (Newman) is working for Jack (Hackman) and Catherine Ames (Sarandon). When one day he is sent to deliver a package for Jack, it turns out to be the starting point of trouble that opens up a 20 year old missing persons case involving Catherine's ex-husband. Twilight, the word in this case signifying persons in the twilight of their lives, is on the surface a standard murder mystery infused with noirish blood. But although the film never gets above a steady beat, where subtlety of performances and tone are key, it's a better picture than the poor box office it garnered suggests. However, in spite of the quality that comes with said performances and script, the latter sinewy and begging for the mature film fan's attention, picture is a little too subtle for its own good. When action does come into play it feels like an intrusion, misplaced even, which shouldn't be the case as there is, after all, a suspected murder and private investigation going on in the plot. The blend isn't quite right in spite of the intelligence and thought that's gone in to make the characters engaging. The whole calm over chaos approach taken by Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer) is however admirable, many people like dialogue driven movies, especially ones dripping with noir atmospherics, myself included, but it does put itself out as being only accessible to a select audience. That's why it failed at the box office; well that and the fact that this A list cast of some distinction meant expectations went through the roof prior to its release! But there's still much to enjoy as the seasoned performers dally around themes of mortality, loyalty and forbidden fruit, with the rose tinted cloud of nostalgia hovering constantly over head. It's apt that the film clearly harks back to noirish movies of yesterday, for its main characters are forced to constantly look backwards, to times passed, times never to be had again. The good far outweighs the bad here, but you need to be in a select band of film lovers to get the best rewards from it. 7/10

    I found this story of an aging private eye (Paul Newman in yet another terrific late-career performance), and his aging friends, lovers and clients (Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, all doing admirable work) touching, sweet, funny, sad, and an enjoyable noir mystery to boot. Its not that the plotting is that brilliant, or the story that novel, but this is really more about the characters than the mystery anyway. Its about aging and loss and trying to hold onto your pride and self-esteem in the face of the indignities later life. In all that it has much in common with Benton"s earlier, very good "Late Show", but for me this had even more depth and resonance (perhaps reflective of Benton"s own aging?).

    Paul Newman, director Robert Benton, and scriptwriter Richard Russo gets reassembled for this L.A. detective drama together with an talented stars headed by Susan Sarandon,Gene Hackman,James Garner,Stockard Channing and Reese Witherspoon in this thriller/noir film,Twilight. The story focuses on aging private detective Harry Ross,an ex-cop, is working on a case to return 17-year-old Mel Ames to her home. He tracks down Mel and her sleazy boyfriend,Jeff Willis, at a motel.Two years go by. Ross is living in southern California in the guest quarters of Mel's wealthy parents, Jack and Catherine Ames. One day, Jack asks a favor of Harryto deliver a package. It turns out to be the first development in a series of twists and turns in a 20- year-old case involving the disappearance of Catherine's ex-husband. A man named Ivar is murdered at the proposed meeting place where Harry was to bring the package. Harry is detained by police, including a close friend, Lt. Verna Hollander. At the police station, he runs into another old pal and colleague, now retired, Raymond Hope. Harry has a developing interest in Catherine and ends up in bed with her one night. He also is blackmailed by a parole officer called Mucho and by Mel's old boyfriend, Jeff, now an ex-con.A dying Jack Ames feels betrayed that Harry has had a fling with his wife. Harry, meanwhile, is forced to face the reality that his friends have been deceitful and manipulative of him.Raymond Hope tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all, but showdown ensues in Raymond's glass-walled hillside home. The movie has a great cast headed by Newman,Sarandon and Hackman.Unfortunately,the intelligent script isn't engaging enough to keep the viewer tuned in as the plot is lacking in energy and interest.The talent of the excellent cast is what made up for the movie and saved it from complete ruin.But nevertheless,the actors/actresses tried their best to make the most out of the screenplay and the final product turned out to be better than average.Overall,Twilight is a movie that has an excellent cast in a lifeless screenplay still deserves a 9 out of 10 rating.

    Not the terrible 'Teen Vampire' nonsense but an excellently acted 'Noir' with Paul Newman as an over the hill retired ex-cop and former private eye who resides with a actor friend (Gene Hackman) who is dying from cancer and his seductive actress wife (Susan Sarandon) Newman is requested by Hackman to run an 'errand' unbeknown to him he becomes embroiled in murder. He stumbles into a mysterious 20 year old case which deals with the disappearance of Sarandon's former husband. 'Twilight' has an excellent cast, on top of having Hackman, Sarandon, theirs an appearance from James Garner, who also has shady dealings. Liev Schrieber and Reese Whitherspoon also appear the latter contributes a revealing nude scene at the beginning.

    I like noir films in general but the pacing of certain scenes tends to be very slow and contrivances such as Sarandon's cigarette dialogue/fumbling exaggerates and amplifies the slowness; I suppose this pacing is intended to impart to the audience a feeling of importance/seriousness to the scene but it does just the opposite. I was surprised to read the budget for this film was $37 million because the production values don't seem to be that high --- apparently lots of money going to actors' salaries. Plot hole observation: Newman shoots and kills Garner in Garner's home; Newman apparently explains it away to the police as self defense because he was about to expose Garner as a murderer; the now dead Garner has no way to defend himself, and irregardless of this fact, the police swallow whole Newman's suspicious story (which, oops, happens to be the main premise of the screenplay) and let him go free. I know if I shot and killed someone in their house without clear motive I wouldn't be walking free anytime soon.

    Twilight is directed by Robert Benton who also co-writes the screenplay with Richard Russo. It stars Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Reese Witherspoon, Giancarlo Esposito and Liev Schreiber. Music is scored by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski. Harry Ross (Newman) is working for Jack (Hackman) and Catherine Ames (Sarandon). When one day he is sent to deliver a package for Jack, it turns out to be the starting point of trouble that opens up a 20 year old missing persons case involving Catherine's ex-husband. Twilight, the word in this case signifying persons in the twilight of their lives, is on the surface a standard murder mystery infused with noirish blood. But although the film never gets above a steady beat, where subtlety of performances and tone are key, it's a better picture than the poor box office it garnered suggests. However, in spite of the quality that comes with said performances and script, the latter sinewy and begging for the mature film fan's attention, picture is a little too subtle for its own good. When action does come into play it feels like an intrusion, misplaced even, which shouldn't be the case as there is, after all, a suspected murder and private investigation going on in the plot. The blend isn't quite right in spite of the intelligence and thought that's gone in to make the characters engaging. The whole calm over chaos approach taken by Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer) is however admirable, many people like dialogue driven movies, especially ones dripping with noir atmospherics, myself included, but it does put itself out as being only accessible to a select audience. That's why it failed at the box office; well that and the fact that this A list cast of some distinction meant expectations went through the roof prior to its release! But there's still much to enjoy as the seasoned performers dally around themes of mortality, loyalty and forbidden fruit, with the rose tinted cloud of nostalgia hovering constantly over head. It's apt that the film clearly harks back to noirish movies of yesterday, for its main characters are forced to constantly look backwards, to times passed, times never to be had again. The good far outweighs the bad here, but you need to be in a select band of film lovers to get the best rewards from it. 7/10

    I found this story of an aging private eye (Paul Newman in yet another terrific late-career performance), and his aging friends, lovers and clients (Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, all doing admirable work) touching, sweet, funny, sad, and an enjoyable noir mystery to boot. Its not that the plotting is that brilliant, or the story that novel, but this is really more about the characters than the mystery anyway. Its about aging and loss and trying to hold onto your pride and self-esteem in the face of the indignities later life. In all that it has much in common with Benton"s earlier, very good "Late Show", but for me this had even more depth and resonance (perhaps reflective of Benton"s own aging?).

    Paul Newman, director Robert Benton, and scriptwriter Richard Russo gets reassembled for this L.A. detective drama together with an talented stars headed by Susan Sarandon,Gene Hackman,James Garner,Stockard Channing and Reese Witherspoon in this thriller/noir film,Twilight. The story focuses on aging private detective Harry Ross,an ex-cop, is working on a case to return 17-year-old Mel Ames to her home. He tracks down Mel and her sleazy boyfriend,Jeff Willis, at a motel.Two years go by. Ross is living in southern California in the guest quarters of Mel's wealthy parents, Jack and Catherine Ames. One day, Jack asks a favor of Harryto deliver a package. It turns out to be the first development in a series of twists and turns in a 20- year-old case involving the disappearance of Catherine's ex-husband. A man named Ivar is murdered at the proposed meeting place where Harry was to bring the package. Harry is detained by police, including a close friend, Lt. Verna Hollander. At the police station, he runs into another old pal and colleague, now retired, Raymond Hope. Harry has a developing interest in Catherine and ends up in bed with her one night. He also is blackmailed by a parole officer called Mucho and by Mel's old boyfriend, Jeff, now an ex-con.A dying Jack Ames feels betrayed that Harry has had a fling with his wife. Harry, meanwhile, is forced to face the reality that his friends have been deceitful and manipulative of him.Raymond Hope tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all, but showdown ensues in Raymond's glass-walled hillside home. The movie has a great cast headed by Newman,Sarandon and Hackman.Unfortunately,the intelligent script isn't engaging enough to keep the viewer tuned in as the plot is lacking in energy and interest.The talent of the excellent cast is what made up for the movie and saved it from complete ruin.But nevertheless,the actors/actresses tried their best to make the most out of the screenplay and the final product turned out to be better than average.Overall,Twilight is a movie that has an excellent cast in a lifeless screenplay still deserves a 9 out of 10 rating.

    Reese Whitherspoon is topless in this movie and it is thoroughly gratuitous. Unlike most young actresses, however, at least Whitherspoon can look back and know she was exploited in a quality film while she was working with some of the best performers of a generation and one of the biggest movie stars of all time. Harry Ross (Paul Newman) used to be a cop and, after that, used to be a private investigator. But after a job down in Mexico bringing back the rebellious daughter of an aging movie star named Jack Ames (Gene Hackman), Harry gets shot. Ames takes Harry into his home while he recovers, then keeps him around as a handyman and family friend. Two years after the Mexico mess, the cancer-stricken Ames asks Harry to deliver an envelope for him. When he takes it to the instructed address, Harry nearly gets shot by a guy who was himself shot in the gut sometime before Harry arrived. Harry manages to just barely avoid getting killed until the guy dies, after which he discovers the man was named Lester Ivar (M. Emmet Walsh). I var was another former cop turned private eye and Harry learns that Ivar was continuing to investigate the disappearance of a actor 20 years ago. That actor was the then-husband of Jack Ames' current wife Catherine (Susan Sarandon). It seems the actor disappeared just in time to clear the way for Catherine to leave him for Jack. And if you think you know where the story is going based on that little plot twist, you're right. That is where the story goes. Harry's investigation into who killed Ivar, who's blackmailing Jack Ames and what happened to Catherine's first husband brings him into contact with another old private eye buddy (James Garner) and an old flame on the police force (Stockard Channing) before culminating in the sort of darkly hopeful ending that the best film noir always aspires to pull off. This is a very good movie. As I mentioned earlier, it's not much of a mystery. You might not be able to guess every single detail of the story before it unfolds, but you figure out early on how it's going to play out and even how it will likely end up. There's very little "whodunit" going on here, but that's not a problem. This isn't a movie about how a mystery gets solved. It's about the people caught up in it. The actors in Twilight are every bit as good as you could expect or want with performers of this caliber. Whitherspoon gives the weakest performance of the lot, but what young woman could measure up to the veteran talent in this cast? Newman, Sarandon, Hackman, Garner and Channing all do superb work as those rarest of all Hollywood movie characters  grown ups. These aren't old people tagging along in a young person's world and they aren't characters who behave a decade or two younger and stupider than they actually are. These are people with histories that define then and histories they sometimes struggle to overcome. Newman and Hackman are especially marvelous to watch as two men who both know the thread of their life is running thin and are readying themselves for that end. Even though you know where the story is going, it's a great pleasure to watch these characters get there. Twilight is quite a nice film with lots of real human emotion, humor and drama. It takes a very down-to-Earth approach to desperate acts and how they can shape people's lives, in contrast to many films where it seems like every aspect of existence is heightened and exaggerated to ridiculous levels. Newman made a handful of enjoyable and classy movies like Twilight at the end of his career and they serve as a worthy capstone to his remarkable achievements.

    The late actor Paul Newman portrays a fly in the ointment, the anti-hero version of Dick Tracy, herein Twilight. I've read some reviews of people wondering why widely acclaimed filmmaker Robert Benton has made this movie. A short answer: To provide screen experience to new starlets with veteran actors. There are 3 of those starlets in this film. First one is Reese Witherspoon. 1998 was an important milestone for her. She's been busy whole year long with Pleasantville and Overnight Delivery. Through 1998 summer she played in Twilight, thus she has bold scenes with Liev Schreiber. Even though she has a cameo role as Mel Ames in the film, her role includes the only nudity content of her box-office movies career. Yet, Twilight features its queen Susan Sarandon. For me, this is Sarandon's third best after Atlantic City and White Palace. She comes out of pool, starts walking in Eve outlook, looking for her Adam, then Newman comes by. The second starlet is Liev Schreiber. He plays Mel's date at Mexico. While Mel lies naked on a couch, she asks him "Do you love me?". He keeps his silence a bit while staring at her tits, and hinders himself from replying "No, I just love your tits". Thankfully Mel speaks before him: "I mean it doesn't really matter you love me or not". If all the movie critics thought the same way that Robert Benton has written the worst script of his life, they might be right. The third starlet is Patrick Malone. If you read this review right now, and don't know who Patrick Malone is, it's because herein Twilight he wasted his chance of a lifetime due to his imitation of Will Smith. A young actor in Hollywood must not copy other actors of same career level. I actually liked Malone's harmony with Newman playing his partner, if only he could have played his own style. He was one of the supporting actors in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon(1991). Even though the cast is rich on paper, the whole plot is turning around Paul Newman. No one is able to come closer to him, and he acts only with his self-belief. From my point of view, the main issue is not the script nor the cheapness of the story telling methods. Nobody but Benton and Newman, is in the mood of making a movie. Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing spoil the story. So many stars make it darker. Only Newman and Sarandon could have been enough to fill the cast, since the storyline is so simple.

    These excellent actors did what they could with the script which is what brings the rating down. I like film noir, Susan Sarandon, Paul Newman and Gene Hackman. Excellent supporting roles from Stockard Channing, James Garner, Reese Witherspoon (showing more than she does now) and Liev Shriber. POSSIBLE SPOILER: A aging private eye (Newman) has some dirty work to do for Hackman. In doing this, he uncovers a long held secret and not so nice things about Hackman and Sarandon. While not the most original of plots, watching these film legends is indeed a trip down memory lane of the Bogarts, Becalls et al. And how interesting was it that Stockard Channing and John Spencer (of West Wing fame) are teamed up here? Good solid film noir. Recommended despite dialog flaws.

    Newman, in a role similar to "Harper," is a has-been private detective living with and helping out aging movie actors Hackman and Sarandon. The script is rather convoluted and ultimately less than satisfying. However, it is a pleasure to watch old pros like Newman, Hackman, and Garner, each about seventy at the time of this film. Comparatively, Sarandon and Channing are spry young things in their fifties. The impressive cast also features up-and-coming stars like Witherspoon and Schreiber. Benton, who co-wrote the script, creates a nice atmosphere, aided by one of Bernstein's last scores. Given such an assemblage of talent, the film is a disappointment.

    Heavyweight stars working on a weightless plot yet doing some good for us and themselves. That can be said of many movies and also about "Twilight". No, this isn't Team Edward or Team Jacob, it's a film noir about wrapped in secrets, ghosts from the past and some skeletons in the closet (more like on a swimming pool!). On the front seat of this we have the team Paul Newman and director Robert Benton, re-teaming after the successful "Nobody's Fool"; and the amazing passengers of this are Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Giancarlo Esposito, Reese Witherspoon, Liev Schreiber, John Spencer, Margo Martindale and M. Emmet Walsh (horribly reduced to a pivotal role but with no speaking lines). Newman plays Harry, a veteran private detective in the twilight of his career and years, decadent and living of favors in the house of Jack Ames, a dying veteran actor (Hackman) and his wife (Sarandon), also an actress, doing some jobs here and there for them, covering up their dirt. Then, during one of those "jobs", after almost getting killed by another detective, he decides to check out what's behind the many out-coming mysteries which are appearing on his way, things that might have to do with his past and also things from the past of his bosses/friends. Favorable point for him: the unusual help of a sidekick (Esposito) - in terms of script kind of strange but it works well. Low point for him: flames getting higher between him and Ames wife; her brat daughter (Witherspoon) whose purpose is to put the man down just because she doesn't like him, due to an incident involving her boyfriend (Schreiber). Fine movie but quite cheap if you think about all the elements involved. Quite simplified as noir don't tend to be, convoluted in so many dialogs and never all that interesting or clever, "Twilight" begs for our attention but doesn't give much in return. When you see the mystery close of getting solved, already figuring out who's the bad guy, you end up asking yourself "Why should I care about this story?". Well, you should care but the movie doesn't impels you in such direction. You're there for the actors and that sometimes works replacing the excitement, the thrills, the action, everything that is missing here. While it feeds us with Newman giving an outstanding performance, it doesn't offer much when it comes to show the other actors, most of them reduced to a few scenes (Garner stands out with perfection though). Once again we see Newman's character trying to show he can hit the top of his craft even though he's not fast and younger as before, realizing that things have changed but he still can find a way to do something. But he played this several times before and in better projects ("The Verdict", "Nobody's Fool" and his Oscar winning Eddie Felson in "The Color of Money"). Sarandon brings lots of sensuality in her role but at times it seems director Benton and his writing partner Richard Russo are forcing things far too much when it comes to presenting those sexy moments. Hackman was a little underused in this, but presents some class act during his first scenes. Conclusion: it's not fun as it could and should be but it's watchable. Rare times a good team like this were gathered and could make something decent out of a movie. 7/10

    The late actor Paul Newman portrays a fly in the ointment, the anti-hero version of Dick Tracy, herein Twilight. I've read some reviews of people wondering why widely acclaimed filmmaker Robert Benton has made this movie. A short answer: To provide screen experience to new starlets with veteran actors. There are 3 of those starlets in this film. First one is Reese Witherspoon. 1998 was an important milestone for her. She's been busy whole year long with Pleasantville and Overnight Delivery. Through 1998 summer she played in Twilight, thus she has bold scenes with Liev Schreiber. Even though she has a cameo role as Mel Ames in the film, her role includes the only nudity content of her box-office movies career. Yet, Twilight features its queen Susan Sarandon. For me, this is Sarandon's third best after Atlantic City and White Palace. She comes out of pool, starts walking in Eve outlook, looking for her Adam, then Newman comes by. The second starlet is Liev Schreiber. He plays Mel's date at Mexico. While Mel lies naked on a couch, she asks him "Do you love me?". He keeps his silence a bit while staring at her tits, and hinders himself from replying "No, I just love your tits". Thankfully Mel speaks before him: "I mean it doesn't really matter you love me or not". If all the movie critics thought the same way that Robert Benton has written the worst script of his life, they might be right. The third starlet is Patrick Malone. If you read this review right now, and don't know who Patrick Malone is, it's because herein Twilight he wasted his chance of a lifetime due to his imitation of Will Smith. A young actor in Hollywood must not copy other actors of same career level. I actually liked Malone's harmony with Newman playing his partner, if only he could have played his own style. He was one of the supporting actors in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon(1991). Even though the cast is rich on paper, the whole plot is turning around Paul Newman. No one is able to come closer to him, and he acts only with his self-belief. From my point of view, the main issue is not the script nor the cheapness of the story telling methods. Nobody but Benton and Newman, is in the mood of making a movie. Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing spoil the story. So many stars make it darker. Only Newman and Sarandon could have been enough to fill the cast, since the storyline is so simple.

    These excellent actors did what they could with the script which is what brings the rating down. I like film noir, Susan Sarandon, Paul Newman and Gene Hackman. Excellent supporting roles from Stockard Channing, James Garner, Reese Witherspoon (showing more than she does now) and Liev Shriber. POSSIBLE SPOILER: A aging private eye (Newman) has some dirty work to do for Hackman. In doing this, he uncovers a long held secret and not so nice things about Hackman and Sarandon. While not the most original of plots, watching these film legends is indeed a trip down memory lane of the Bogarts, Becalls et al. And how interesting was it that Stockard Channing and John Spencer (of West Wing fame) are teamed up here? Good solid film noir. Recommended despite dialog flaws.

    Newman, in a role similar to "Harper," is a has-been private detective living with and helping out aging movie actors Hackman and Sarandon. The script is rather convoluted and ultimately less than satisfying. However, it is a pleasure to watch old pros like Newman, Hackman, and Garner, each about seventy at the time of this film. Comparatively, Sarandon and Channing are spry young things in their fifties. The impressive cast also features up-and-coming stars like Witherspoon and Schreiber. Benton, who co-wrote the script, creates a nice atmosphere, aided by one of Bernstein's last scores. Given such an assemblage of talent, the film is a disappointment.
