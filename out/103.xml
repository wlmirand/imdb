    I seem to be one of the few people saying this, but: "All Dogs Go to Heaven 2" is actually a MAJOR step up from Bluth's 1989 original! Charlie Barkin and Itchy Itchiford are reunited in Heaven, after the latter chokes to death on a chicken bone. Charlie is bored of life in Heaven, but soon the heavenly hounds find out that Gabriel's horn has been stolen and is now in the heart of San Francisco. Charlie and Itchy must rival their old enemy Carface (who stole the horn in the first place), thwart Carface's new boss, Red the Cat Demon, and help a little boy, named David, find his way home. This is a great sequel! Great music, great characters, and a story MUCH easier to follow than its predecessor...8/10 stars! Highly recommended!!! :)

    When the Don Bluth animated classic, "All Dogs Go To Heaven", was released, it did an okay job at the box-office and became a classic. There has been some sequel's to Don Bluth's movies and most of them were terrible (Secret Of Nimh 2 for Example). But in 1996, MGM studios released a sequel to the original called, "All Dogs Go To Heaven 2". It did a bad job at the Box-Office and got a lot of negative review's from critics and fans of the original. But for me, I thought it was a decent sequel. The movie had some good animation even though it wasn't as good as the first one, it had some nice voice acting from Charlie Sheen, Sheena Easton, and it had Dom DeLuise returning as his character from the first one. The song's were also not that bad, even though I didn't care for, "Count Me Out" and "On Easy Street". Beside's the fact that I didn't like the song's, "Count Me Out" and "On Easy Street", I also thought the villain, Red, was weak and the story wasn't that good. The story was okay, but I wish it had Charlie and Itchy seeing Anne-Marie again. "All Dogs Go To Heaven", is not a bad sequel but it's not as great as the original. If you're a fan of the original, then this film is not for you. If you're someone looking for a good animated film for your kids to watch, I recommend renting the original and this one.

    If you just watched All Dogs Go To Heaven, and learn that there's a sequel, don't watch it. It's horrible. It's absolutely awful. They rush the characters to develop. Sasha, for example, begins singing about how you can count her out for love. And at the end, this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy-adventure film. They rip Charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy, soft, but still rebellious version of himself. The humor behind Carface's character is just completely lost. He's a totally different dog. He doesn't have a cool voice anymore, he isn't that villain you love to hate anymore, he's just a wimp voiced by none other than Mermaid Man from Spongebob. Speaking of voice actors.. Charlie has a completely different voice. And while it isn't horrible, I don't like it. It's terrible in comparison to the excellent job that Burt Reynolds did for the character in the first film. Dom DeLuise is wonderful as always, as Itchy. That character stays true, and that's why this film gets a 3/10. Purely because Dom DeLuise was still voicing Itchy. Oh, and my last complaint. I know Ann-Marie's movie was done and gone, she has parents now, etc, but did Charlie completely forget about her, or what? No mention at ALL of her in the second film. I mean, even a small mention from Itchy would have been acceptable. (ex. "Charlie, we have to get back. You can't take care of every kid that needs rescuing.) Or something of the sort. I mean, he died living with her, she deserves some kind of mention. Don't watch this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.

    I do like the original, despite one or two flaws. I did feel it was a little too dark for children, but it was beautifully animated and moving. This sequel is definitely inferior in comparison, but there were a few redeeming merits. The animation is not very good, there were a number of colour changes and very flat backgrounds, and I felt that the animation on Red was a bit too frightening for children. The songs were very pleasant, especially I will always be with you, but not memorable. Then again, neither were most of the songs in the original. I did like the singing voice of Charlie, provided by Jesse Conti, not so much Charlie Sheen speaking-it just wasn't Charlie. Also Sheena Easton was lovely as Sasha; if you want to know a little more about her, she sang "A Dream Worth Keeping"(FernGully) and "Now and Forever" with Barry Manilow.(Pebble and the Penguin, which I like more than this to be honest)I loved Mark Watters' incidental music too. I liked the character David, but I found Anne Marie a lot more likable, I cannot watch the end of the first film without getting teary-eyed. Likewise with Carface, Vic Tayback was definitely better, but Ernest Borgnine did a very good job with the voicing I felt, but Carface lacked the calculating manipulation that made him so memorable in the original. Bebe Neuwirth's Annabelle did little for me too, I preferred Melba Moore's angelic interpretation. Now another flaw, and the main flaw, was the story. It was a good idea, with some neat subplots, but it was told way too fast. The studio should have focused on accuracy and detail rather than piling on rushed subplot and another. Now for the main villain Red, a bit too frightening for my liking, but I liked his song, with the Spanish flamenco like rhythms. George Hearn did more than adequately with the voicing,very menacing at times like in his song, but I felt he was out of character. I wouldn't initially associate Hearn with villainous roles. A more inspired choice would have been Tim Curry, as long as they didn't make him do a phony accent that they tend to burden him with. The script wasn't bad, but it did need a lot more work, whereas Borgnine and Dom DeLuise provided the laughs, Sheen and Easton were a little less convincing. In conclusion, a disappointing sequel to one of the more memorable Don Bluth movies, but it is not as bad as the Secret of NIMH sequel, which was so awful I didn't know what to say. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    I'm going to do something i don't do very often. i'm going to gush for a moment. i LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. This is one of my favorite animated movies ever and it puts the first one to shame. OK. gushing over. point is, i love this film. This is much better than the first for several reasons. 1. it's not nearly as dark. i had a problem with that. the first one kinda scared me. it was creepy, i didn't like the girl, and the puppies thing was weird. 2. the animation is so much smoother. the first looked gritty and gross looking, but this one has incredibly smooth lines that flow easily and that gains major points in my book. 3. the characters are much friendlier. i LOVE annabelle's new look and i think sasha, while i usually don't like the random addition of a love interest, pulled it off well. and David is a HELL of a lot less annoying then the chick from the first. 4. the music. holy crap is the music good in this movie. i've had these songs stuck in my head for 10 years. and that's just fine with me. I could keep making a list, but i feel you get the point. This movie is golden. if you want something to show to your kids, or you just feel like watching a good movie, pop this one in. you won't be disappointed. if i had to make one nitpick it would be that the villain was a bit lame. but that only makes it slight imperfection. If more animated movies were like this, i would have no reason to watch live action at ALL. So let's break the story down. Charlie doesn't want to be in heaven anymore. itchy dies and joins charlie. they both get sent down to earth after carface steals the horn of gabriel. they get some weird collars from an evil looking dog that carface introduces them too (they don't know he took it yet) and charlie meets sasha singing onstage (probably the only bad song of the movie) he then follows her back to find David a boy who ran away from home because his stepmom is preggers. he meets up with charlie, who since he's from heaven he can talk, uses their one miracle to let sasha talk too. and after convincing David he's a guardian angel, they're off to retrieve the horn. after a crazy scene at a police station, they do, and they go to make David money as a street magician. David sees how hard it is and wants to go home. but uh oh, charlie's collar wears out just after he finds love with sasha and goes back to get new ones. the dog gives it to him in exchange for the horn who turns into a demon cat. Carface kidnaps David for the horn and charlie goes to go rescue him. After a cool boss fight scene, Charlie wins, everyone is reunited, carface is sucked down to hell (don't worry, he's OK in the TV series) and anabelle lets charlie come back to life while itchy stays in heaven and they live happily ever after. that is unless you count the awesome TV series where itchy comes down to earth to help Charlie do good angel deeds. but that's a different story. This movie is just great. do yourself a favor if you're feeling down. Watch this movie. you DON'T have to watch the first. just stick with this one and it'll brighten up your day. guaranteed. This movie found its way to easy street. with a 9. out of 10.

    My Take: Harmless yet childishly corny. Calling it a family movie is an overstatement. This sequel to Don Bluth's anti-Disney fable ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is appealing but weak. The animation, when compared to it's admittedly better predecessors are colorful but falls short of the product they've come to expect. Combined with weak musical numbers (even with Sheena Easton lending her vocals) and even weaker characters and a lack of a better story results in a lively but completely forgettable fluff. A popular cats-list of voice actors including Charlie Sheen, Ernest Borgnine, Sheena Easton, Dom DeLuise and Bebe Neuwirth team up to provide a rather appealing star power to this weakling of an animated adventure. After the legendary Gabriel's Horn, which unlocks the doors to Heaven's Gate, is stolen, Charlie Barkin (voiced by Sheen) and his buddy Ithcy (voiced by DeLuise) go back to earth to retrieve it, where they also follow old "buddy" Carface (voiced by Borgnine), who happens to work for the evil cat wizard named Reginald (voiced by Tony Jay), who wants the Horn for himself. Two sub-plots are provided, but either one doesn't really help much at all. One includes a romance that goes on between Charlie and an Irish Setter singer (voiced by Easton), and the other, concerns the dogs helping a little runaway boy named David. The story is fairly weak, even considering the standards of weak non-Disney effort. Bluth will most likely find his way as a Disney successor, but he has hardly succeeds here. Even if he has a way of entertaining kids, Bluth has yet to discover the trappings to appeal adults. The result is a film that will appealing to the kids. Adults should stick to something else. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.

    Going through these posts I see that many have made mistakes when it comes to the movie --- though these mistakes are understandable. You have to pay real attention to the movie. I love this movie and I've always loved it more then the Original (I know this is VERY rare) Let me tell you my reasons why. 1. The songs are much better this time around. I love them all dearly. The ONLY song that I liked (and I barley like it) is the song that Charlie and Annabelle sing when Charlie first gets into heaven. All the other songs are dull. 2. The plot. The plot in the first movie was mostly about revenge...it wasn't nearly has good as the 2nd movie. It was nice to have Charlie fall in love with someone and end up being alive. 3. Many think that this movie makes it seem Heaven is 'boring' which isn't true. The first Heaven was dull...there seemed to be nothing, but clouds and a area filled with clocks. In this movie you can do whatever you want anytime you want. I think Charlie doesn't like heaven, because he feels as if he is missing something(I think when he dies later on he'll be happier in heaven because at least he figured out what he was missing..which was love) 4. The cat is NOT the devil. How do I know this? At the end of the movie when Carface comes out from where he was hiding he asks where Red was. Charlie then says his BOSS wanted him back (Or something like that) If Red was the Devil...he wouldn't HAVE a boss. Nor would he get sucked back into hell (He was getting sucked up BEFORE Charlie blew the horn...so it wasn't because of that) Overall it was a beautiful animated film that I adored. There really isn't anything that I don't like. Don't get me wrong I love All Dogs Go To Heaven, but the 2nd one will ALWAYS be my favorite.

    Did any remember the old characters from the original movie, "All Dogs Go To Heaven"? Now, I've heard it. They're have returned in the sequel. I was expected whom known those characters...(clears throat)....characters that do not appear in this sequel are Killer, Anne Marie, Flo and the other puppies. Killer, as we said again, later appeared in the TV series and the Christmas special. And I was on the hunt. The plot: Charlie and Itchy end up in San Francisco, then new friends....never mind. I'm not going to have it on my comic strip, Kody The Fox! Well, otherwise, I watched it at Judy's and she has the movie, I'd wish I would have the movie at my dad's, or would I rent it? The heroic fox has signed off to ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN 2.

    My cousin and I watched the All Dogs Go To Heaven films yesterday and we both liked them. But he's 6 years old and looks at this film as Oscar material, to be honest I wasn't expecting much since I was very satisfied with the way the first one ended. While I agree that this was not any where near up to par as the first one I still thought that this was a cute movie. As far as sequels go, you have to admit that All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 is better than most. The voices were actually closer than usual and the story was still pretty charming. Even though the first one seemed to have an official conclusion, this was just a new introduction for those little one's who might have missed All Dogs Go To Heaven. Charley has a new friend in Heaven, Itchy is there to join him. But Charley is getting a bit bored with the whole purity and typical days of being there. Carface has won an award for being the most turned around angel and it seems like things are working out for him, only he's really after a horn to give to Satan, or at least the Satan of dogs. But when Carface drops the horn, it goes down to Earth, Charley and Itchy are sent to get it, but Charley is quickly distracted by a beautiful dog, Shasha, who is taking care of a homeless boy, David. Since Charley is an angel, they can't see him, until he finds out that Carface, who is also down on Earth, has a special collar that will make him and Itchy visible, but Charley should watch who gives him that collar, he might be expecting something more in return. All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 is over all a cute movie. Even though that it was silly and not needed, for the kids it worked very well. The animation is pretty much like the same, but the new characters are very sweet and lovable. It's just a sweet little family film and I feel the rating is a little bit harsh, but I understand for the fans of the original. Like I said, it destroys the point of the first one, but I'm not going to spoil that for you. But I would recommend for you to give this a shot, but it's OK to just stick with the first film, that ended the story just fine. 6/10

I liked the character David, but I found Anne Marie a lot more likable, I cannot watch the end of the first film without getting teary-eyed. Likewise with Carface, Vic Tayback was definitely better, but Ernest Borgnine did a very good job with the voicing I felt, but Carface lacked the calculating manipulation that made him so memorable in the original. Bebe Neuwirth's Annabelle did little for me too, I preferred Melba Moore's angelic interpretation. Now another flaw, and the main flaw, was the story. It was a good idea, with some neat subplots, but it was told way too fast. The studio should have focused on accuracy and detail rather than piling on rushed subplot and another. Now for the main villain Red, a bit too frightening for my liking, but I liked his song, with the Spanish flamenco like rhythms. George Hearn did more than adequately with the voicing,very menacing at times like in his song, but I felt he was out of character. I wouldn't initially associate Hearn with villainous roles. A more inspired choice would have been Tim Curry, as long as they didn't make him do a phony accent that they tend to burden him with. The script wasn't bad, but it did need a lot more work, whereas Borgnine and Dom DeLuise provided the laughs, Sheen and Easton were a little less convincing. In conclusion, a disappointing sequel to one of the more memorable Don Bluth movies, but it is not as bad as the Secret of NIMH sequel, which was so awful I didn't know what to say. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    I'm going to do something i don't do very often. i'm going to gush for a moment. i LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. This is one of my favorite animated movies ever and it puts the first one to shame. OK. gushing over. point is, i love this film. This is much better than the first for several reasons. 1. it's not nearly as dark. i had a problem with that. the first one kinda scared me. it was creepy, i didn't like the girl, and the puppies thing was weird. 2. the animation is so much smoother. the first looked gritty and gross looking, but this one has incredibly smooth lines that flow easily and that gains major points in my book. 3. the characters are much friendlier. i LOVE annabelle's new look and i think sasha, while i usually don't like the random addition of a love interest, pulled it off well. and David is a HELL of a lot less annoying then the chick from the first. 4. the music. holy crap is the music good in this movie. i've had these songs stuck in my head for 10 years. and that's just fine with me. I could keep making a list, but i feel you get the point. This movie is golden. if you want something to show to your kids, or you just feel like watching a good movie, pop this one in. you won't be disappointed. if i had to make one nitpick it would be that the villain was a bit lame. but that only makes it slight imperfection. If more animated movies were like this, i would have no reason to watch live action at ALL. So let's break the story down. Charlie doesn't want to be in heaven anymore. itchy dies and joins charlie. they both get sent down to earth after carface steals the horn of gabriel. they get some weird collars from an evil looking dog that carface introduces them too (they don't know he took it yet) and charlie meets sasha singing onstage (probably the only bad song of the movie) he then follows her back to find David a boy who ran away from home because his stepmom is preggers. he meets up with charlie, who since he's from heaven he can talk, uses their one miracle to let sasha talk too. and after convincing David he's a guardian angel, they're off to retrieve the horn. after a crazy scene at a police station, they do, and they go to make David money as a street magician. David sees how hard it is and wants to go home. but uh oh, charlie's collar wears out just after he finds love with sasha and goes back to get new ones. the dog gives it to him in exchange for the horn who turns into a demon cat. Carface kidnaps David for the horn and charlie goes to go rescue him. After a cool boss fight scene, Charlie wins, everyone is reunited, carface is sucked down to hell (don't worry, he's OK in the TV series) and anabelle lets charlie come back to life while itchy stays in heaven and they live happily ever after. that is unless you count the awesome TV series where itchy comes down to earth to help Charlie do good angel deeds. but that's a different story. This movie is just great. do yourself a favor if you're feeling down. Watch this movie. you DON'T have to watch the first. just stick with this one and it'll brighten up your day. guaranteed. This movie found its way to easy street. with a 9. out of 10.

    My Take: Harmless yet childishly corny. Calling it a family movie is an overstatement. This sequel to Don Bluth's anti-Disney fable ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is appealing but weak. The animation, when compared to it's admittedly better predecessors are colorful but falls short of the product they've come to expect. Combined with weak musical numbers (even with Sheena Easton lending her vocals) and even weaker characters and a lack of a better story results in a lively but completely forgettable fluff. A popular cats-list of voice actors including Charlie Sheen, Ernest Borgnine, Sheena Easton, Dom DeLuise and Bebe Neuwirth team up to provide a rather appealing star power to this weakling of an animated adventure. After the legendary Gabriel's Horn, which unlocks the doors to Heaven's Gate, is stolen, Charlie Barkin (voiced by Sheen) and his buddy Ithcy (voiced by DeLuise) go back to earth to retrieve it, where they also follow old "buddy" Carface (voiced by Borgnine), who happens to work for the evil cat wizard named Reginald (voiced by Tony Jay), who wants the Horn for himself. Two sub-plots are provided, but either one doesn't really help much at all. One includes a romance that goes on between Charlie and an Irish Setter singer (voiced by Easton), and the other, concerns the dogs helping a little runaway boy named David. The story is fairly weak, even considering the standards of weak non-Disney effort. Bluth will most likely find his way as a Disney successor, but he has hardly succeeds here. Even if he has a way of entertaining kids, Bluth has yet to discover the trappings to appeal adults. The result is a film that will appealing to the kids. Adults should stick to something else. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.

    Going through these posts I see that many have made mistakes when it comes to the movie --- though these mistakes are understandable. You have to pay real attention to the movie. I love this movie and I've always loved it more then the Original (I know this is VERY rare) Let me tell you my reasons why. 1. The songs are much better this time around. I love them all dearly. The ONLY song that I liked (and I barley like it) is the song that Charlie and Annabelle sing when Charlie first gets into heaven. All the other songs are dull. 2. The plot. The plot in the first movie was mostly about revenge...it wasn't nearly has good as the 2nd movie. It was nice to have Charlie fall in love with someone and end up being alive. 3. Many think that this movie makes it seem Heaven is 'boring' which isn't true. The first Heaven was dull...there seemed to be nothing, but clouds and a area filled with clocks. In this movie you can do whatever you want anytime you want. I think Charlie doesn't like heaven, because he feels as if he is missing something(I think when he dies later on he'll be happier in heaven because at least he figured out what he was missing..which was love) 4. The cat is NOT the devil. How do I know this? At the end of the movie when Carface comes out from where he was hiding he asks where Red was. Charlie then says his BOSS wanted him back (Or something like that) If Red was the Devil...he wouldn't HAVE a boss. Nor would he get sucked back into hell (He was getting sucked up BEFORE Charlie blew the horn...so it wasn't because of that) Overall it was a beautiful animated film that I adored. There really isn't anything that I don't like. Don't get me wrong I love All Dogs Go To Heaven, but the 2nd one will ALWAYS be my favorite.

    Did any remember the old characters from the original movie, "All Dogs Go To Heaven"? Now, I've heard it. They're have returned in the sequel. I was expected whom known those characters...(clears throat)....characters that do not appear in this sequel are Killer, Anne Marie, Flo and the other puppies. Killer, as we said again, later appeared in the TV series and the Christmas special. And I was on the hunt. The plot: Charlie and Itchy end up in San Francisco, then new friends....never mind. I'm not going to have it on my comic strip, Kody The Fox! Well, otherwise, I watched it at Judy's and she has the movie, I'd wish I would have the movie at my dad's, or would I rent it? The heroic fox has signed off to ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN 2.

    My cousin and I watched the All Dogs Go To Heaven films yesterday and we both liked them. But he's 6 years old and looks at this film as Oscar material, to be honest I wasn't expecting much since I was very satisfied with the way the first one ended. While I agree that this was not any where near up to par as the first one I still thought that this was a cute movie. As far as sequels go, you have to admit that All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 is better than most. The voices were actually closer than usual and the story was still pretty charming. Even though the first one seemed to have an official conclusion, this was just a new introduction for those little one's who might have missed All Dogs Go To Heaven. Charley has a new friend in Heaven, Itchy is there to join him. But Charley is getting a bit bored with the whole purity and typical days of being there. Carface has won an award for being the most turned around angel and it seems like things are working out for him, only he's really after a horn to give to Satan, or at least the Satan of dogs. But when Carface drops the horn, it goes down to Earth, Charley and Itchy are sent to get it, but Charley is quickly distracted by a beautiful dog, Shasha, who is taking care of a homeless boy, David. Since Charley is an angel, they can't see him, until he finds out that Carface, who is also down on Earth, has a special collar that will make him and Itchy visible, but Charley should watch who gives him that collar, he might be expecting something more in return. All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 is over all a cute movie. Even though that it was silly and not needed, for the kids it worked very well. The animation is pretty much like the same, but the new characters are very sweet and lovable. It's just a sweet little family film and I feel the rating is a little bit harsh, but I understand for the fans of the original. Like I said, it destroys the point of the first one, but I'm not going to spoil that for you. But I would recommend for you to give this a shot, but it's OK to just stick with the first film, that ended the story just fine. 6/10

    I seem to be one of the few people saying this, but: "All Dogs Go to Heaven 2" is actually a MAJOR step up from Bluth's 1989 original! Charlie Barkin and Itchy Itchiford are reunited in Heaven, after the latter chokes to death on a chicken bone. Charlie is bored of life in Heaven, but soon the heavenly hounds find out that Gabriel's horn has been stolen and is now in the heart of San Francisco. Charlie and Itchy must rival their old enemy Carface (who stole the horn in the first place), thwart Carface's new boss, Red the Cat Demon, and help a little boy, named David, find his way home. This is a great sequel! Great music, great characters, and a story MUCH easier to follow than its predecessor...8/10 stars! Highly recommended!!! :)

    When the Don Bluth animated classic, "All Dogs Go To Heaven", was released, it did an okay job at the box-office and became a classic. There has been some sequel's to Don Bluth's movies and most of them were terrible (Secret Of Nimh 2 for Example). But in 1996, MGM studios released a sequel to the original called, "All Dogs Go To Heaven 2". It did a bad job at the Box-Office and got a lot of negative review's from critics and fans of the original. But for me, I thought it was a decent sequel. The movie had some good animation even though it wasn't as good as the first one, it had some nice voice acting from Charlie Sheen, Sheena Easton, and it had Dom DeLuise returning as his character from the first one. The song's were also not that bad, even though I didn't care for, "Count Me Out" and "On Easy Street". Beside's the fact that I didn't like the song's, "Count Me Out" and "On Easy Street", I also thought the villain, Red, was weak and the story wasn't that good. The story was okay, but I wish it had Charlie and Itchy seeing Anne-Marie again. "All Dogs Go To Heaven", is not a bad sequel but it's not as great as the original. If you're a fan of the original, then this film is not for you. If you're someone looking for a good animated film for your kids to watch, I recommend renting the original and this one.

    If you just watched All Dogs Go To Heaven, and learn that there's a sequel, don't watch it. It's horrible. It's absolutely awful. They rush the characters to develop. Sasha, for example, begins singing about how you can count her out for love. And at the end, this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy-adventure film. They rip Charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy, soft, but still rebellious version of himself. The humor behind Carface's character is just completely lost. He's a totally different dog. He doesn't have a cool voice anymore, he isn't that villain you love to hate anymore, he's just a wimp voiced by none other than Mermaid Man from Spongebob. Speaking of voice actors.. Charlie has a completely different voice. And while it isn't horrible, I don't like it. It's terrible in comparison to the excellent job that Burt Reynolds did for the character in the first film. Dom DeLuise is wonderful as always, as Itchy. That character stays true, and that's why this film gets a 3/10. Purely because Dom DeLuise was still voicing Itchy. Oh, and my last complaint. I know Ann-Marie's movie was done and gone, she has parents now, etc, but did Charlie completely forget about her, or what? No mention at ALL of her in the second film. I mean, even a small mention from Itchy would have been acceptable. (ex. "Charlie, we have to get back. You can't take care of every kid that needs rescuing.) Or something of the sort. I mean, he died living with her, she deserves some kind of mention. Don't watch this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.

    I do like the original, despite one or two flaws. I did feel it was a little too dark for children, but it was beautifully animated and moving. This sequel is definitely inferior in comparison, but there were a few redeeming merits. The animation is not very good, there were a number of colour changes and very flat backgrounds, and I felt that the animation on Red was a bit too frightening for children. The songs were very pleasant, especially I will always be with you, but not memorable. Then again, neither were most of the songs in the original. I did like the singing voice of Charlie, provided by Jesse Conti, not so much Charlie Sheen speaking-it just wasn't Charlie. Also Sheena Easton was lovely as Sasha; if you want to know a little more about her, she sang "A Dream Worth Keeping"(FernGully) and "Now and Forever" with Barry Manilow.(Pebble and the Penguin, which I like more than this to be honest)I loved Mark Watters' incidental music too.

    Cute for the kids, but it ruins the whole point that the first film left

    My cousin and I watched the All Dogs Go To Heaven films yesterday and we both liked them. But he's 6 years old and looks at this film as Oscar material, to be honest I wasn't expecting much since I was very satisfied with the way the first one ended. While I agree that this was not any where near up to par as the first one I still thought that this was a cute movie. As far as sequels go, you have to admit that All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 is better than most. The voices were actually closer than usual and the story was still pretty charming. Even though the first one seemed to have an official conclusion, this was just a new introduction for those little one's who might have missed All Dogs Go To Heaven. Charley has a new friend in Heaven, Itchy is there to join him. But Charley is getting a bit bored with the whole purity and typical days of being there. Carface has won an award for being the most turned around angel and it seems like things are working out for him, only he's really after a horn to give to Satan, or at least the Satan of dogs. But when Carface drops the horn, it goes down to Earth, Charley and Itchy are sent to get it, but Charley is quickly distracted by a beautiful dog, Shasha, who is taking care of a homeless boy, David. Since Charley is an angel, they can't see him, until he finds out that Carface, who is also down on Earth, has a special collar that will make him and Itchy visible, but Charley should watch who gives him that collar, he might be expecting something more in return. All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 is over all a cute movie. Even though that it was silly and not needed, for the kids it worked very well. The animation is pretty much like the same, but the new characters are very sweet and lovable. It's just a sweet little family film and I feel the rating is a little bit harsh, but I understand for the fans of the original. Like I said, it destroys the point of the first one, but I'm not going to spoil that for you. But I would recommend for you to give this a shot, but it's OK to just stick with the first film, that ended the story just fine. 6/10
