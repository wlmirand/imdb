 <sinopse>
  A newspaper editor uses every trick in the book to keep his ace reporter ex-wife from remarrying.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Walter Burns, editor of a major Chicago newspaper, is about to lose his ace reporter and former wife, Hildy Johnson, to insurance salesman Bruce Baldwin, but not without a fight! The crafty editor uses every trick in his fedora to get Hildy to write one last big story, about murderer Earl Williams and the inept Sheriff Hartwell. The comedy snowballs as William's friend, Molly Malloy, the crooked Mayor, and Bruce's mother all get tied up in Walter's web.

    Quick thinking Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) is going to Albany to remarry to clueless life insurance salesman Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). Her ex-husband is also her ex-boss newspaper editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant). He will do all the scheming needed to keep her in the city and stop the wedding. This is a fast talking movie. If you don't pay attention, you'll miss the jokes before you know it. Howard Hawks has directed a classic poking fun at the corrupt politicians and amoral journalists. It's funny and Rosalind Russell is perfect as the brash writer. She got the chops to get the better of the other male actors, and rattle off the lines like a machine gun.

    Nearly no mainstream films, pitched as they are to the infamous "key demo" of young dudes and bros, have female leading roles one-tenth so funny and fully-realized as reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell). She is "His Girl Friday," the focus of nearly every scene. Alone among the screwballs that populate this rather cynical comedy, she is someone real enough to like and to root for. Her ambitions and values reach beyond the immediate demands of the story, and her skills as a writer and investigator are compelling. Her ex-husband, who is also the editor of her paper, is funny because he's so perfectly passive-aggressive and because he is played by Cary Grant, master deliverer of cutting remarks. By himself, though, the character would make a poor protagonist. Hildy's current fianc&eacute;, hopelessly dense and dull, would be even worse. Only she can pull off the combination of physical comedy (running through traffic to tackle a source for a big scoop), rapid-fire barbs ("Now get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee. There ain't gonna be any interview and there ain't gonna be any story... I wouldn't cover the burning of Rome for you if they were just lighting it up"), and self-serving schemes (obstructing justice and manipulating suspects for the sake of a front-page byline) without losing the relatability that makes the movie more than mechanical farce.

    A very pleasant surprise (and never boring), "His Girl Friday" is a movie with such a crackling script that you kinda feel dizzy at the end after keeping up with the lightning-quick dialogue. This is my first Cary Grant movie (never too late to start, right?), and his leading man hair and dimpled chin star power ably support his foray into such a screwball comedy. His character is so amoral that the guy's just ... he's damn likable. But the real star of this movie (at least, to me) is Rosalind Russell. I know nothing of the play on which this is based, but I wouldn't be surprised if her character was originally a man. She trades jabs with the other newsboys like a fellow man. But this is hardly a complaint; it makes Russell and her character a thrill to watch. She's the fulcrum on which the story pivots and it's heartening to see her go toe-to-toe with any other male character. Poor Ralph Bellamy's naive character has to play straight-man to the others' chicanery, but he's at least the beneficiary of one of the movie's best lines (and a bit of meta humor that directly references himself as an actor). What's really surprising is just how many laughs come from the supporting players. A fine movie, at that. 8/10

    I didn't realize how much I love screwball comedies until watching "My Man Godfrey" in film class, but then I couldn't wait to watch another (and more!). "His Girl Friday" was a great pickI love Rosalind Russell and she gives such great life into Hildy's character. The fast pace of the entire flick kept my constant attention (and honestly felt like sitting around the table at holidays with familyeveryone talking at once!). The subtle jokes could easily be missed if one wasn't paying attention, like the mention of Bellamy's character looking like "that guy from the movies, Bellamy." Ha! Of course Cary Grant is wonderful as ever in using his facial expressions to convey what he's really thinking for the audience even if other characters aren't meant to notice. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs an introduction into the genre.

    His Girl Friday is a fast talking and fast moving film on romance and journalism. Although its a hilarious screwball comedy I also felt like the film made some interesting commentary on journalism and maybe on the passions of life. The film really brings the feeling of a news room with constant rapid dialogue, always cutting each other off in a way that feels realistic, but also pushes the film forward and makes it feel much faster than it is. Although the romance is a main point of the film it does so without pushing it and having only one real sappy moment quickly pushed aside by Walter in a way that is brilliant, but also shows how nothing has really changed and Hildy has simply returned to her roots. Overall I thought the entire film was hilarious and perfectly paced to keep the film moving throughout its duration. This film may have turned me on to screwball comedies as a whole.

    To be honest, I expected this movie to be different from how it was. The beginning started out well, I was interesting and I was following it. Then it went into another direction entirely. Suddenly there were a dozen characters and I could barely keep up with names or who was who. The entire movie seemed to just be people shouting over the top of everyone else, so I could barely understand information and sort it out in my mind. It probably didn't help anything that even though I was in a quiet area with my volume up, the sound in the copy of the movie I saw was very low. Another thing was the way jokes were peppered into the conversation, but the characters were speaking a mile a minute. So really, I was only able to get the real gist of the plot.

    This film was absolutely phenomenal! Grant and Russel make an absolutely wonderful pair in this fast-paced movie. They compliment each other very well in every way. The dialogue throughout the movie is very funny, if you can keep up! The storyline of "His Girl Friday" was very interesting and unique, it was a really good plot to follow. Some of the things Hildy's character said throughout the film were absolutely hysterical, her whole character was great, in fact. This movie may have been fast- paced, but the content more than made up for that detail. This was definitely a comical classic film, and it is highly recommended to anyone who has not yet seen it.

    Hildy Johnson makes quite the spunky female character: independent, boisterous, take-charge. She really livens the movie up. There are some scenes to this movie which are really far-fetched. There's the scene where the lady jumps two stories to the streets below. How is she still alive? Then, there's the final scene with the murderer, where they hide him inside a desk to avoid his detection. How he managed to survive that long without air is beyond me, and even more bizarre is that when they pull him out, he's still alive, too. I would have liked to see the wedding between Hildy and her former ex-husband at the end of the movie; I can't believe he didn't take her on a Honeymoon the first time around.... Overall, well put together movie, but not without its flaws.

    Well this movie was a lot like "My Man Godfrey" but that is not a bad thing. This particular movie has a more in depth plot.. or maybe not. Anyway, this movie had great fluidity although at times it seemed like too much was going on. I enjoyed the characters, they give you a good idea of how newspaper journalists used to work back in the day. You learn things about the past and how things used to be through old movies such as these. The plot was great and it had several twists that you never see coming. I feel bad for the main character a little but later you learn that everything works out well. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it!

    This film was tough to follow at first because of all the dialogue but soon enough i was into it and did actually enjoy watching the whacked out relationship Walter and Hildy had. The movie is very fast paced so it wouldn't be recommended for younger viewers because the story might get confusing and the jokes might not make sense to them. Both the acting and directing of this film are both top notch work and really help pull everything together in the plot. I found it interesting that a comedy movie could dip it's toes in touchy subject matter (murder, execution, suicide) and still be funny from started to finish especially in the 1940's. The nice mixture of romantic comedy and satire help the flow of the film as do the supporting roles. Another great screwball comedy from a golden era of movie making. If you are thinking of seeing this movie stop debating on what to watch and let Howard Hanks work his magic. I almost wish Walter and Hildy had worked things out.

    His Girl Friday is a fast talking and fast moving film on romance and journalism. Although its a hilarious screwball comedy I also felt like the film made some interesting commentary on journalism and maybe on the passions of life. The film really brings the feeling of a news room with constant rapid dialogue, always cutting each other off in a way that feels realistic, but also pushes the film forward and makes it feel much faster than it is. Although the romance is a main point of the film it does so without pushing it and having only one real sappy moment quickly pushed aside by Walter in a way that is brilliant, but also shows how nothing has really changed and Hildy has simply returned to her roots. Overall I thought the entire film was hilarious and perfectly paced to keep the film moving throughout its duration. This film may have turned me on to screwball comedies as a whole.

    To be honest, I expected this movie to be different from how it was. The beginning started out well, I was interesting and I was following it. Then it went into another direction entirely. Suddenly there were a dozen characters and I could barely keep up with names or who was who. The entire movie seemed to just be people shouting over the top of everyone else, so I could barely understand information and sort it out in my mind. It probably didn't help anything that even though I was in a quiet area with my volume up, the sound in the copy of the movie I saw was very low. Another thing was the way jokes were peppered into the conversation, but the characters were speaking a mile a minute. So really, I was only able to get the real gist of the plot.

    This film was absolutely phenomenal! Grant and Russel make an absolutely wonderful pair in this fast-paced movie. They compliment each other very well in every way. The dialogue throughout the movie is very funny, if you can keep up! The storyline of "His Girl Friday" was very interesting and unique, it was a really good plot to follow. Some of the things Hildy's character said throughout the film were absolutely hysterical, her whole character was great, in fact. This movie may have been fast- paced, but the content more than made up for that detail. This was definitely a comical classic film, and it is highly recommended to anyone who has not yet seen it.

    Hildy Johnson makes quite the spunky female character: independent, boisterous, take-charge. She really livens the movie up. There are some scenes to this movie which are really far-fetched. There's the scene where the lady jumps two stories to the streets below. How is she still alive? Then, there's the final scene with the murderer, where they hide him inside a desk to avoid his detection. How he managed to survive that long without air is beyond me, and even more bizarre is that when they pull him out, he's still alive, too. I would have liked to see the wedding between Hildy and her former ex-husband at the end of the movie; I can't believe he didn't take her on a Honeymoon the first time around.... Overall, well put together movie, but not without its flaws.

    Well this movie was a lot like "My Man Godfrey" but that is not a bad thing. This particular movie has a more in depth plot.. or maybe not. Anyway, this movie had great fluidity although at times it seemed like too much was going on. I enjoyed the characters, they give you a good idea of how newspaper journalists used to work back in the day. You learn things about the past and how things used to be through old movies such as these. The plot was great and it had several twists that you never see coming. I feel bad for the main character a little but later you learn that everything works out well. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it!

    This film was tough to follow at first because of all the dialogue but soon enough i was into it and did actually enjoy watching the whacked out relationship Walter and Hildy had. The movie is very fast paced so it wouldn't be recommended for younger viewers because the story might get confusing and the jokes might not make sense to them. Both the acting and directing of this film are both top notch work and really help pull everything together in the plot. I found it interesting that a comedy movie could dip it's toes in touchy subject matter (murder, execution, suicide) and still be funny from started to finish especially in the 1940's. The nice mixture of romantic comedy and satire help the flow of the film as do the supporting roles. Another great screwball comedy from a golden era of movie making. If you are thinking of seeing this movie stop debating on what to watch and let Howard Hanks work his magic. I almost wish Walter and Hildy had worked things out.

    Quick thinking Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) is going to Albany to remarry to clueless life insurance salesman Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). Her ex-husband is also her ex-boss newspaper editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant). He will do all the scheming needed to keep her in the city and stop the wedding. This is a fast talking movie. If you don't pay attention, you'll miss the jokes before you know it. Howard Hawks has directed a classic poking fun at the corrupt politicians and amoral journalists. It's funny and Rosalind Russell is perfect as the brash writer. She got the chops to get the better of the other male actors, and rattle off the lines like a machine gun.

    Nearly no mainstream films, pitched as they are to the infamous "key demo" of young dudes and bros, have female leading roles one-tenth so funny and fully-realized as reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell). She is "His Girl Friday," the focus of nearly every scene. Alone among the screwballs that populate this rather cynical comedy, she is someone real enough to like and to root for. Her ambitions and values reach beyond the immediate demands of the story, and her skills as a writer and investigator are compelling. Her ex-husband, who is also the editor of her paper, is funny because he's so perfectly passive-aggressive and because he is played by Cary Grant, master deliverer of cutting remarks. By himself, though, the character would make a poor protagonist. Hildy's current fianc&eacute;, hopelessly dense and dull, would be even worse. Only she can pull off the combination of physical comedy (running through traffic to tackle a source for a big scoop), rapid-fire barbs ("Now get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee. There ain't gonna be any interview and there ain't gonna be any story... I wouldn't cover the burning of Rome for you if they were just lighting it up"), and self-serving schemes (obstructing justice and manipulating suspects for the sake of a front-page byline) without losing the relatability that makes the movie more than mechanical farce.

    A very pleasant surprise (and never boring), "His Girl Friday" is a movie with such a crackling script that you kinda feel dizzy at the end after keeping up with the lightning-quick dialogue. This is my first Cary Grant movie (never too late to start, right?), and his leading man hair and dimpled chin star power ably support his foray into such a screwball comedy. His character is so amoral that the guy's just ... he's damn likable. But the real star of this movie (at least, to me) is Rosalind Russell. I know nothing of the play on which this is based, but I wouldn't be surprised if her character was originally a man. She trades jabs with the other newsboys like a fellow man. But this is hardly a complaint; it makes Russell and her character a thrill to watch. She's the fulcrum on which the story pivots and it's heartening to see her go toe-to-toe with any other male character. Poor Ralph Bellamy's naive character has to play straight-man to the others' chicanery, but he's at least the beneficiary of one of the movie's best lines (and a bit of meta humor that directly references himself as an actor). What's really surprising is just how many laughs come from the supporting players. A fine movie, at that. 8/10

    I didn't realize how much I love screwball comedies until watching "My Man Godfrey" in film class, but then I couldn't wait to watch another (and more!). "His Girl Friday" was a great pickI love Rosalind Russell and she gives such great life into Hildy's character. The fast pace of the entire flick kept my constant attention (and honestly felt like sitting around the table at holidays with familyeveryone talking at once!). The subtle jokes could easily be missed if one wasn't paying attention, like the mention of Bellamy's character looking like "that guy from the movies, Bellamy." Ha! Of course Cary Grant is wonderful as ever in using his facial expressions to convey what he's really thinking for the audience even if other characters aren't meant to notice. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs an introduction into the genre.

    Nearly no mainstream films, pitched as they are to the infamous "key demo" of young dudes and bros, have female leading roles one-tenth so funny and fully-realized as reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell). She is "His Girl Friday," the focus of nearly every scene. Alone among the screwballs that populate this rather cynical comedy, she is someone real enough to like and to root for. Her ambitions and values reach beyond the immediate demands of the story, and her skills as a writer and investigator are compelling. Her ex-husband, who is also the editor of her paper, is funny because he's so perfectly passive-aggressive and because he is played by Cary Grant, master deliverer of cutting remarks. By himself, though, the character would make a poor protagonist. Hildy's current fianc&eacute;, hopelessly dense and dull, would be even worse. Only she can pull off the combination of physical comedy (running through traffic to tackle a source for a big scoop), rapid-fire barbs ("Now get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee. There ain't gonna be any interview and there ain't gonna be any story... I wouldn't cover the burning of Rome for you if they were just lighting it up"), and self-serving schemes (obstructing justice and manipulating suspects for the sake of a front-page byline) without losing the relatability that makes the movie more than mechanical farce.

    A very pleasant surprise (and never boring), "His Girl Friday" is a movie with such a crackling script that you kinda feel dizzy at the end after keeping up with the lightning-quick dialogue. This is my first Cary Grant movie (never too late to start, right?), and his leading man hair and dimpled chin star power ably support his foray into such a screwball comedy. His character is so amoral that the guy's just ... he's damn likable. But the real star of this movie (at least, to me) is Rosalind Russell. I know nothing of the play on which this is based, but I wouldn't be surprised if her character was originally a man. She trades jabs with the other newsboys like a fellow man. But this is hardly a complaint; it makes Russell and her character a thrill to watch. She's the fulcrum on which the story pivots and it's heartening to see her go toe-to-toe with any other male character. Poor Ralph Bellamy's naive character has to play straight-man to the others' chicanery, but he's at least the beneficiary of one of the movie's best lines (and a bit of meta humor that directly references himself as an actor). What's really surprising is just how many laughs come from the supporting players. A fine movie, at that. 8/10

    I didn't realize how much I love screwball comedies until watching "My Man Godfrey" in film class, but then I couldn't wait to watch another (and more!). "His Girl Friday" was a great pickI love Rosalind Russell and she gives such great life into Hildy's character. The fast pace of the entire flick kept my constant attention (and honestly felt like sitting around the table at holidays with familyeveryone talking at once!). The subtle jokes could easily be missed if one wasn't paying attention, like the mention of Bellamy's character looking like "that guy from the movies, Bellamy." Ha! Of course Cary Grant is wonderful as ever in using his facial expressions to convey what he's really thinking for the audience even if other characters aren't meant to notice. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs an introduction into the genre.

    His Girl Friday is a fast talking and fast moving film on romance and journalism. Although its a hilarious screwball comedy I also felt like the film made some interesting commentary on journalism and maybe on the passions of life. The film really brings the feeling of a news room with constant rapid dialogue, always cutting each other off in a way that feels realistic, but also pushes the film forward and makes it feel much faster than it is. Although the romance is a main point of the film it does so without pushing it and having only one real sappy moment quickly pushed aside by Walter in a way that is brilliant, but also shows how nothing has really changed and Hildy has simply returned to her roots. Overall I thought the entire film was hilarious and perfectly paced to keep the film moving throughout its duration. This film may have turned me on to screwball comedies as a whole.

    To be honest, I expected this movie to be different from how it was. The beginning started out well, I was interesting and I was following it. Then it went into another direction entirely. Suddenly there were a dozen characters and I could barely keep up with names or who was who. The entire movie seemed to just be people shouting over the top of everyone else, so I could barely understand information and sort it out in my mind. It probably didn't help anything that even though I was in a quiet area with my volume up, the sound in the copy of the movie I saw was very low. Another thing was the way jokes were peppered into the conversation, but the characters were speaking a mile a minute. So really, I was only able to get the real gist of the plot.

There's the scene where the lady jumps two stories to the streets below. How is she still alive? Then, there's the final scene with the murderer, where they hide him inside a desk to avoid his detection. How he managed to survive that long without air is beyond me, and even more bizarre is that when they pull him out, he's still alive, too. I would have liked to see the wedding between Hildy and her former ex-husband at the end of the movie; I can't believe he didn't take her on a Honeymoon the first time around.... Overall, well put together movie, but not without its flaws.

    Well this movie was a lot like "My Man Godfrey" but that is not a bad thing. This particular movie has a more in depth plot.. or maybe not. Anyway, this movie had great fluidity although at times it seemed like too much was going on. I enjoyed the characters, they give you a good idea of how newspaper journalists used to work back in the day. You learn things about the past and how things used to be through old movies such as these. The plot was great and it had several twists that you never see coming. I feel bad for the main character a little but later you learn that everything works out well. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it!

    This film was tough to follow at first because of all the dialogue but soon enough i was into it and did actually enjoy watching the whacked out relationship Walter and Hildy had. The movie is very fast paced so it wouldn't be recommended for younger viewers because the story might get confusing and the jokes might not make sense to them. Both the acting and directing of this film are both top notch work and really help pull everything together in the plot. I found it interesting that a comedy movie could dip it's toes in touchy subject matter (murder, execution, suicide) and still be funny from started to finish especially in the 1940's. The nice mixture of romantic comedy and satire help the flow of the film as do the supporting roles. Another great screwball comedy from a golden era of movie making. If you are thinking of seeing this movie stop debating on what to watch and let Howard Hanks work his magic. I almost wish Walter and Hildy had worked things out.

    Quick thinking Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) is going to Albany to remarry to clueless life insurance salesman Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). Her ex-husband is also her ex-boss newspaper editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant). He will do all the scheming needed to keep her in the city and stop the wedding. This is a fast talking movie. If you don't pay attention, you'll miss the jokes before you know it. Howard Hawks has directed a classic poking fun at the corrupt politicians and amoral journalists. It's funny and Rosalind Russell is perfect as the brash writer. She got the chops to get the better of the other male actors, and rattle off the lines like a machine gun.

Then, there's the final scene with the murderer, where they hide him inside a desk to avoid his detection. How he managed to survive that long without air is beyond me, and even more bizarre is that when they pull him out, he's still alive, too. I would have liked to see the wedding between Hildy and her former ex-husband at the end of the movie; I can't believe he didn't take her on a Honeymoon the first time around.... Overall, well put together movie, but not without its flaws.

    Well this movie was a lot like "My Man Godfrey" but that is not a bad thing. This particular movie has a more in depth plot.. or maybe not. Anyway, this movie had great fluidity although at times it seemed like too much was going on. I enjoyed the characters, they give you a good idea of how newspaper journalists used to work back in the day. You learn things about the past and how things used to be through old movies such as these. The plot was great and it had several twists that you never see coming. I feel bad for the main character a little but later you learn that everything works out well. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it!

    This film was tough to follow at first because of all the dialogue but soon enough i was into it and did actually enjoy watching the whacked out relationship Walter and Hildy had. The movie is very fast paced so it wouldn't be recommended for younger viewers because the story might get confusing and the jokes might not make sense to them. Both the acting and directing of this film are both top notch work and really help pull everything together in the plot. I found it interesting that a comedy movie could dip it's toes in touchy subject matter (murder, execution, suicide) and still be funny from started to finish especially in the 1940's. The nice mixture of romantic comedy and satire help the flow of the film as do the supporting roles. Another great screwball comedy from a golden era of movie making. If you are thinking of seeing this movie stop debating on what to watch and let Howard Hanks work his magic. I almost wish Walter and Hildy had worked things out.

    Quick thinking Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) is going to Albany to remarry to clueless life insurance salesman Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). Her ex-husband is also her ex-boss newspaper editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant). He will do all the scheming needed to keep her in the city and stop the wedding. This is a fast talking movie. If you don't pay attention, you'll miss the jokes before you know it. Howard Hawks has directed a classic poking fun at the corrupt politicians and amoral journalists. It's funny and Rosalind Russell is perfect as the brash writer. She got the chops to get the better of the other male actors, and rattle off the lines like a machine gun.

    Nearly no mainstream films, pitched as they are to the infamous "key demo" of young dudes and bros, have female leading roles one-tenth so funny and fully-realized as reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell). She is "His Girl Friday," the focus of nearly every scene. Alone among the screwballs that populate this rather cynical comedy, she is someone real enough to like and to root for. Her ambitions and values reach beyond the immediate demands of the story, and her skills as a writer and investigator are compelling. Her ex-husband, who is also the editor of her paper, is funny because he's so perfectly passive-aggressive and because he is played by Cary Grant, master deliverer of cutting remarks. By himself, though, the character would make a poor protagonist. Hildy's current fianc&eacute;, hopelessly dense and dull, would be even worse. Only she can pull off the combination of physical comedy (running through traffic to tackle a source for a big scoop), rapid-fire barbs ("Now get this, you double-crossing chimpanzee. There ain't gonna be any interview and there ain't gonna be any story... I wouldn't cover the burning of Rome for you if they were just lighting it up"), and self-serving schemes (obstructing justice and manipulating suspects for the sake of a front-page byline) without losing the relatability that makes the movie more than mechanical farce.

    A very pleasant surprise (and never boring), "His Girl Friday" is a movie with such a crackling script that you kinda feel dizzy at the end after keeping up with the lightning-quick dialogue. This is my first Cary Grant movie (never too late to start, right?), and his leading man hair and dimpled chin star power ably support his foray into such a screwball comedy. His character is so amoral that the guy's just ... he's damn likable. But the real star of this movie (at least, to me) is Rosalind Russell. I know nothing of the play on which this is based, but I wouldn't be surprised if her character was originally a man. She trades jabs with the other newsboys like a fellow man. But this is hardly a complaint; it makes Russell and her character a thrill to watch. She's the fulcrum on which the story pivots and it's heartening to see her go toe-to-toe with any other male character. Poor Ralph Bellamy's naive character has to play straight-man to the others' chicanery, but he's at least the beneficiary of one of the movie's best lines (and a bit of meta humor that directly references himself as an actor). What's really surprising is just how many laughs come from the supporting players. A fine movie, at that. 8/10

    I didn't realize how much I love screwball comedies until watching "My Man Godfrey" in film class, but then I couldn't wait to watch another (and more!). "His Girl Friday" was a great pickI love Rosalind Russell and she gives such great life into Hildy's character. The fast pace of the entire flick kept my constant attention (and honestly felt like sitting around the table at holidays with familyeveryone talking at once!). The subtle jokes could easily be missed if one wasn't paying attention, like the mention of Bellamy's character looking like "that guy from the movies, Bellamy." Ha! Of course Cary Grant is wonderful as ever in using his facial expressions to convey what he's really thinking for the audience even if other characters aren't meant to notice. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs an introduction into the genre.

    His Girl Friday is a fast talking and fast moving film on romance and journalism. Although its a hilarious screwball comedy I also felt like the film made some interesting commentary on journalism and maybe on the passions of life. The film really brings the feeling of a news room with constant rapid dialogue, always cutting each other off in a way that feels realistic, but also pushes the film forward and makes it feel much faster than it is. Although the romance is a main point of the film it does so without pushing it and having only one real sappy moment quickly pushed aside by Walter in a way that is brilliant, but also shows how nothing has really changed and Hildy has simply returned to her roots. Overall I thought the entire film was hilarious and perfectly paced to keep the film moving throughout its duration. This film may have turned me on to screwball comedies as a whole.

    To be honest, I expected this movie to be different from how it was. The beginning started out well, I was interesting and I was following it. Then it went into another direction entirely. Suddenly there were a dozen characters and I could barely keep up with names or who was who. The entire movie seemed to just be people shouting over the top of everyone else, so I could barely understand information and sort it out in my mind. It probably didn't help anything that even though I was in a quiet area with my volume up, the sound in the copy of the movie I saw was very low. Another thing was the way jokes were peppered into the conversation, but the characters were speaking a mile a minute. So really, I was only able to get the real gist of the plot.

    This film was absolutely phenomenal! Grant and Russel make an absolutely wonderful pair in this fast-paced movie. They compliment each other very well in every way. The dialogue throughout the movie is very funny, if you can keep up! The storyline of "His Girl Friday" was very interesting and unique, it was a really good plot to follow. Some of the things Hildy's character said throughout the film were absolutely hysterical, her whole character was great, in fact. This movie may have been fast- paced, but the content more than made up for that detail. This was definitely a comical classic film, and it is highly recommended to anyone who has not yet seen it.

There's the scene where the lady jumps two stories to the streets below. How is she still alive? Then, there's the final scene with the murderer, where they hide him inside a desk to avoid his detection. How he managed to survive that long without air is beyond me, and even more bizarre is that when they pull him out, he's still alive, too.
