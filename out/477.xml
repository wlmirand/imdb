    This Outstanding film is a great way to get a family including young children to spend quality time together. Not only is it comical for all ages, it teaches young children valuable life lessons. I've watched it time and time again to the point I can mouth the words, yet it never gets old. It's full of joy and laughter as an ordinary young girl discovers she isn't like her friends at school. It's a great film to chill out and bring back the child in you. Although its a children's film, it can make you think in ways you wouldn't of previously done. It uses catchy phrases to make your mind wonder. Once watching it the first time, you Will be edging to watch it again or buy it on DVD whilst children will be nagging for it to Be On. It's one of the most memorable films I've seen, and I highly recommend it to viewers of all ages.

    This is certainly not a comedy, nor a family movie, it is actually against the family. I would easily compare this to An American Crime (2007) movie. Filmmakers understate and trying to make funny a vy sad situation of a girl born to an egoistic and dysfunctional family with a crook bad tempered father, self centered mother and a bully brother where no one cares about one another. How can someone say that psychologically abused children should watch this movie, it would only reopened their wounds and would have to take more antidepressants then before and watching that crazy monster headmistress throwing kids around or chasing them in that dark filthy house full of chambers of horror. Common, this is not a family or comedy movie. And the last scene, where they easily signed the adoption forms and got rid of their daughter was so hard to watch that any child watching this would get the whole life trauma and would have nightmares long after. And that nauseous scene where the fat boy is punished by eating the whole cake, and ... and ... But maybe it is just me, I don't know.

    The movie was super scary even for my 8 year old. She cried and almost felt sick because it was very gory. Advisable to watch with a parent that can explain to kids that movies are not real. My daughter watched this at school, and quite a few kids had to leave the auditorium. She did mention that there were some funny parts but the plot was very scary to her. I think that i may eventually watch this again with my kids a few years from now. I think the minimum age should be 10 years old, but i guess it depends on the kid. On another note, my 6 year old little man, did not find it too scary. We are writing this review by her urging, because she is concerned that other kids will watch it and feel like she did. So she just wants to warn everyone!!!

    In Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl addressed the problems adults face when they must deal with bratty children. In Matilda, he addresses the troubles a sweet child faces when she must deal with problem adults. I was surprised this adorable movie was not receiving better ratings, so I read the reviews of the people who hated it. One wonders what the moral was. Of course, not every children's movie has a moral. What's the moral of Harry Potter or Goonies? But this one has an obvious moral. Are there not bullies in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Are there not kind people in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Beyond morals, there's an important message. The movie tells mistreated children, in more ways than one: "you are not alone". For those wondering why Dahl did not create a dark, depressing, hopeless story for children surviving in bad homes, rather than a funny comedy, I suspect it's because the children facing such struggles don't need more darkness and hopelessness in their lives. Sure, it's a dark comedy, but that's the only way to reach such children about their problems and still bring them an uplifting movie. What's so bad about a dark comedy? Research shows that a child's quality of life is directly correlated to their mother's IQ. Most abusive and neglectful parents are simply idiots. Do mistreated children exist in this country? Ask CPS. Why should all children's movies ignore this fact? There was a time when everyone just ignored the problem completely, because it made adults that uncomfortable to deal with what was actually happening to children, but I'd rather move forward than backwards. To make matters worse, the brighter a child is, the greater his risk of abuse by jealous, stupid parents. Abraham Maslow had an IQ of 195. When he was a child, his abusive mother discovered some kittens he'd rescued and killed the kittens by beating their heads against a wall. He had many moments of despair during his childhood, and surely would have appreciated a movie like this. Being forced to care for one's self and cope so early no doubt forces kids to grow up quickly. True, many mistreated children might just be intellectually average kids who, unfortunately for them, happen to have stupid parents, so perhaps Dahl should have worried about inflating those kids' egos. There is a genius kid in the new Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but none of the reviewers are pouring venom about it. Is it just because Matilda's a girl? Heaven forbid kids get the idea that educating themselves might help them solve some of their problems, or that a love of learning is something to be proud of. Harry Potter and Annie are both movies with evil adults, some of whom try to kill the kids, yet the reviewers don't seem confused about why the adults are evil. If every adult you met in your childhood made perfect sense, was smarter than you, and never subjected you to mistreatment due to their own insecurities, then good for you. This movie is not for you. It's for the rest of us. I commend the creators of this movie for having the guts to reach out to such kids, before their despair drives them to suicide, even if some people say "but my parents were good, so why did you create a movie with bad parents?" Take a look at white trash America. I am also thrilled it was turned into a Broadway musical. Obviously, some people get it.

    The 1996 film, Matilda, has been a classic ever since it was released. This movie is one of my personal favorites due to its humorous yet touching plot. If you're looking for the perfect film to watch with your family all snuggled up with a bag of popcorn, this movie is for you. Due to its appeal to both young and old audiences, this movie is hard to criticize. While most of the movie is light-hearted due to Matilda's charming innocence amongst the negativity around her, other parts of the movie exhibit heart-wrenching situations that a kid shouldn't have to endure, efficiently teaching genuine life lessons about the importance of family. Matilda, only five years old at the start of the movie, is the youngest person in her family. Her parents barely acknowledge that she's alive by constantly favoring their older son, Michael, and disregarding anything that Matilda says. The audience is immediately attracted to Matilda's polite charm and ability to stay positive despite the fact that her family has neglected her. At just five years old, Matilda learns to live by herself; cooking and cleaning without any help from her family. Although a five year old providing for his or herself is wrong and meant to be sympathized, the audience can't help but adore Matilda's charisma and innocence in what should be a sad and somber situation. When Matilda's burning desire to learn finally convinces her dad to enroll her in school, she meets many people that actually care about her. Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, and all of her classmates are amazed at the amount of knowledge she already has at such a young age. On top of being the smartest in her class, Matilda is also well-liked by her peers. It is encouraging for the audience to see Matilda finally getting the attention she lacks at home. At school, Matilda's best friends, Lavender and Hortensia, constantly urge her to use her secret telekinetic powers. When the evil principal, Miss Trunchbull, came to Miss Honey's class one day, Matilda used her telekinetic powers to spill Miss Trunchbull's water glass everywhere to make her leave the room. By giving Matilda fictional telekinetic powers, it creates a sense of magic that both young and old audiences can relate to. Amongst the trouble that Matilda goes through at home, the magical powers she has can be seen as a symbol of strength. One of the main reasons that this movie is outstanding is because it's not only adult-friendly, but it's also kid-friendly. The plot is a perfect combination of serious and humorous events. The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.

    Adversity serves as the mother of invention for the characters in director Danny Devito's "Matilda," imaginative juvenile fantasy inspired by British author Roald Dahl bestseller. Previously, Hollywood tapped another Dahl effort "James and the Giant Peach" that met with indifferent box office results. The best rendering thus far of a Dahl tale was "The Witches" (1990) where a little boy is turned into a mouse by a local coven. Although aimed at an adolescent audience, "Matilda" emerges as a tolerably sticky gray (just short of black comedy whose rich visual style provides something for adults to savor. Distorted lens and low-angle photography give this yarn an optical sophistication that older audiences will appreciate and a carnival atmosphere that will delight younger audiences. Devito appears to be imitating Terry Gilliam's bizarre film fantasies like "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys." Aside from the title heroine and her peers, the adult characters are not only warped but downright freakish. What could have been a depressing tale about a neglected and unwanted little girl takes on an upbeat mischievous quality. The filmmakers suggest that the younger you are the better, and that adulthood sabotages the joys of adolescence. As the film unfolds, Harry Wormwood (Danny Devito of "Batman Returns") takes one look at his newborn baby daughter, screws his face up in disgust, and walks out. Wormwood is a sleazy, low-life, miser who sells junk autos at sky rocket prices and traffics in purloined car parts. The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents. While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set. Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme. If the obnoxious Wormwoods and Ms. Trunchbull represent hideous extroverts, then Miss Honey epitomizes the humble introvert. Clearly, "Matilda" endorses the latter behavior. The only good adults are the docile adults. Mara Wilson steals the show as the eponymous protagonist. You may remember Mara from the Robin Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire." If you adore her saccharine personality in that movie, you will love "Matilda." Arguably, "Matilda" falls short of being a classic because both the character of Matilda and actress Mara Wilson are far too cute to be credible. Funny and inventive as it is at times, "Matilda" never escapes its repressively formulaic origins. Children will obviously have more fun at "Matilda" than adults.

    Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender. True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British "Headmistress" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American "Principal". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it. But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant. In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian  where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

    Story of a girl, story of life. Matilda, Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey,... Names that will remain in my head forever. Matilda was my childhood favorite movie. When I was 12, I watched it almost everyday, mostly at the school's video club during lunch times, till I turned 15. I love this movie because it is entertaining, touching, funny, the dialogues are convincing, actors are playing their roles with great success and the music from David Newman that perfectly fits to the movie is just beautiful and pleasant to listen to. I read the book many times and this movie is one of the rarest production that preserves the story and the atmosphere from the book. Of course, some details and scenes from the book have voluntary been cut or re-adapted but these changes doesn't affect on the magic of the writing. Mara Wilson is a great actress on it. Her leading role as a kid suffering from misunderstanding by her family, leading her to use later on her "special ability" to gain respect from her surrounding or bring some justice back is just perfect. When I was a kid, this movie touched me because I identified myself to Matilda. After parent's divorce, my childhood life was the same as Matilda's: parents looked upon me as nothing more as a scab and I had some nasty teachers. The movie helped me a lot to keep some happiness. I am 24 right now, and I decided to watch it again. It's the only movie in the world in which I can spend hours watching in a row in circle like a kid without feeling bored. And watching it one time is enough to bring some joy of living for a few days. My future kids will love it. This movie is universal for a whole generation, even if unfortunately, it's not very famous. It deserves to be because it's a lesson for kids and parents about life. But I spread this beautiful piece of art amongst my friends and they all enjoyed it. It deserves a bluray adaptation.

Of course, not every children's movie has a moral. What's the moral of Harry Potter or Goonies? But this one has an obvious moral. Are there not bullies in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Are there not kind people in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Beyond morals, there's an important message. The movie tells mistreated children, in more ways than one: "you are not alone". For those wondering why Dahl did not create a dark, depressing, hopeless story for children surviving in bad homes, rather than a funny comedy, I suspect it's because the children facing such struggles don't need more darkness and hopelessness in their lives. Sure, it's a dark comedy, but that's the only way to reach such children about their problems and still bring them an uplifting movie. What's so bad about a dark comedy? Research shows that a child's quality of life is directly correlated to their mother's IQ. Most abusive and neglectful parents are simply idiots. Do mistreated children exist in this country? Ask CPS. Why should all children's movies ignore this fact? There was a time when everyone just ignored the problem completely, because it made adults that uncomfortable to deal with what was actually happening to children, but I'd rather move forward than backwards. To make matters worse, the brighter a child is, the greater his risk of abuse by jealous, stupid parents. Abraham Maslow had an IQ of 195. When he was a child, his abusive mother discovered some kittens he'd rescued and killed the kittens by beating their heads against a wall. He had many moments of despair during his childhood, and surely would have appreciated a movie like this. Being forced to care for one's self and cope so early no doubt forces kids to grow up quickly. True, many mistreated children might just be intellectually average kids who, unfortunately for them, happen to have stupid parents, so perhaps Dahl should have worried about inflating those kids' egos. There is a genius kid in the new Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but none of the reviewers are pouring venom about it. Is it just because Matilda's a girl? Heaven forbid kids get the idea that educating themselves might help them solve some of their problems, or that a love of learning is something to be proud of. Harry Potter and Annie are both movies with evil adults, some of whom try to kill the kids, yet the reviewers don't seem confused about why the adults are evil. If every adult you met in your childhood made perfect sense, was smarter than you, and never subjected you to mistreatment due to their own insecurities, then good for you. This movie is not for you. It's for the rest of us. I commend the creators of this movie for having the guts to reach out to such kids, before their despair drives them to suicide, even if some people say "but my parents were good, so why did you create a movie with bad parents?" Take a look at white trash America. I am also thrilled it was turned into a Broadway musical. Obviously, some people get it.

    The 1996 film, Matilda, has been a classic ever since it was released. This movie is one of my personal favorites due to its humorous yet touching plot. If you're looking for the perfect film to watch with your family all snuggled up with a bag of popcorn, this movie is for you. Due to its appeal to both young and old audiences, this movie is hard to criticize. While most of the movie is light-hearted due to Matilda's charming innocence amongst the negativity around her, other parts of the movie exhibit heart-wrenching situations that a kid shouldn't have to endure, efficiently teaching genuine life lessons about the importance of family. Matilda, only five years old at the start of the movie, is the youngest person in her family. Her parents barely acknowledge that she's alive by constantly favoring their older son, Michael, and disregarding anything that Matilda says. The audience is immediately attracted to Matilda's polite charm and ability to stay positive despite the fact that her family has neglected her. At just five years old, Matilda learns to live by herself; cooking and cleaning without any help from her family. Although a five year old providing for his or herself is wrong and meant to be sympathized, the audience can't help but adore Matilda's charisma and innocence in what should be a sad and somber situation. When Matilda's burning desire to learn finally convinces her dad to enroll her in school, she meets many people that actually care about her. Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, and all of her classmates are amazed at the amount of knowledge she already has at such a young age. On top of being the smartest in her class, Matilda is also well-liked by her peers. It is encouraging for the audience to see Matilda finally getting the attention she lacks at home. At school, Matilda's best friends, Lavender and Hortensia, constantly urge her to use her secret telekinetic powers. When the evil principal, Miss Trunchbull, came to Miss Honey's class one day, Matilda used her telekinetic powers to spill Miss Trunchbull's water glass everywhere to make her leave the room. By giving Matilda fictional telekinetic powers, it creates a sense of magic that both young and old audiences can relate to. Amongst the trouble that Matilda goes through at home, the magical powers she has can be seen as a symbol of strength. One of the main reasons that this movie is outstanding is because it's not only adult-friendly, but it's also kid-friendly. The plot is a perfect combination of serious and humorous events. The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.

    Adversity serves as the mother of invention for the characters in director Danny Devito's "Matilda," imaginative juvenile fantasy inspired by British author Roald Dahl bestseller. Previously, Hollywood tapped another Dahl effort "James and the Giant Peach" that met with indifferent box office results. The best rendering thus far of a Dahl tale was "The Witches" (1990) where a little boy is turned into a mouse by a local coven. Although aimed at an adolescent audience, "Matilda" emerges as a tolerably sticky gray (just short of black comedy whose rich visual style provides something for adults to savor. Distorted lens and low-angle photography give this yarn an optical sophistication that older audiences will appreciate and a carnival atmosphere that will delight younger audiences. Devito appears to be imitating Terry Gilliam's bizarre film fantasies like "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys." Aside from the title heroine and her peers, the adult characters are not only warped but downright freakish. What could have been a depressing tale about a neglected and unwanted little girl takes on an upbeat mischievous quality. The filmmakers suggest that the younger you are the better, and that adulthood sabotages the joys of adolescence. As the film unfolds, Harry Wormwood (Danny Devito of "Batman Returns") takes one look at his newborn baby daughter, screws his face up in disgust, and walks out. Wormwood is a sleazy, low-life, miser who sells junk autos at sky rocket prices and traffics in purloined car parts. The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents. While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set. Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme. If the obnoxious Wormwoods and Ms. Trunchbull represent hideous extroverts, then Miss Honey epitomizes the humble introvert. Clearly, "Matilda" endorses the latter behavior. The only good adults are the docile adults. Mara Wilson steals the show as the eponymous protagonist. You may remember Mara from the Robin Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire." If you adore her saccharine personality in that movie, you will love "Matilda." Arguably, "Matilda" falls short of being a classic because both the character of Matilda and actress Mara Wilson are far too cute to be credible. Funny and inventive as it is at times, "Matilda" never escapes its repressively formulaic origins. Children will obviously have more fun at "Matilda" than adults.

    Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender. True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British "Headmistress" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American "Principal". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it. But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant. In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian  where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

    Story of a girl, story of life. Matilda, Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey,... Names that will remain in my head forever. Matilda was my childhood favorite movie. When I was 12, I watched it almost everyday, mostly at the school's video club during lunch times, till I turned 15. I love this movie because it is entertaining, touching, funny, the dialogues are convincing, actors are playing their roles with great success and the music from David Newman that perfectly fits to the movie is just beautiful and pleasant to listen to. I read the book many times and this movie is one of the rarest production that preserves the story and the atmosphere from the book. Of course, some details and scenes from the book have voluntary been cut or re-adapted but these changes doesn't affect on the magic of the writing. Mara Wilson is a great actress on it. Her leading role as a kid suffering from misunderstanding by her family, leading her to use later on her "special ability" to gain respect from her surrounding or bring some justice back is just perfect. When I was a kid, this movie touched me because I identified myself to Matilda. After parent's divorce, my childhood life was the same as Matilda's: parents looked upon me as nothing more as a scab and I had some nasty teachers. The movie helped me a lot to keep some happiness. I am 24 right now, and I decided to watch it again. It's the only movie in the world in which I can spend hours watching in a row in circle like a kid without feeling bored. And watching it one time is enough to bring some joy of living for a few days. My future kids will love it. This movie is universal for a whole generation, even if unfortunately, it's not very famous. It deserves to be because it's a lesson for kids and parents about life. But I spread this beautiful piece of art amongst my friends and they all enjoyed it. It deserves a bluray adaptation.

    This Outstanding film is a great way to get a family including young children to spend quality time together. Not only is it comical for all ages, it teaches young children valuable life lessons. I've watched it time and time again to the point I can mouth the words, yet it never gets old. It's full of joy and laughter as an ordinary young girl discovers she isn't like her friends at school. It's a great film to chill out and bring back the child in you. Although its a children's film, it can make you think in ways you wouldn't of previously done. It uses catchy phrases to make your mind wonder. Once watching it the first time, you Will be edging to watch it again or buy it on DVD whilst children will be nagging for it to Be On. It's one of the most memorable films I've seen, and I highly recommend it to viewers of all ages.

    This is certainly not a comedy, nor a family movie, it is actually against the family. I would easily compare this to An American Crime (2007) movie. Filmmakers understate and trying to make funny a vy sad situation of a girl born to an egoistic and dysfunctional family with a crook bad tempered father, self centered mother and a bully brother where no one cares about one another. How can someone say that psychologically abused children should watch this movie, it would only reopened their wounds and would have to take more antidepressants then before and watching that crazy monster headmistress throwing kids around or chasing them in that dark filthy house full of chambers of horror. Common, this is not a family or comedy movie. And the last scene, where they easily signed the adoption forms and got rid of their daughter was so hard to watch that any child watching this would get the whole life trauma and would have nightmares long after. And that nauseous scene where the fat boy is punished by eating the whole cake, and ... and ... But maybe it is just me, I don't know.

    The movie was super scary even for my 8 year old. She cried and almost felt sick because it was very gory. Advisable to watch with a parent that can explain to kids that movies are not real. My daughter watched this at school, and quite a few kids had to leave the auditorium. She did mention that there were some funny parts but the plot was very scary to her. I think that i may eventually watch this again with my kids a few years from now. I think the minimum age should be 10 years old, but i guess it depends on the kid. On another note, my 6 year old little man, did not find it too scary. We are writing this review by her urging, because she is concerned that other kids will watch it and feel like she did. So she just wants to warn everyone!!!

The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents. While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set. Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme. If the obnoxious Wormwoods and Ms. Trunchbull represent hideous extroverts, then Miss Honey epitomizes the humble introvert. Clearly, "Matilda" endorses the latter behavior. The only good adults are the docile adults. Mara Wilson steals the show as the eponymous protagonist. You may remember Mara from the Robin Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire." If you adore her saccharine personality in that movie, you will love "Matilda." Arguably, "Matilda" falls short of being a classic because both the character of Matilda and actress Mara Wilson are far too cute to be credible. Funny and inventive as it is at times, "Matilda" never escapes its repressively formulaic origins. Children will obviously have more fun at "Matilda" than adults.

    Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender. True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British "Headmistress" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American "Principal". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it. But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant. In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian  where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

    Story of a girl, story of life. Matilda, Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey,... Names that will remain in my head forever. Matilda was my childhood favorite movie. When I was 12, I watched it almost everyday, mostly at the school's video club during lunch times, till I turned 15. I love this movie because it is entertaining, touching, funny, the dialogues are convincing, actors are playing their roles with great success and the music from David Newman that perfectly fits to the movie is just beautiful and pleasant to listen to. I read the book many times and this movie is one of the rarest production that preserves the story and the atmosphere from the book. Of course, some details and scenes from the book have voluntary been cut or re-adapted but these changes doesn't affect on the magic of the writing. Mara Wilson is a great actress on it. Her leading role as a kid suffering from misunderstanding by her family, leading her to use later on her "special ability" to gain respect from her surrounding or bring some justice back is just perfect. When I was a kid, this movie touched me because I identified myself to Matilda. After parent's divorce, my childhood life was the same as Matilda's: parents looked upon me as nothing more as a scab and I had some nasty teachers. The movie helped me a lot to keep some happiness. I am 24 right now, and I decided to watch it again. It's the only movie in the world in which I can spend hours watching in a row in circle like a kid without feeling bored. And watching it one time is enough to bring some joy of living for a few days. My future kids will love it. This movie is universal for a whole generation, even if unfortunately, it's not very famous. It deserves to be because it's a lesson for kids and parents about life. But I spread this beautiful piece of art amongst my friends and they all enjoyed it. It deserves a bluray adaptation.

    This Outstanding film is a great way to get a family including young children to spend quality time together. Not only is it comical for all ages, it teaches young children valuable life lessons. I've watched it time and time again to the point I can mouth the words, yet it never gets old. It's full of joy and laughter as an ordinary young girl discovers she isn't like her friends at school. It's a great film to chill out and bring back the child in you. Although its a children's film, it can make you think in ways you wouldn't of previously done. It uses catchy phrases to make your mind wonder. Once watching it the first time, you Will be edging to watch it again or buy it on DVD whilst children will be nagging for it to Be On. It's one of the most memorable films I've seen, and I highly recommend it to viewers of all ages.

    This is certainly not a comedy, nor a family movie, it is actually against the family. I would easily compare this to An American Crime (2007) movie. Filmmakers understate and trying to make funny a vy sad situation of a girl born to an egoistic and dysfunctional family with a crook bad tempered father, self centered mother and a bully brother where no one cares about one another. How can someone say that psychologically abused children should watch this movie, it would only reopened their wounds and would have to take more antidepressants then before and watching that crazy monster headmistress throwing kids around or chasing them in that dark filthy house full of chambers of horror. Common, this is not a family or comedy movie. And the last scene, where they easily signed the adoption forms and got rid of their daughter was so hard to watch that any child watching this would get the whole life trauma and would have nightmares long after. And that nauseous scene where the fat boy is punished by eating the whole cake, and ... and ... But maybe it is just me, I don't know.

    The movie was super scary even for my 8 year old. She cried and almost felt sick because it was very gory. Advisable to watch with a parent that can explain to kids that movies are not real. My daughter watched this at school, and quite a few kids had to leave the auditorium. She did mention that there were some funny parts but the plot was very scary to her. I think that i may eventually watch this again with my kids a few years from now. I think the minimum age should be 10 years old, but i guess it depends on the kid. On another note, my 6 year old little man, did not find it too scary. We are writing this review by her urging, because she is concerned that other kids will watch it and feel like she did. So she just wants to warn everyone!!!

    In Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl addressed the problems adults face when they must deal with bratty children. In Matilda, he addresses the troubles a sweet child faces when she must deal with problem adults. I was surprised this adorable movie was not receiving better ratings, so I read the reviews of the people who hated it. One wonders what the moral was. Of course, not every children's movie has a moral. What's the moral of Harry Potter or Goonies? But this one has an obvious moral. Are there not bullies in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Are there not kind people in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Beyond morals, there's an important message. The movie tells mistreated children, in more ways than one: "you are not alone". For those wondering why Dahl did not create a dark, depressing, hopeless story for children surviving in bad homes, rather than a funny comedy, I suspect it's because the children facing such struggles don't need more darkness and hopelessness in their lives. Sure, it's a dark comedy, but that's the only way to reach such children about their problems and still bring them an uplifting movie. What's so bad about a dark comedy? Research shows that a child's quality of life is directly correlated to their mother's IQ. Most abusive and neglectful parents are simply idiots. Do mistreated children exist in this country? Ask CPS. Why should all children's movies ignore this fact? There was a time when everyone just ignored the problem completely, because it made adults that uncomfortable to deal with what was actually happening to children, but I'd rather move forward than backwards. To make matters worse, the brighter a child is, the greater his risk of abuse by jealous, stupid parents. Abraham Maslow had an IQ of 195. When he was a child, his abusive mother discovered some kittens he'd rescued and killed the kittens by beating their heads against a wall. He had many moments of despair during his childhood, and surely would have appreciated a movie like this. Being forced to care for one's self and cope so early no doubt forces kids to grow up quickly. True, many mistreated children might just be intellectually average kids who, unfortunately for them, happen to have stupid parents, so perhaps Dahl should have worried about inflating those kids' egos. There is a genius kid in the new Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but none of the reviewers are pouring venom about it. Is it just because Matilda's a girl? Heaven forbid kids get the idea that educating themselves might help them solve some of their problems, or that a love of learning is something to be proud of. Harry Potter and Annie are both movies with evil adults, some of whom try to kill the kids, yet the reviewers don't seem confused about why the adults are evil. If every adult you met in your childhood made perfect sense, was smarter than you, and never subjected you to mistreatment due to their own insecurities, then good for you. This movie is not for you. It's for the rest of us. I commend the creators of this movie for having the guts to reach out to such kids, before their despair drives them to suicide, even if some people say "but my parents were good, so why did you create a movie with bad parents?" Take a look at white trash America. I am also thrilled it was turned into a Broadway musical. Obviously, some people get it.

    The 1996 film, Matilda, has been a classic ever since it was released. This movie is one of my personal favorites due to its humorous yet touching plot. If you're looking for the perfect film to watch with your family all snuggled up with a bag of popcorn, this movie is for you. Due to its appeal to both young and old audiences, this movie is hard to criticize. While most of the movie is light-hearted due to Matilda's charming innocence amongst the negativity around her, other parts of the movie exhibit heart-wrenching situations that a kid shouldn't have to endure, efficiently teaching genuine life lessons about the importance of family. Matilda, only five years old at the start of the movie, is the youngest person in her family. Her parents barely acknowledge that she's alive by constantly favoring their older son, Michael, and disregarding anything that Matilda says. The audience is immediately attracted to Matilda's polite charm and ability to stay positive despite the fact that her family has neglected her. At just five years old, Matilda learns to live by herself; cooking and cleaning without any help from her family. Although a five year old providing for his or herself is wrong and meant to be sympathized, the audience can't help but adore Matilda's charisma and innocence in what should be a sad and somber situation. When Matilda's burning desire to learn finally convinces her dad to enroll her in school, she meets many people that actually care about her. Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, and all of her classmates are amazed at the amount of knowledge she already has at such a young age. On top of being the smartest in her class, Matilda is also well-liked by her peers. It is encouraging for the audience to see Matilda finally getting the attention she lacks at home. At school, Matilda's best friends, Lavender and Hortensia, constantly urge her to use her secret telekinetic powers. When the evil principal, Miss Trunchbull, came to Miss Honey's class one day, Matilda used her telekinetic powers to spill Miss Trunchbull's water glass everywhere to make her leave the room. By giving Matilda fictional telekinetic powers, it creates a sense of magic that both young and old audiences can relate to. Amongst the trouble that Matilda goes through at home, the magical powers she has can be seen as a symbol of strength. One of the main reasons that this movie is outstanding is because it's not only adult-friendly, but it's also kid-friendly. The plot is a perfect combination of serious and humorous events. The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.

    Adversity serves as the mother of invention for the characters in director Danny Devito's "Matilda," imaginative juvenile fantasy inspired by British author Roald Dahl bestseller. Previously, Hollywood tapped another Dahl effort "James and the Giant Peach" that met with indifferent box office results. The best rendering thus far of a Dahl tale was "The Witches" (1990) where a little boy is turned into a mouse by a local coven. Although aimed at an adolescent audience, "Matilda" emerges as a tolerably sticky gray (just short of black comedy whose rich visual style provides something for adults to savor. Distorted lens and low-angle photography give this yarn an optical sophistication that older audiences will appreciate and a carnival atmosphere that will delight younger audiences. Devito appears to be imitating Terry Gilliam's bizarre film fantasies like "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys." Aside from the title heroine and her peers, the adult characters are not only warped but downright freakish. What could have been a depressing tale about a neglected and unwanted little girl takes on an upbeat mischievous quality. The filmmakers suggest that the younger you are the better, and that adulthood sabotages the joys of adolescence. As the film unfolds, Harry Wormwood (Danny Devito of "Batman Returns") takes one look at his newborn baby daughter, screws his face up in disgust, and walks out. Wormwood is a sleazy, low-life, miser who sells junk autos at sky rocket prices and traffics in purloined car parts. The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents. While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set. Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme.

Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian  where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

    Story of a girl, story of life. Matilda, Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey,... Names that will remain in my head forever. Matilda was my childhood favorite movie. When I was 12, I watched it almost everyday, mostly at the school's video club during lunch times, till I turned 15. I love this movie because it is entertaining, touching, funny, the dialogues are convincing, actors are playing their roles with great success and the music from David Newman that perfectly fits to the movie is just beautiful and pleasant to listen to. I read the book many times and this movie is one of the rarest production that preserves the story and the atmosphere from the book. Of course, some details and scenes from the book have voluntary been cut or re-adapted but these changes doesn't affect on the magic of the writing. Mara Wilson is a great actress on it. Her leading role as a kid suffering from misunderstanding by her family, leading her to use later on her "special ability" to gain respect from her surrounding or bring some justice back is just perfect. When I was a kid, this movie touched me because I identified myself to Matilda. After parent's divorce, my childhood life was the same as Matilda's: parents looked upon me as nothing more as a scab and I had some nasty teachers. The movie helped me a lot to keep some happiness. I am 24 right now, and I decided to watch it again. It's the only movie in the world in which I can spend hours watching in a row in circle like a kid without feeling bored. And watching it one time is enough to bring some joy of living for a few days. My future kids will love it. This movie is universal for a whole generation, even if unfortunately, it's not very famous. It deserves to be because it's a lesson for kids and parents about life. But I spread this beautiful piece of art amongst my friends and they all enjoyed it. It deserves a bluray adaptation.

    This Outstanding film is a great way to get a family including young children to spend quality time together. Not only is it comical for all ages, it teaches young children valuable life lessons. I've watched it time and time again to the point I can mouth the words, yet it never gets old. It's full of joy and laughter as an ordinary young girl discovers she isn't like her friends at school. It's a great film to chill out and bring back the child in you. Although its a children's film, it can make you think in ways you wouldn't of previously done. It uses catchy phrases to make your mind wonder. Once watching it the first time, you Will be edging to watch it again or buy it on DVD whilst children will be nagging for it to Be On. It's one of the most memorable films I've seen, and I highly recommend it to viewers of all ages.

    This is certainly not a comedy, nor a family movie, it is actually against the family. I would easily compare this to An American Crime (2007) movie. Filmmakers understate and trying to make funny a vy sad situation of a girl born to an egoistic and dysfunctional family with a crook bad tempered father, self centered mother and a bully brother where no one cares about one another. How can someone say that psychologically abused children should watch this movie, it would only reopened their wounds and would have to take more antidepressants then before and watching that crazy monster headmistress throwing kids around or chasing them in that dark filthy house full of chambers of horror. Common, this is not a family or comedy movie. And the last scene, where they easily signed the adoption forms and got rid of their daughter was so hard to watch that any child watching this would get the whole life trauma and would have nightmares long after. And that nauseous scene where the fat boy is punished by eating the whole cake, and ... and ... But maybe it is just me, I don't know.

    The movie was super scary even for my 8 year old. She cried and almost felt sick because it was very gory. Advisable to watch with a parent that can explain to kids that movies are not real. My daughter watched this at school, and quite a few kids had to leave the auditorium. She did mention that there were some funny parts but the plot was very scary to her. I think that i may eventually watch this again with my kids a few years from now. I think the minimum age should be 10 years old, but i guess it depends on the kid. On another note, my 6 year old little man, did not find it too scary. We are writing this review by her urging, because she is concerned that other kids will watch it and feel like she did. So she just wants to warn everyone!!!

    In Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl addressed the problems adults face when they must deal with bratty children. In Matilda, he addresses the troubles a sweet child faces when she must deal with problem adults. I was surprised this adorable movie was not receiving better ratings, so I read the reviews of the people who hated it. One wonders what the moral was. Of course, not every children's movie has a moral. What's the moral of Harry Potter or Goonies? But this one has an obvious moral. Are there not bullies in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Are there not kind people in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Beyond morals, there's an important message. The movie tells mistreated children, in more ways than one: "you are not alone". For those wondering why Dahl did not create a dark, depressing, hopeless story for children surviving in bad homes, rather than a funny comedy, I suspect it's because the children facing such struggles don't need more darkness and hopelessness in their lives. Sure, it's a dark comedy, but that's the only way to reach such children about their problems and still bring them an uplifting movie. What's so bad about a dark comedy? Research shows that a child's quality of life is directly correlated to their mother's IQ. Most abusive and neglectful parents are simply idiots. Do mistreated children exist in this country? Ask CPS. Why should all children's movies ignore this fact? There was a time when everyone just ignored the problem completely, because it made adults that uncomfortable to deal with what was actually happening to children, but I'd rather move forward than backwards. To make matters worse, the brighter a child is, the greater his risk of abuse by jealous, stupid parents. Abraham Maslow had an IQ of 195. When he was a child, his abusive mother discovered some kittens he'd rescued and killed the kittens by beating their heads against a wall. He had many moments of despair during his childhood, and surely would have appreciated a movie like this. Being forced to care for one's self and cope so early no doubt forces kids to grow up quickly. True, many mistreated children might just be intellectually average kids who, unfortunately for them, happen to have stupid parents, so perhaps Dahl should have worried about inflating those kids' egos. There is a genius kid in the new Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but none of the reviewers are pouring venom about it. Is it just because Matilda's a girl? Heaven forbid kids get the idea that educating themselves might help them solve some of their problems, or that a love of learning is something to be proud of. Harry Potter and Annie are both movies with evil adults, some of whom try to kill the kids, yet the reviewers don't seem confused about why the adults are evil. If every adult you met in your childhood made perfect sense, was smarter than you, and never subjected you to mistreatment due to their own insecurities, then good for you. This movie is not for you. It's for the rest of us. I commend the creators of this movie for having the guts to reach out to such kids, before their despair drives them to suicide, even if some people say "but my parents were good, so why did you create a movie with bad parents?" Take a look at white trash America. I am also thrilled it was turned into a Broadway musical. Obviously, some people get it.

    The 1996 film, Matilda, has been a classic ever since it was released. This movie is one of my personal favorites due to its humorous yet touching plot. If you're looking for the perfect film to watch with your family all snuggled up with a bag of popcorn, this movie is for you. Due to its appeal to both young and old audiences, this movie is hard to criticize. While most of the movie is light-hearted due to Matilda's charming innocence amongst the negativity around her, other parts of the movie exhibit heart-wrenching situations that a kid shouldn't have to endure, efficiently teaching genuine life lessons about the importance of family. Matilda, only five years old at the start of the movie, is the youngest person in her family. Her parents barely acknowledge that she's alive by constantly favoring their older son, Michael, and disregarding anything that Matilda says. The audience is immediately attracted to Matilda's polite charm and ability to stay positive despite the fact that her family has neglected her. At just five years old, Matilda learns to live by herself; cooking and cleaning without any help from her family. Although a five year old providing for his or herself is wrong and meant to be sympathized, the audience can't help but adore Matilda's charisma and innocence in what should be a sad and somber situation. When Matilda's burning desire to learn finally convinces her dad to enroll her in school, she meets many people that actually care about her. Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, and all of her classmates are amazed at the amount of knowledge she already has at such a young age. On top of being the smartest in her class, Matilda is also well-liked by her peers. It is encouraging for the audience to see Matilda finally getting the attention she lacks at home. At school, Matilda's best friends, Lavender and Hortensia, constantly urge her to use her secret telekinetic powers. When the evil principal, Miss Trunchbull, came to Miss Honey's class one day, Matilda used her telekinetic powers to spill Miss Trunchbull's water glass everywhere to make her leave the room. By giving Matilda fictional telekinetic powers, it creates a sense of magic that both young and old audiences can relate to. Amongst the trouble that Matilda goes through at home, the magical powers she has can be seen as a symbol of strength. One of the main reasons that this movie is outstanding is because it's not only adult-friendly, but it's also kid-friendly. The plot is a perfect combination of serious and humorous events. The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.

    Adversity serves as the mother of invention for the characters in director Danny Devito's "Matilda," imaginative juvenile fantasy inspired by British author Roald Dahl bestseller. Previously, Hollywood tapped another Dahl effort "James and the Giant Peach" that met with indifferent box office results. The best rendering thus far of a Dahl tale was "The Witches" (1990) where a little boy is turned into a mouse by a local coven. Although aimed at an adolescent audience, "Matilda" emerges as a tolerably sticky gray (just short of black comedy whose rich visual style provides something for adults to savor. Distorted lens and low-angle photography give this yarn an optical sophistication that older audiences will appreciate and a carnival atmosphere that will delight younger audiences. Devito appears to be imitating Terry Gilliam's bizarre film fantasies like "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys." Aside from the title heroine and her peers, the adult characters are not only warped but downright freakish. What could have been a depressing tale about a neglected and unwanted little girl takes on an upbeat mischievous quality. The filmmakers suggest that the younger you are the better, and that adulthood sabotages the joys of adolescence. As the film unfolds, Harry Wormwood (Danny Devito of "Batman Returns") takes one look at his newborn baby daughter, screws his face up in disgust, and walks out. Wormwood is a sleazy, low-life, miser who sells junk autos at sky rocket prices and traffics in purloined car parts. The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents. While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set. Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme. If the obnoxious Wormwoods and Ms. Trunchbull represent hideous extroverts, then Miss Honey epitomizes the humble introvert. Clearly, "Matilda" endorses the latter behavior. The only good adults are the docile adults. Mara Wilson steals the show as the eponymous protagonist. You may remember Mara from the Robin Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire." If you adore her saccharine personality in that movie, you will love "Matilda." Arguably, "Matilda" falls short of being a classic because both the character of Matilda and actress Mara Wilson are far too cute to be credible. Funny and inventive as it is at times, "Matilda" never escapes its repressively formulaic origins. Children will obviously have more fun at "Matilda" than adults.

    Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender. True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British "Headmistress" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American "Principal". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it. But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant. In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian  where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

I think that i may eventually watch this again with my kids a few years from now. I think the minimum age should be 10 years old, but i guess it depends on the kid. On another note, my 6 year old little man, did not find it too scary. We are writing this review by her urging, because she is concerned that other kids will watch it and feel like she did. So she just wants to warn everyone!!!

    In Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl addressed the problems adults face when they must deal with bratty children. In Matilda, he addresses the troubles a sweet child faces when she must deal with problem adults. I was surprised this adorable movie was not receiving better ratings, so I read the reviews of the people who hated it. One wonders what the moral was. Of course, not every children's movie has a moral. What's the moral of Harry Potter or Goonies? But this one has an obvious moral. Are there not bullies in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Are there not kind people in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Beyond morals, there's an important message. The movie tells mistreated children, in more ways than one: "you are not alone". For those wondering why Dahl did not create a dark, depressing, hopeless story for children surviving in bad homes, rather than a funny comedy, I suspect it's because the children facing such struggles don't need more darkness and hopelessness in their lives. Sure, it's a dark comedy, but that's the only way to reach such children about their problems and still bring them an uplifting movie. What's so bad about a dark comedy? Research shows that a child's quality of life is directly correlated to their mother's IQ. Most abusive and neglectful parents are simply idiots. Do mistreated children exist in this country? Ask CPS. Why should all children's movies ignore this fact? There was a time when everyone just ignored the problem completely, because it made adults that uncomfortable to deal with what was actually happening to children, but I'd rather move forward than backwards. To make matters worse, the brighter a child is, the greater his risk of abuse by jealous, stupid parents. Abraham Maslow had an IQ of 195. When he was a child, his abusive mother discovered some kittens he'd rescued and killed the kittens by beating their heads against a wall. He had many moments of despair during his childhood, and surely would have appreciated a movie like this. Being forced to care for one's self and cope so early no doubt forces kids to grow up quickly. True, many mistreated children might just be intellectually average kids who, unfortunately for them, happen to have stupid parents, so perhaps Dahl should have worried about inflating those kids' egos. There is a genius kid in the new Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but none of the reviewers are pouring venom about it. Is it just because Matilda's a girl? Heaven forbid kids get the idea that educating themselves might help them solve some of their problems, or that a love of learning is something to be proud of. Harry Potter and Annie are both movies with evil adults, some of whom try to kill the kids, yet the reviewers don't seem confused about why the adults are evil. If every adult you met in your childhood made perfect sense, was smarter than you, and never subjected you to mistreatment due to their own insecurities, then good for you. This movie is not for you. It's for the rest of us. I commend the creators of this movie for having the guts to reach out to such kids, before their despair drives them to suicide, even if some people say "but my parents were good, so why did you create a movie with bad parents?" Take a look at white trash America. I am also thrilled it was turned into a Broadway musical. Obviously, some people get it.

    The 1996 film, Matilda, has been a classic ever since it was released. This movie is one of my personal favorites due to its humorous yet touching plot. If you're looking for the perfect film to watch with your family all snuggled up with a bag of popcorn, this movie is for you. Due to its appeal to both young and old audiences, this movie is hard to criticize. While most of the movie is light-hearted due to Matilda's charming innocence amongst the negativity around her, other parts of the movie exhibit heart-wrenching situations that a kid shouldn't have to endure, efficiently teaching genuine life lessons about the importance of family. Matilda, only five years old at the start of the movie, is the youngest person in her family. Her parents barely acknowledge that she's alive by constantly favoring their older son, Michael, and disregarding anything that Matilda says. The audience is immediately attracted to Matilda's polite charm and ability to stay positive despite the fact that her family has neglected her. At just five years old, Matilda learns to live by herself; cooking and cleaning without any help from her family. Although a five year old providing for his or herself is wrong and meant to be sympathized, the audience can't help but adore Matilda's charisma and innocence in what should be a sad and somber situation. When Matilda's burning desire to learn finally convinces her dad to enroll her in school, she meets many people that actually care about her. Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, and all of her classmates are amazed at the amount of knowledge she already has at such a young age. On top of being the smartest in her class, Matilda is also well-liked by her peers. It is encouraging for the audience to see Matilda finally getting the attention she lacks at home. At school, Matilda's best friends, Lavender and Hortensia, constantly urge her to use her secret telekinetic powers. When the evil principal, Miss Trunchbull, came to Miss Honey's class one day, Matilda used her telekinetic powers to spill Miss Trunchbull's water glass everywhere to make her leave the room. By giving Matilda fictional telekinetic powers, it creates a sense of magic that both young and old audiences can relate to. Amongst the trouble that Matilda goes through at home, the magical powers she has can be seen as a symbol of strength. One of the main reasons that this movie is outstanding is because it's not only adult-friendly, but it's also kid-friendly. The plot is a perfect combination of serious and humorous events. The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.

    Adversity serves as the mother of invention for the characters in director Danny Devito's "Matilda," imaginative juvenile fantasy inspired by British author Roald Dahl bestseller. Previously, Hollywood tapped another Dahl effort "James and the Giant Peach" that met with indifferent box office results. The best rendering thus far of a Dahl tale was "The Witches" (1990) where a little boy is turned into a mouse by a local coven. Although aimed at an adolescent audience, "Matilda" emerges as a tolerably sticky gray (just short of black comedy whose rich visual style provides something for adults to savor. Distorted lens and low-angle photography give this yarn an optical sophistication that older audiences will appreciate and a carnival atmosphere that will delight younger audiences. Devito appears to be imitating Terry Gilliam's bizarre film fantasies like "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys." Aside from the title heroine and her peers, the adult characters are not only warped but downright freakish. What could have been a depressing tale about a neglected and unwanted little girl takes on an upbeat mischievous quality. The filmmakers suggest that the younger you are the better, and that adulthood sabotages the joys of adolescence. As the film unfolds, Harry Wormwood (Danny Devito of "Batman Returns") takes one look at his newborn baby daughter, screws his face up in disgust, and walks out. Wormwood is a sleazy, low-life, miser who sells junk autos at sky rocket prices and traffics in purloined car parts. The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents. While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set. Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme. If the obnoxious Wormwoods and Ms. Trunchbull represent hideous extroverts, then Miss Honey epitomizes the humble introvert. Clearly, "Matilda" endorses the latter behavior. The only good adults are the docile adults. Mara Wilson steals the show as the eponymous protagonist. You may remember Mara from the Robin Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire." If you adore her saccharine personality in that movie, you will love "Matilda." Arguably, "Matilda" falls short of being a classic because both the character of Matilda and actress Mara Wilson are far too cute to be credible. Funny and inventive as it is at times, "Matilda" never escapes its repressively formulaic origins. Children will obviously have more fun at "Matilda" than adults.

    Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender. True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British "Headmistress" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American "Principal". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it. But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant. In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian  where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

    Story of a girl, story of life. Matilda, Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey,... Names that will remain in my head forever. Matilda was my childhood favorite movie. When I was 12, I watched it almost everyday, mostly at the school's video club during lunch times, till I turned 15. I love this movie because it is entertaining, touching, funny, the dialogues are convincing, actors are playing their roles with great success and the music from David Newman that perfectly fits to the movie is just beautiful and pleasant to listen to. I read the book many times and this movie is one of the rarest production that preserves the story and the atmosphere from the book. Of course, some details and scenes from the book have voluntary been cut or re-adapted but these changes doesn't affect on the magic of the writing. Mara Wilson is a great actress on it. Her leading role as a kid suffering from misunderstanding by her family, leading her to use later on her "special ability" to gain respect from her surrounding or bring some justice back is just perfect. When I was a kid, this movie touched me because I identified myself to Matilda. After parent's divorce, my childhood life was the same as Matilda's: parents looked upon me as nothing more as a scab and I had some nasty teachers. The movie helped me a lot to keep some happiness. I am 24 right now, and I decided to watch it again. It's the only movie in the world in which I can spend hours watching in a row in circle like a kid without feeling bored. And watching it one time is enough to bring some joy of living for a few days. My future kids will love it. This movie is universal for a whole generation, even if unfortunately, it's not very famous. It deserves to be because it's a lesson for kids and parents about life. But I spread this beautiful piece of art amongst my friends and they all enjoyed it. It deserves a bluray adaptation.

    This Outstanding film is a great way to get a family including young children to spend quality time together. Not only is it comical for all ages, it teaches young children valuable life lessons. I've watched it time and time again to the point I can mouth the words, yet it never gets old. It's full of joy and laughter as an ordinary young girl discovers she isn't like her friends at school. It's a great film to chill out and bring back the child in you. Although its a children's film, it can make you think in ways you wouldn't of previously done. It uses catchy phrases to make your mind wonder. Once watching it the first time, you Will be edging to watch it again or buy it on DVD whilst children will be nagging for it to Be On. It's one of the most memorable films I've seen, and I highly recommend it to viewers of all ages.

    This is certainly not a comedy, nor a family movie, it is actually against the family. I would easily compare this to An American Crime (2007) movie. Filmmakers understate and trying to make funny a vy sad situation of a girl born to an egoistic and dysfunctional family with a crook bad tempered father, self centered mother and a bully brother where no one cares about one another. How can someone say that psychologically abused children should watch this movie, it would only reopened their wounds and would have to take more antidepressants then before and watching that crazy monster headmistress throwing kids around or chasing them in that dark filthy house full of chambers of horror. Common, this is not a family or comedy movie. And the last scene, where they easily signed the adoption forms and got rid of their daughter was so hard to watch that any child watching this would get the whole life trauma and would have nightmares long after. And that nauseous scene where the fat boy is punished by eating the whole cake, and ... and ... But maybe it is just me, I don't know.

The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.

    Adversity serves as the mother of invention for the characters in director Danny Devito's "Matilda," imaginative juvenile fantasy inspired by British author Roald Dahl bestseller. Previously, Hollywood tapped another Dahl effort "James and the Giant Peach" that met with indifferent box office results. The best rendering thus far of a Dahl tale was "The Witches" (1990) where a little boy is turned into a mouse by a local coven. Although aimed at an adolescent audience, "Matilda" emerges as a tolerably sticky gray (just short of black comedy whose rich visual style provides something for adults to savor. Distorted lens and low-angle photography give this yarn an optical sophistication that older audiences will appreciate and a carnival atmosphere that will delight younger audiences. Devito appears to be imitating Terry Gilliam's bizarre film fantasies like "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys." Aside from the title heroine and her peers, the adult characters are not only warped but downright freakish. What could have been a depressing tale about a neglected and unwanted little girl takes on an upbeat mischievous quality. The filmmakers suggest that the younger you are the better, and that adulthood sabotages the joys of adolescence. As the film unfolds, Harry Wormwood (Danny Devito of "Batman Returns") takes one look at his newborn baby daughter, screws his face up in disgust, and walks out. Wormwood is a sleazy, low-life, miser who sells junk autos at sky rocket prices and traffics in purloined car parts. The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents. While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set. Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme. If the obnoxious Wormwoods and Ms. Trunchbull represent hideous extroverts, then Miss Honey epitomizes the humble introvert. Clearly, "Matilda" endorses the latter behavior. The only good adults are the docile adults. Mara Wilson steals the show as the eponymous protagonist. You may remember Mara from the Robin Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire." If you adore her saccharine personality in that movie, you will love "Matilda." Arguably, "Matilda" falls short of being a classic because both the character of Matilda and actress Mara Wilson are far too cute to be credible. Funny and inventive as it is at times, "Matilda" never escapes its repressively formulaic origins. Children will obviously have more fun at "Matilda" than adults.

    Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender. True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British "Headmistress" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American "Principal". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it. But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant. In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian  where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

    Story of a girl, story of life. Matilda, Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey,... Names that will remain in my head forever. Matilda was my childhood favorite movie. When I was 12, I watched it almost everyday, mostly at the school's video club during lunch times, till I turned 15. I love this movie because it is entertaining, touching, funny, the dialogues are convincing, actors are playing their roles with great success and the music from David Newman that perfectly fits to the movie is just beautiful and pleasant to listen to. I read the book many times and this movie is one of the rarest production that preserves the story and the atmosphere from the book. Of course, some details and scenes from the book have voluntary been cut or re-adapted but these changes doesn't affect on the magic of the writing. Mara Wilson is a great actress on it. Her leading role as a kid suffering from misunderstanding by her family, leading her to use later on her "special ability" to gain respect from her surrounding or bring some justice back is just perfect. When I was a kid, this movie touched me because I identified myself to Matilda. After parent's divorce, my childhood life was the same as Matilda's: parents looked upon me as nothing more as a scab and I had some nasty teachers. The movie helped me a lot to keep some happiness. I am 24 right now, and I decided to watch it again. It's the only movie in the world in which I can spend hours watching in a row in circle like a kid without feeling bored. And watching it one time is enough to bring some joy of living for a few days. My future kids will love it. This movie is universal for a whole generation, even if unfortunately, it's not very famous. It deserves to be because it's a lesson for kids and parents about life. But I spread this beautiful piece of art amongst my friends and they all enjoyed it. It deserves a bluray adaptation.

    This Outstanding film is a great way to get a family including young children to spend quality time together. Not only is it comical for all ages, it teaches young children valuable life lessons. I've watched it time and time again to the point I can mouth the words, yet it never gets old. It's full of joy and laughter as an ordinary young girl discovers she isn't like her friends at school. It's a great film to chill out and bring back the child in you. Although its a children's film, it can make you think in ways you wouldn't of previously done. It uses catchy phrases to make your mind wonder. Once watching it the first time, you Will be edging to watch it again or buy it on DVD whilst children will be nagging for it to Be On. It's one of the most memorable films I've seen, and I highly recommend it to viewers of all ages.

    This is certainly not a comedy, nor a family movie, it is actually against the family. I would easily compare this to An American Crime (2007) movie. Filmmakers understate and trying to make funny a vy sad situation of a girl born to an egoistic and dysfunctional family with a crook bad tempered father, self centered mother and a bully brother where no one cares about one another. How can someone say that psychologically abused children should watch this movie, it would only reopened their wounds and would have to take more antidepressants then before and watching that crazy monster headmistress throwing kids around or chasing them in that dark filthy house full of chambers of horror. Common, this is not a family or comedy movie. And the last scene, where they easily signed the adoption forms and got rid of their daughter was so hard to watch that any child watching this would get the whole life trauma and would have nightmares long after. And that nauseous scene where the fat boy is punished by eating the whole cake, and ... and ... But maybe it is just me, I don't know.

    The movie was super scary even for my 8 year old. She cried and almost felt sick because it was very gory. Advisable to watch with a parent that can explain to kids that movies are not real. My daughter watched this at school, and quite a few kids had to leave the auditorium. She did mention that there were some funny parts but the plot was very scary to her. I think that i may eventually watch this again with my kids a few years from now. I think the minimum age should be 10 years old, but i guess it depends on the kid. On another note, my 6 year old little man, did not find it too scary. We are writing this review by her urging, because she is concerned that other kids will watch it and feel like she did. So she just wants to warn everyone!!!

    In Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl addressed the problems adults face when they must deal with bratty children. In Matilda, he addresses the troubles a sweet child faces when she must deal with problem adults. I was surprised this adorable movie was not receiving better ratings, so I read the reviews of the people who hated it. One wonders what the moral was. Of course, not every children's movie has a moral. What's the moral of Harry Potter or Goonies? But this one has an obvious moral. Are there not bullies in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Are there not kind people in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Beyond morals, there's an important message. The movie tells mistreated children, in more ways than one: "you are not alone". For those wondering why Dahl did not create a dark, depressing, hopeless story for children surviving in bad homes, rather than a funny comedy, I suspect it's because the children facing such struggles don't need more darkness and hopelessness in their lives. Sure, it's a dark comedy, but that's the only way to reach such children about their problems and still bring them an uplifting movie. What's so bad about a dark comedy? Research shows that a child's quality of life is directly correlated to their mother's IQ. Most abusive and neglectful parents are simply idiots. Do mistreated children exist in this country? Ask CPS. Why should all children's movies ignore this fact? There was a time when everyone just ignored the problem completely, because it made adults that uncomfortable to deal with what was actually happening to children, but I'd rather move forward than backwards. To make matters worse, the brighter a child is, the greater his risk of abuse by jealous, stupid parents. Abraham Maslow had an IQ of 195. When he was a child, his abusive mother discovered some kittens he'd rescued and killed the kittens by beating their heads against a wall. He had many moments of despair during his childhood, and surely would have appreciated a movie like this. Being forced to care for one's self and cope so early no doubt forces kids to grow up quickly. True, many mistreated children might just be intellectually average kids who, unfortunately for them, happen to have stupid parents, so perhaps Dahl should have worried about inflating those kids' egos. There is a genius kid in the new Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but none of the reviewers are pouring venom about it. Is it just because Matilda's a girl? Heaven forbid kids get the idea that educating themselves might help them solve some of their problems, or that a love of learning is something to be proud of. Harry Potter and Annie are both movies with evil adults, some of whom try to kill the kids, yet the reviewers don't seem confused about why the adults are evil. If every adult you met in your childhood made perfect sense, was smarter than you, and never subjected you to mistreatment due to their own insecurities, then good for you. This movie is not for you. It's for the rest of us. I commend the creators of this movie for having the guts to reach out to such kids, before their despair drives them to suicide, even if some people say "but my parents were good, so why did you create a movie with bad parents?" Take a look at white trash America. I am also thrilled it was turned into a Broadway musical. Obviously, some people get it.

    The 1996 film, Matilda, has been a classic ever since it was released. This movie is one of my personal favorites due to its humorous yet touching plot. If you're looking for the perfect film to watch with your family all snuggled up with a bag of popcorn, this movie is for you. Due to its appeal to both young and old audiences, this movie is hard to criticize. While most of the movie is light-hearted due to Matilda's charming innocence amongst the negativity around her, other parts of the movie exhibit heart-wrenching situations that a kid shouldn't have to endure, efficiently teaching genuine life lessons about the importance of family. Matilda, only five years old at the start of the movie, is the youngest person in her family. Her parents barely acknowledge that she's alive by constantly favoring their older son, Michael, and disregarding anything that Matilda says. The audience is immediately attracted to Matilda's polite charm and ability to stay positive despite the fact that her family has neglected her. At just five years old, Matilda learns to live by herself; cooking and cleaning without any help from her family. Although a five year old providing for his or herself is wrong and meant to be sympathized, the audience can't help but adore Matilda's charisma and innocence in what should be a sad and somber situation. When Matilda's burning desire to learn finally convinces her dad to enroll her in school, she meets many people that actually care about her. Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, and all of her classmates are amazed at the amount of knowledge she already has at such a young age. On top of being the smartest in her class, Matilda is also well-liked by her peers. It is encouraging for the audience to see Matilda finally getting the attention she lacks at home. At school, Matilda's best friends, Lavender and Hortensia, constantly urge her to use her secret telekinetic powers. When the evil principal, Miss Trunchbull, came to Miss Honey's class one day, Matilda used her telekinetic powers to spill Miss Trunchbull's water glass everywhere to make her leave the room. By giving Matilda fictional telekinetic powers, it creates a sense of magic that both young and old audiences can relate to. Amongst the trouble that Matilda goes through at home, the magical powers she has can be seen as a symbol of strength. One of the main reasons that this movie is outstanding is because it's not only adult-friendly, but it's also kid-friendly. The plot is a perfect combination of serious and humorous events. The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.

True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British "Headmistress" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American "Principal". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it. But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant. In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian  where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

    Story of a girl, story of life. Matilda, Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey,... Names that will remain in my head forever. Matilda was my childhood favorite movie. When I was 12, I watched it almost everyday, mostly at the school's video club during lunch times, till I turned 15. I love this movie because it is entertaining, touching, funny, the dialogues are convincing, actors are playing their roles with great success and the music from David Newman that perfectly fits to the movie is just beautiful and pleasant to listen to. I read the book many times and this movie is one of the rarest production that preserves the story and the atmosphere from the book. Of course, some details and scenes from the book have voluntary been cut or re-adapted but these changes doesn't affect on the magic of the writing. Mara Wilson is a great actress on it. Her leading role as a kid suffering from misunderstanding by her family, leading her to use later on her "special ability" to gain respect from her surrounding or bring some justice back is just perfect. When I was a kid, this movie touched me because I identified myself to Matilda. After parent's divorce, my childhood life was the same as Matilda's: parents looked upon me as nothing more as a scab and I had some nasty teachers. The movie helped me a lot to keep some happiness. I am 24 right now, and I decided to watch it again. It's the only movie in the world in which I can spend hours watching in a row in circle like a kid without feeling bored. And watching it one time is enough to bring some joy of living for a few days. My future kids will love it. This movie is universal for a whole generation, even if unfortunately, it's not very famous. It deserves to be because it's a lesson for kids and parents about life. But I spread this beautiful piece of art amongst my friends and they all enjoyed it. It deserves a bluray adaptation.

    This Outstanding film is a great way to get a family including young children to spend quality time together. Not only is it comical for all ages, it teaches young children valuable life lessons. I've watched it time and time again to the point I can mouth the words, yet it never gets old. It's full of joy and laughter as an ordinary young girl discovers she isn't like her friends at school. It's a great film to chill out and bring back the child in you. Although its a children's film, it can make you think in ways you wouldn't of previously done. It uses catchy phrases to make your mind wonder. Once watching it the first time, you Will be edging to watch it again or buy it on DVD whilst children will be nagging for it to Be On. It's one of the most memorable films I've seen, and I highly recommend it to viewers of all ages.

    This is certainly not a comedy, nor a family movie, it is actually against the family. I would easily compare this to An American Crime (2007) movie. Filmmakers understate and trying to make funny a vy sad situation of a girl born to an egoistic and dysfunctional family with a crook bad tempered father, self centered mother and a bully brother where no one cares about one another. How can someone say that psychologically abused children should watch this movie, it would only reopened their wounds and would have to take more antidepressants then before and watching that crazy monster headmistress throwing kids around or chasing them in that dark filthy house full of chambers of horror. Common, this is not a family or comedy movie. And the last scene, where they easily signed the adoption forms and got rid of their daughter was so hard to watch that any child watching this would get the whole life trauma and would have nightmares long after. And that nauseous scene where the fat boy is punished by eating the whole cake, and ... and ... But maybe it is just me, I don't know.

    The movie was super scary even for my 8 year old. She cried and almost felt sick because it was very gory. Advisable to watch with a parent that can explain to kids that movies are not real. My daughter watched this at school, and quite a few kids had to leave the auditorium. She did mention that there were some funny parts but the plot was very scary to her. I think that i may eventually watch this again with my kids a few years from now. I think the minimum age should be 10 years old, but i guess it depends on the kid. On another note, my 6 year old little man, did not find it too scary. We are writing this review by her urging, because she is concerned that other kids will watch it and feel like she did. So she just wants to warn everyone!!!

    In Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl addressed the problems adults face when they must deal with bratty children. In Matilda, he addresses the troubles a sweet child faces when she must deal with problem adults. I was surprised this adorable movie was not receiving better ratings, so I read the reviews of the people who hated it. One wonders what the moral was. Of course, not every children's movie has a moral. What's the moral of Harry Potter or Goonies? But this one has an obvious moral. Are there not bullies in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Are there not kind people in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Beyond morals, there's an important message. The movie tells mistreated children, in more ways than one: "you are not alone". For those wondering why Dahl did not create a dark, depressing, hopeless story for children surviving in bad homes, rather than a funny comedy, I suspect it's because the children facing such struggles don't need more darkness and hopelessness in their lives. Sure, it's a dark comedy, but that's the only way to reach such children about their problems and still bring them an uplifting movie. What's so bad about a dark comedy? Research shows that a child's quality of life is directly correlated to their mother's IQ. Most abusive and neglectful parents are simply idiots. Do mistreated children exist in this country? Ask CPS. Why should all children's movies ignore this fact? There was a time when everyone just ignored the problem completely, because it made adults that uncomfortable to deal with what was actually happening to children, but I'd rather move forward than backwards. To make matters worse, the brighter a child is, the greater his risk of abuse by jealous, stupid parents. Abraham Maslow had an IQ of 195. When he was a child, his abusive mother discovered some kittens he'd rescued and killed the kittens by beating their heads against a wall. He had many moments of despair during his childhood, and surely would have appreciated a movie like this. Being forced to care for one's self and cope so early no doubt forces kids to grow up quickly. True, many mistreated children might just be intellectually average kids who, unfortunately for them, happen to have stupid parents, so perhaps Dahl should have worried about inflating those kids' egos. There is a genius kid in the new Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but none of the reviewers are pouring venom about it. Is it just because Matilda's a girl? Heaven forbid kids get the idea that educating themselves might help them solve some of their problems, or that a love of learning is something to be proud of. Harry Potter and Annie are both movies with evil adults, some of whom try to kill the kids, yet the reviewers don't seem confused about why the adults are evil. If every adult you met in your childhood made perfect sense, was smarter than you, and never subjected you to mistreatment due to their own insecurities, then good for you. This movie is not for you. It's for the rest of us. I commend the creators of this movie for having the guts to reach out to such kids, before their despair drives them to suicide, even if some people say "but my parents were good, so why did you create a movie with bad parents?" Take a look at white trash America. I am also thrilled it was turned into a Broadway musical. Obviously, some people get it.

    The 1996 film, Matilda, has been a classic ever since it was released. This movie is one of my personal favorites due to its humorous yet touching plot. If you're looking for the perfect film to watch with your family all snuggled up with a bag of popcorn, this movie is for you. Due to its appeal to both young and old audiences, this movie is hard to criticize. While most of the movie is light-hearted due to Matilda's charming innocence amongst the negativity around her, other parts of the movie exhibit heart-wrenching situations that a kid shouldn't have to endure, efficiently teaching genuine life lessons about the importance of family. Matilda, only five years old at the start of the movie, is the youngest person in her family. Her parents barely acknowledge that she's alive by constantly favoring their older son, Michael, and disregarding anything that Matilda says. The audience is immediately attracted to Matilda's polite charm and ability to stay positive despite the fact that her family has neglected her. At just five years old, Matilda learns to live by herself; cooking and cleaning without any help from her family. Although a five year old providing for his or herself is wrong and meant to be sympathized, the audience can't help but adore Matilda's charisma and innocence in what should be a sad and somber situation. When Matilda's burning desire to learn finally convinces her dad to enroll her in school, she meets many people that actually care about her. Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, and all of her classmates are amazed at the amount of knowledge she already has at such a young age. On top of being the smartest in her class, Matilda is also well-liked by her peers. It is encouraging for the audience to see Matilda finally getting the attention she lacks at home. At school, Matilda's best friends, Lavender and Hortensia, constantly urge her to use her secret telekinetic powers. When the evil principal, Miss Trunchbull, came to Miss Honey's class one day, Matilda used her telekinetic powers to spill Miss Trunchbull's water glass everywhere to make her leave the room. By giving Matilda fictional telekinetic powers, it creates a sense of magic that both young and old audiences can relate to. Amongst the trouble that Matilda goes through at home, the magical powers she has can be seen as a symbol of strength. One of the main reasons that this movie is outstanding is because it's not only adult-friendly, but it's also kid-friendly. The plot is a perfect combination of serious and humorous events. The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.

    Adversity serves as the mother of invention for the characters in director Danny Devito's "Matilda," imaginative juvenile fantasy inspired by British author Roald Dahl bestseller. Previously, Hollywood tapped another Dahl effort "James and the Giant Peach" that met with indifferent box office results. The best rendering thus far of a Dahl tale was "The Witches" (1990) where a little boy is turned into a mouse by a local coven. Although aimed at an adolescent audience, "Matilda" emerges as a tolerably sticky gray (just short of black comedy whose rich visual style provides something for adults to savor. Distorted lens and low-angle photography give this yarn an optical sophistication that older audiences will appreciate and a carnival atmosphere that will delight younger audiences. Devito appears to be imitating Terry Gilliam's bizarre film fantasies like "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys." Aside from the title heroine and her peers, the adult characters are not only warped but downright freakish. What could have been a depressing tale about a neglected and unwanted little girl takes on an upbeat mischievous quality. The filmmakers suggest that the younger you are the better, and that adulthood sabotages the joys of adolescence. As the film unfolds, Harry Wormwood (Danny Devito of "Batman Returns") takes one look at his newborn baby daughter, screws his face up in disgust, and walks out. Wormwood is a sleazy, low-life, miser who sells junk autos at sky rocket prices and traffics in purloined car parts. The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents. While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set. Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme. If the obnoxious Wormwoods and Ms. Trunchbull represent hideous extroverts, then Miss Honey epitomizes the humble introvert. Clearly, "Matilda" endorses the latter behavior. The only good adults are the docile adults. Mara Wilson steals the show as the eponymous protagonist. You may remember Mara from the Robin Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire." If you adore her saccharine personality in that movie, you will love "Matilda." Arguably, "Matilda" falls short of being a classic because both the character of Matilda and actress Mara Wilson are far too cute to be credible. Funny and inventive as it is at times, "Matilda" never escapes its repressively formulaic origins. Children will obviously have more fun at "Matilda" than adults.

    Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged.

When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant. In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography.

The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

It uses catchy phrases to make your mind wonder. Once watching it the first time, you Will be edging to watch it again or buy it on DVD whilst children will be nagging for it to Be On. It's one of the most memorable films I've seen, and I highly recommend it to viewers of all ages.

    This is certainly not a comedy, nor a family movie, it is actually against the family. I would easily compare this to An American Crime (2007) movie. Filmmakers understate and trying to make funny a vy sad situation of a girl born to an egoistic and dysfunctional family with a crook bad tempered father, self centered mother and a bully brother where no one cares about one another. How can someone say that psychologically abused children should watch this movie, it would only reopened their wounds and would have to take more antidepressants then before and watching that crazy monster headmistress throwing kids around or chasing them in that dark filthy house full of chambers of horror. Common, this is not a family or comedy movie. And the last scene, where they easily signed the adoption forms and got rid of their daughter was so hard to watch that any child watching this would get the whole life trauma and would have nightmares long after. And that nauseous scene where the fat boy is punished by eating the whole cake, and ... and ... But maybe it is just me, I don't know.

    The movie was super scary even for my 8 year old. She cried and almost felt sick because it was very gory. Advisable to watch with a parent that can explain to kids that movies are not real. My daughter watched this at school, and quite a few kids had to leave the auditorium. She did mention that there were some funny parts but the plot was very scary to her. I think that i may eventually watch this again with my kids a few years from now. I think the minimum age should be 10 years old, but i guess it depends on the kid. On another note, my 6 year old little man, did not find it too scary. We are writing this review by her urging, because she is concerned that other kids will watch it and feel like she did. So she just wants to warn everyone!!!

    In Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl addressed the problems adults face when they must deal with bratty children. In Matilda, he addresses the troubles a sweet child faces when she must deal with problem adults. I was surprised this adorable movie was not receiving better ratings, so I read the reviews of the people who hated it. One wonders what the moral was. Of course, not every children's movie has a moral. What's the moral of Harry Potter or Goonies? But this one has an obvious moral. Are there not bullies in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Are there not kind people in this movie? What happens to them in the end? Beyond morals, there's an important message. The movie tells mistreated children, in more ways than one: "you are not alone". For those wondering why Dahl did not create a dark, depressing, hopeless story for children surviving in bad homes, rather than a funny comedy, I suspect it's because the children facing such struggles don't need more darkness and hopelessness in their lives. Sure, it's a dark comedy, but that's the only way to reach such children about their problems and still bring them an uplifting movie. What's so bad about a dark comedy? Research shows that a child's quality of life is directly correlated to their mother's IQ. Most abusive and neglectful parents are simply idiots. Do mistreated children exist in this country? Ask CPS. Why should all children's movies ignore this fact? There was a time when everyone just ignored the problem completely, because it made adults that uncomfortable to deal with what was actually happening to children, but I'd rather move forward than backwards. To make matters worse, the brighter a child is, the greater his risk of abuse by jealous, stupid parents. Abraham Maslow had an IQ of 195. When he was a child, his abusive mother discovered some kittens he'd rescued and killed the kittens by beating their heads against a wall. He had many moments of despair during his childhood, and surely would have appreciated a movie like this. Being forced to care for one's self and cope so early no doubt forces kids to grow up quickly. True, many mistreated children might just be intellectually average kids who, unfortunately for them, happen to have stupid parents, so perhaps Dahl should have worried about inflating those kids' egos. There is a genius kid in the new Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but none of the reviewers are pouring venom about it. Is it just because Matilda's a girl? Heaven forbid kids get the idea that educating themselves might help them solve some of their problems, or that a love of learning is something to be proud of. Harry Potter and Annie are both movies with evil adults, some of whom try to kill the kids, yet the reviewers don't seem confused about why the adults are evil. If every adult you met in your childhood made perfect sense, was smarter than you, and never subjected you to mistreatment due to their own insecurities, then good for you. This movie is not for you. It's for the rest of us. I commend the creators of this movie for having the guts to reach out to such kids, before their despair drives them to suicide, even if some people say "but my parents were good, so why did you create a movie with bad parents?" Take a look at white trash America. I am also thrilled it was turned into a Broadway musical. Obviously, some people get it.

    The 1996 film, Matilda, has been a classic ever since it was released. This movie is one of my personal favorites due to its humorous yet touching plot. If you're looking for the perfect film to watch with your family all snuggled up with a bag of popcorn, this movie is for you. Due to its appeal to both young and old audiences, this movie is hard to criticize. While most of the movie is light-hearted due to Matilda's charming innocence amongst the negativity around her, other parts of the movie exhibit heart-wrenching situations that a kid shouldn't have to endure, efficiently teaching genuine life lessons about the importance of family. Matilda, only five years old at the start of the movie, is the youngest person in her family. Her parents barely acknowledge that she's alive by constantly favoring their older son, Michael, and disregarding anything that Matilda says. The audience is immediately attracted to Matilda's polite charm and ability to stay positive despite the fact that her family has neglected her. At just five years old, Matilda learns to live by herself; cooking and cleaning without any help from her family. Although a five year old providing for his or herself is wrong and meant to be sympathized, the audience can't help but adore Matilda's charisma and innocence in what should be a sad and somber situation. When Matilda's burning desire to learn finally convinces her dad to enroll her in school, she meets many people that actually care about her. Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey, and all of her classmates are amazed at the amount of knowledge she already has at such a young age. On top of being the smartest in her class, Matilda is also well-liked by her peers. It is encouraging for the audience to see Matilda finally getting the attention she lacks at home. At school, Matilda's best friends, Lavender and Hortensia, constantly urge her to use her secret telekinetic powers. When the evil principal, Miss Trunchbull, came to Miss Honey's class one day, Matilda used her telekinetic powers to spill Miss Trunchbull's water glass everywhere to make her leave the room. By giving Matilda fictional telekinetic powers, it creates a sense of magic that both young and old audiences can relate to. Amongst the trouble that Matilda goes through at home, the magical powers she has can be seen as a symbol of strength. One of the main reasons that this movie is outstanding is because it's not only adult-friendly, but it's also kid-friendly. The plot is a perfect combination of serious and humorous events. The beginning part of the movie displays more of the darker events in Matilda's journey, such as being neglected from her family. However, in the latter part of the movie, the mood is rejuvenated when Matilda is adopted by her loving teacher, Miss Honey. By creating Matilda as sweet and lovable young child, it helps reiterate the theme that family should never be taken for granted. No matter what age, every person deserves a support system.

    Adversity serves as the mother of invention for the characters in director Danny Devito's "Matilda," imaginative juvenile fantasy inspired by British author Roald Dahl bestseller. Previously, Hollywood tapped another Dahl effort "James and the Giant Peach" that met with indifferent box office results. The best rendering thus far of a Dahl tale was "The Witches" (1990) where a little boy is turned into a mouse by a local coven. Although aimed at an adolescent audience, "Matilda" emerges as a tolerably sticky gray (just short of black comedy whose rich visual style provides something for adults to savor. Distorted lens and low-angle photography give this yarn an optical sophistication that older audiences will appreciate and a carnival atmosphere that will delight younger audiences. Devito appears to be imitating Terry Gilliam's bizarre film fantasies like "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys." Aside from the title heroine and her peers, the adult characters are not only warped but downright freakish. What could have been a depressing tale about a neglected and unwanted little girl takes on an upbeat mischievous quality. The filmmakers suggest that the younger you are the better, and that adulthood sabotages the joys of adolescence. As the film unfolds, Harry Wormwood (Danny Devito of "Batman Returns") takes one look at his newborn baby daughter, screws his face up in disgust, and walks out. Wormwood is a sleazy, low-life, miser who sells junk autos at sky rocket prices and traffics in purloined car parts. The FBI assigns two oafish field agents (Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee's "Blow") and Tracy Walters of "Batman") to keep tabs on the unscrupulous car dealer. When Harry takes his wife Zinia (Devito's real-life spouse Rhea Perlman) finally bring baby Matilda home from the hospital, they leave her in the car. Matilda grows up with virtually no adult supervision and is better for it. Her parents as well as an older brother leave her to her own fantasies. As her cretinous father observers at one point, somebody has to stay at home to sign for the packages delivered to the front door. But Matilda refuses to languish under these trying circumstances. She masters basic culinary skills by age four. Later, she plunges herself into the world of literature. She devours hundreds of books from a nearby library, all to the chagrin of her parents. While parental neglect prompts Matilda to read books, her father's anger precipitates the appearance of her strange telekinetic powers. Matilda learns that she can pour her own bowl of cereal and eat it without touching the box, bowl, or spoon. At this point, "Matilda" stops being a John Hughes comedy and turns into a precociously bratty version of the 1996 John Travolta tearjerker "Phenomenon." Eventually, Harry and Zinia send Matilda to school. This school would make the Bastille look like a daycare center. Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris of "Death to Smoochy"), a child-hating Amazon with an attitude, rules the school with an iron fist. If a child arouses her wrath, she hoists them aloft and hurls them out the window like a javelin. At school, Matilda finds love and understanding in a meek, spinsterish first-grade teacher , Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz of "Bridget Jones's Diary") and they grow to be best friends. Eventually, the tyrannical Ms. Trunchbull turns her rage on poor Miss Honey and Matilda abandons her forbearance. She devises several frightening but harmless stunts that send the hated headmistress into a tailspin. Antics such as these are calculated to draw applause from the younger set. Adults on the whole take a beating in "Matilda." Their stereotypical depiction places them at either end of the extreme. If the obnoxious Wormwoods and Ms. Trunchbull represent hideous extroverts, then Miss Honey epitomizes the humble introvert. Clearly, "Matilda" endorses the latter behavior. The only good adults are the docile adults. Mara Wilson steals the show as the eponymous protagonist. You may remember Mara from the Robin Williams comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire." If you adore her saccharine personality in that movie, you will love "Matilda." Arguably, "Matilda" falls short of being a classic because both the character of Matilda and actress Mara Wilson are far too cute to be credible. Funny and inventive as it is at times, "Matilda" never escapes its repressively formulaic origins. Children will obviously have more fun at "Matilda" than adults.

    Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender. True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British "Headmistress" engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American "Principal". Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it. But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time. Whatever it is, and in spite of the fact it is no excuse at all, the fondness for childcare and such has long since evaporated from the Wormwoods as we witness Matlida develop through the stages of growth into an infant. In this sense, she had to, because any other child would have died. Her father, Harry, is a short and stocky individual; a slimy and fast-talking businessman; an optimisation of greed, a man about as oily and greasy as the mechanical interiors to those second-hand cars he flogs to unsuspecting customers when many-a thing are wrong with them. Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her. What little joy she has with her parents during the early stages of her life occurs when she plays practical jokes on them; a scene at a restaurant after they've all gone out for dinner begins with a shot of a tray of cakes being wheeled out of the kitchen and around the bunched up tables  then we realise Matilda's father has his hat stuck to his head on account of some super glue, and if we cannot anticipate the messy end to the scene involving said cakes, we just aren't trying hard enough. It is whilst at school that the events which set in motion Matilda's change in life occur, only it is initially a school run by the aforementioned Agatha Trunchbull and it isn't so much a school as it is a prisoner of war camp - a place with high fences accompanied by barbed wire; a solitary confinement room as well as, and it'll probably upset others more than it did me, a large brick chimney on top of one of the more lower key structures in the compound which acts as a somewhat misplaced piece of concentration camp-like iconography. At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian  where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience. It's a very difficult film to hate, a very easy film to get into but a tough film to feel an awful lot more than indifferent about.

    Story of a girl, story of life. Matilda, Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey,... Names that will remain in my head forever. Matilda was my childhood favorite movie. When I was 12, I watched it almost everyday, mostly at the school's video club during lunch times, till I turned 15. I love this movie because it is entertaining, touching, funny, the dialogues are convincing, actors are playing their roles with great success and the music from David Newman that perfectly fits to the movie is just beautiful and pleasant to listen to. I read the book many times and this movie is one of the rarest production that preserves the story and the atmosphere from the book. Of course, some details and scenes from the book have voluntary been cut or re-adapted but these changes doesn't affect on the magic of the writing. Mara Wilson is a great actress on it. Her leading role as a kid suffering from misunderstanding by her family, leading her to use later on her "special ability" to gain respect from her surrounding or bring some justice back is just perfect. When I was a kid, this movie touched me because I identified myself to Matilda. After parent's divorce, my childhood life was the same as Matilda's: parents looked upon me as nothing more as a scab and I had some nasty teachers. The movie helped me a lot to keep some happiness. I am 24 right now, and I decided to watch it again. It's the only movie in the world in which I can spend hours watching in a row in circle like a kid without feeling bored. And watching it one time is enough to bring some joy of living for a few days. My future kids will love it. This movie is universal for a whole generation, even if unfortunately, it's not very famous. It deserves to be because it's a lesson for kids and parents about life. But I spread this beautiful piece of art amongst my friends and they all enjoyed it. It deserves a bluray adaptation.
