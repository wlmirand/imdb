 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Sparks fly and cultures collide in this romantic comedy about a casual night of passion that turns into the love of a lifetime.

But Alex doesn't see Isabel again until three months later, when he learns she is pregnant. On a whim and prayer, he proposes. However, there's more to marriage than a Vegas chapel and an Elvis impersonator, as Alex and Isabel soon learn.

    This movie is so clearly not bad. Fools Rush In is one of the better romantic comedies, that's a little known fact. It has really sharp editing, fine directing, good cinematography, really good acting and really good writing. Fools Rush In's editing and story presentation is particularly very strong. Fools Rush In has very rich colors. The writing is natural, genuine. It's really funny, but Fools Rush In is more so good than funny, which is much more of an accomplishment. This movie is all about Alex Whitman and Isabel Fuentes. Matthew Perry is in his best role. Perry's very well-cast and there aren't many actors out of anybody better for the part. He's good for the character and is very lovable. Perry poses as the main star but he's just for show. This is quietly though obviously Salma Hayek's film. She is perfect for the part, perfect. Salma Hayek gives you real heart acting very womanly and comes across as all too sweet. Fools Rush In is a very sweet romantic comedy. It's an easy film to enjoy. I am particularly very fond of Fools Rush In.

    I have read some reviews here, and many people think this is a conventional romantic comedy, it really is not. It is about not being truly happy with your life, and when you discover what you want, being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to keep it. One of these is overcoming your fears. This is what Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), and photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayak), have to do throughout the film. One big issue is the families involved: Alex's are blue blood WASP types, and Isabel's are very traditional Mexicans. It is also Alex's story (far more than Isabel's), and how he really does not like his life, he just does not know any other way. One thing he does, is instead of joining the Country Club set, is studying architecture, at Yale. While going to Yale, is expected for someone like him, taking a difficult major outside the family business was not. So was marrying Cathy Stewart (Suzanne Snyder), who to quote Alex "Was pursuing me since the 3rd Grade." Since the Stewart's were good friends of his parent's (John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real life father) and Jill Clayburgh), it would have been the easy thing simply to marry her, and please them (Although he finds it difficult to stand up to them (Which will create problems later on)). Spoilers Ahead: He and his best friend Jeff (Jon Tenny) are transferred From the New York office where they work, to Las Vegas for a construction project. He then meets Isabel in a Mexican Restaurant and lets her cut the line to the bathroom, and from there they have a one night stand, and then she disappears. Month's later, she shows up pregnant, and he offers to meet her family, so she would not be shamed into being pregnant with someone they never met. When he does, he really likes the big family environment and comments on how his family never eats together. He then offers to any marry her, and he is happy with her, until his parent's show up, and he cannot admit to them Isabel is his wife. From there, the relationship starts to sour, because of family issues, mistrust, lies (She told him she had an miscarriage), and their fears. In one scene Isabel goes to Mexico to visit her great grandmother, and admitted how much she loved Alex, but was afraid of being hurt. They finally agree to get a divorce, but Alex (Now back in New York) is miserable. He runs into a Priest, who tells him "There are signs out there." Pictures of The Grand Canyon, a chihuahua, and a little girl named Isabel, remind him of her, and he does not want the divorce (Although time is running out). So he goes down to Mexico (Where he found out she was), and takes a cheap plane from Mexico City, an old bus, and a mule, to get to her great grandmother's only to find out she was heading back to Las Vegas (He had no idea it was to bear his child, since he did not speak or understand Spanish). He gets there first, and is standing on Hoover Dam, and a huge rainstorm happens and he gets drenched. Finally she is driving and sees him and almost causes an accident. She is mad at him (And more at herself because she lost hope (She broke up with a previous boy friend because a necklace broke which to her was a sign)), then he finds out she is still pregnant, and they both admit they were lying and afraid. Then her water broke, and she is going to have the baby right on the Dam. What really impresses her, is the fact that he would travel all the way to Mexico just for her (He had no idea she was still pregnant). When the baby comes (A girl), Isabel asks "Do you think she will like living in New York City?' Alex says "Not as much as camping in the desert." A key point, because one of Isabel's brother's explained, that her life is here, and she would not be happy anywhere else. Then Isabel said "With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs (A famous New York hot dog)." Alex then says, "Oh no." Isabel says:' What?" Alex says "We're divorced." Of course, that will change when they are married again (This time in a traditional way at The Grand Canyon (Unlike the first time by an Elvis impersonator and without the families there)). I am a huge Salma fan, and she is at her best here. But this is Perry's film, and his scenes are the funny ones: Getting cactus needles in his behind after going camping and landing in a pit of rattlesnakes, and the rain scene. But he is also the one who is willing to do whatever is necessary to have Isabel, and that means leaving his prior life behind, and not only accepting but embracing hers. This is one of my favorite films of all-time. 10/10 stars.

But Alex doesn't see Isabel again until three months later, when he learns she is pregnant. On a whim and prayer, he proposes. However, there's more to marriage than a Vegas chapel and an Elvis impersonator, as Alex and Isabel soon learn...... I can imagine the producers saying to Perry on the first day of filming 'just be Chandler, everyone loves Chandler', and that is what he does, not because he has no other range but because the makers know that people of a certain age will relate to him, and see the film because of his success in Friends. And thats wherein the problem lies. The vehicle isn't for Perry, it's for Chandler, and in my opinion, he is the most annoying one from that series. So thank heavens for Hayek, who shows here that she isn't just beautiful, but she can carry a film and make it that little more interesting when shes on screen. The story is amiable enough and quite sweet, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and we will see plenty of them again. It's pretty forgettable stuff, which is a shame, because Hayek is great..

    I can't recall movies falling in this genre making huge, big bucks, I can't recall movies falling in this genre being 100% realistic. But, this movie is something maybe people who are in inter cultural marriages can relate to or maybe not. This movie is based on a true story, it's about a one night stand, a pregnancy and how it takes toll on the lives of two people who barely know each other yet share the most complex bond there is. Salma Hayek is awesome and very pretty in this movie, and yes she looks like a natural, casual effortless beauty. I expect when this movie was released Matthew Perry was at the epitome of his career and the zenith of his looks! It's a good watch people. I mean you won't waste your time watching this sometimes things may get predictable but I suggest you go with it...

    each time that I watch it. There's some charm about it that draws me in. I love the chemistry between the actors. I like the music and the scenes are heartfelt, but also make you laugh at times. I think the definition of a good movie is when it evokes an emotion from you then transform that emotion in a split second. I will be crying from happiness then a joke will pop up or something and in the next second I'm laughing. So I recommend anyone to rent this movie if they are looking for a perfect romantic comedy. I guess this movie is like my romantic guilty pleasure. I watch it all the time and always will.

    Matthew Perry's films haven't been great successes but for what its worth I think that this is one of his best. Although we see many of the elements of his character from the hit show "Friends" this is what we love to see from Perry and he plays it to perfection. He has good chemistry with Hayek and the overall plot of this film is strong. It has elements of comedy and also a lot of drama which is unusual for a romantic comedy. This element means that Perry is allowed to play some scenes with depth and we see that he is also a fine dramatic actor. Overall although this film was not overly well reviewed and hasn't made much of an impression on the world it is well worth seeking out as it is a good film and showcases the talent of Perry perfectly.

    I was wondering to myself whether a film with one of the male stars of Friends as the lead would be just a naff as anything with Jennifer Aniston, so I spotted this recognisably titled one, from director Andy Tennant (Anna and the King, Hitch). Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex. She tells him that she is pregnant, even though it was a one night stand and he used a condom, which was ineffective, but she is and she wants to keep the baby. Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her "boyfriend". Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again. But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song "Can't Help Falling In Love" playing, which features the lyric "only fools rush in". Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos G&oacute;mez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    I was surprised at how much I liked Fools Rush In. The story is nothing special, and it may drag in spots. But I loved the beautiful cinematography and scenery, the lovely music, the funny and charming screenplay and the direction was surprisingly well handled. The acting from the two leads is excellent. Although his character is very like Chandler from Friends, in terms of the slapstick schtick and the funny lines, Matthew Perry is very effective in his role. Same with Salma Hayek, who is both beautiful and charming here, and shows good chemistry with Perry. Overall, I liked it very much and I wasn't expecting to. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father. The real star of the movie is Las Vegas itself. Shown here is a softer, less known side of Vegas in breathtaking panoramic shots, far from the lights and showgirls, and if the film succeeds anywhere it's in it's ability to immerse and intoxicate the audience with the visuals. Against that backdrop we are treated to a glimpse of a Mexican American family that has a very genuine feel to it. If you mourn the death of the Romantic Comedy and you've exhausted the finer examples of the genre then maybe this one is worth a gamble. Oh yeah Salma Hayek is in it. =)

    Boy {Matthew Perry} meets Girl {Salma Hayek} in a queue for the toilet in a club. Cue both people from different ethnicities ending up in bed together doing something that neither of them have done before. Cue three months later and Girl tuns up in Boys life announcing she's pregnant. Cue emotions pulled apart, a hasty marriage, family strife and many stumbling blocks getting in the way of potential true love. Sound familiar? Not surprisingly this retread of a formula that is as old as the hills has very little originality. The script is desperately dull, the ending is exactly what the world expects and the leads have zero chemistry. That only Perry and Hayek are "names" in the film speaks volumes one feels. You get the sense that what budget there was went on getting the sexy Hayek and Perry {riding on the crest of his Friends wave} to appear. Little flashes of comedy do from time to time surface, and, yes, those who like a cheery cup of the love froth with their rom-coms will feel fuzzy come the end. But really it's a poorly constructed and executed picture, the type that unfortunately seems to come out on a yearly basis. You have been warned, stick with a Cary Grant movie instead. 3/10

But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song "Can't Help Falling In Love" playing, which features the lyric "only fools rush in". Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos G&oacute;mez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    I was surprised at how much I liked Fools Rush In. The story is nothing special, and it may drag in spots. But I loved the beautiful cinematography and scenery, the lovely music, the funny and charming screenplay and the direction was surprisingly well handled. The acting from the two leads is excellent. Although his character is very like Chandler from Friends, in terms of the slapstick schtick and the funny lines, Matthew Perry is very effective in his role. Same with Salma Hayek, who is both beautiful and charming here, and shows good chemistry with Perry. Overall, I liked it very much and I wasn't expecting to. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father. The real star of the movie is Las Vegas itself. Shown here is a softer, less known side of Vegas in breathtaking panoramic shots, far from the lights and showgirls, and if the film succeeds anywhere it's in it's ability to immerse and intoxicate the audience with the visuals. Against that backdrop we are treated to a glimpse of a Mexican American family that has a very genuine feel to it. If you mourn the death of the Romantic Comedy and you've exhausted the finer examples of the genre then maybe this one is worth a gamble. Oh yeah Salma Hayek is in it. =)

    Boy {Matthew Perry} meets Girl {Salma Hayek} in a queue for the toilet in a club. Cue both people from different ethnicities ending up in bed together doing something that neither of them have done before. Cue three months later and Girl tuns up in Boys life announcing she's pregnant. Cue emotions pulled apart, a hasty marriage, family strife and many stumbling blocks getting in the way of potential true love. Sound familiar? Not surprisingly this retread of a formula that is as old as the hills has very little originality. The script is desperately dull, the ending is exactly what the world expects and the leads have zero chemistry. That only Perry and Hayek are "names" in the film speaks volumes one feels. You get the sense that what budget there was went on getting the sexy Hayek and Perry {riding on the crest of his Friends wave} to appear. Little flashes of comedy do from time to time surface, and, yes, those who like a cheery cup of the love froth with their rom-coms will feel fuzzy come the end. But really it's a poorly constructed and executed picture, the type that unfortunately seems to come out on a yearly basis. You have been warned, stick with a Cary Grant movie instead. 3/10

    This movie is so clearly not bad. Fools Rush In is one of the better romantic comedies, that's a little known fact. It has really sharp editing, fine directing, good cinematography, really good acting and really good writing. Fools Rush In's editing and story presentation is particularly very strong. Fools Rush In has very rich colors. The writing is natural, genuine. It's really funny, but Fools Rush In is more so good than funny, which is much more of an accomplishment. This movie is all about Alex Whitman and Isabel Fuentes. Matthew Perry is in his best role. Perry's very well-cast and there aren't many actors out of anybody better for the part. He's good for the character and is very lovable. Perry poses as the main star but he's just for show. This is quietly though obviously Salma Hayek's film. She is perfect for the part, perfect. Salma Hayek gives you real heart acting very womanly and comes across as all too sweet. Fools Rush In is a very sweet romantic comedy. It's an easy film to enjoy. I am particularly very fond of Fools Rush In.

    I have read some reviews here, and many people think this is a conventional romantic comedy, it really is not. It is about not being truly happy with your life, and when you discover what you want, being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to keep it. One of these is overcoming your fears. This is what Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), and photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayak), have to do throughout the film. One big issue is the families involved: Alex's are blue blood WASP types, and Isabel's are very traditional Mexicans. It is also Alex's story (far more than Isabel's), and how he really does not like his life, he just does not know any other way. One thing he does, is instead of joining the Country Club set, is studying architecture, at Yale. While going to Yale, is expected for someone like him, taking a difficult major outside the family business was not. So was marrying Cathy Stewart (Suzanne Snyder), who to quote Alex "Was pursuing me since the 3rd Grade." Since the Stewart's were good friends of his parent's (John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real life father) and Jill Clayburgh), it would have been the easy thing simply to marry her, and please them (Although he finds it difficult to stand up to them (Which will create problems later on)). Spoilers Ahead: He and his best friend Jeff (Jon Tenny) are transferred From the New York office where they work, to Las Vegas for a construction project. He then meets Isabel in a Mexican Restaurant and lets her cut the line to the bathroom, and from there they have a one night stand, and then she disappears. Month's later, she shows up pregnant, and he offers to meet her family, so she would not be shamed into being pregnant with someone they never met. When he does, he really likes the big family environment and comments on how his family never eats together. He then offers to any marry her, and he is happy with her, until his parent's show up, and he cannot admit to them Isabel is his wife. From there, the relationship starts to sour, because of family issues, mistrust, lies (She told him she had an miscarriage), and their fears. In one scene Isabel goes to Mexico to visit her great grandmother, and admitted how much she loved Alex, but was afraid of being hurt. They finally agree to get a divorce, but Alex (Now back in New York) is miserable. He runs into a Priest, who tells him "There are signs out there." Pictures of The Grand Canyon, a chihuahua, and a little girl named Isabel, remind him of her, and he does not want the divorce (Although time is running out). So he goes down to Mexico (Where he found out she was), and takes a cheap plane from Mexico City, an old bus, and a mule, to get to her great grandmother's only to find out she was heading back to Las Vegas (He had no idea it was to bear his child, since he did not speak or understand Spanish). He gets there first, and is standing on Hoover Dam, and a huge rainstorm happens and he gets drenched. Finally she is driving and sees him and almost causes an accident. She is mad at him (And more at herself because she lost hope (She broke up with a previous boy friend because a necklace broke which to her was a sign)), then he finds out she is still pregnant, and they both admit they were lying and afraid. Then her water broke, and she is going to have the baby right on the Dam. What really impresses her, is the fact that he would travel all the way to Mexico just for her (He had no idea she was still pregnant). When the baby comes (A girl), Isabel asks "Do you think she will like living in New York City?' Alex says "Not as much as camping in the desert." A key point, because one of Isabel's brother's explained, that her life is here, and she would not be happy anywhere else. Then Isabel said "With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs (A famous New York hot dog)." Alex then says, "Oh no." Isabel says:' What?" Alex says "We're divorced." Of course, that will change when they are married again (This time in a traditional way at The Grand Canyon (Unlike the first time by an Elvis impersonator and without the families there)). I am a huge Salma fan, and she is at her best here. But this is Perry's film, and his scenes are the funny ones: Getting cactus needles in his behind after going camping and landing in a pit of rattlesnakes, and the rain scene. But he is also the one who is willing to do whatever is necessary to have Isabel, and that means leaving his prior life behind, and not only accepting but embracing hers. This is one of my favorite films of all-time. 10/10 stars.

    Alex Whitman is a New Yorker sent to Las Vegas to oversee a construction project. There he meets Isabel, and some serious chemistry brings them together for one night. But Alex doesn't see Isabel again until three months later, when he learns she is pregnant. On a whim and prayer, he proposes. However, there's more to marriage than a Vegas chapel and an Elvis impersonator, as Alex and Isabel soon learn...... I can imagine the producers saying to Perry on the first day of filming 'just be Chandler, everyone loves Chandler', and that is what he does, not because he has no other range but because the makers know that people of a certain age will relate to him, and see the film because of his success in Friends. And thats wherein the problem lies. The vehicle isn't for Perry, it's for Chandler, and in my opinion, he is the most annoying one from that series. So thank heavens for Hayek, who shows here that she isn't just beautiful, but she can carry a film and make it that little more interesting when shes on screen. The story is amiable enough and quite sweet, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and we will see plenty of them again. It's pretty forgettable stuff, which is a shame, because Hayek is great..

    I can't recall movies falling in this genre making huge, big bucks, I can't recall movies falling in this genre being 100% realistic. But, this movie is something maybe people who are in inter cultural marriages can relate to or maybe not. This movie is based on a true story, it's about a one night stand, a pregnancy and how it takes toll on the lives of two people who barely know each other yet share the most complex bond there is. Salma Hayek is awesome and very pretty in this movie, and yes she looks like a natural, casual effortless beauty. I expect when this movie was released Matthew Perry was at the epitome of his career and the zenith of his looks! It's a good watch people. I mean you won't waste your time watching this sometimes things may get predictable but I suggest you go with it...

    each time that I watch it. There's some charm about it that draws me in. I love the chemistry between the actors. I like the music and the scenes are heartfelt, but also make you laugh at times. I think the definition of a good movie is when it evokes an emotion from you then transform that emotion in a split second. I will be crying from happiness then a joke will pop up or something and in the next second I'm laughing. So I recommend anyone to rent this movie if they are looking for a perfect romantic comedy. I guess this movie is like my romantic guilty pleasure. I watch it all the time and always will.

    Matthew Perry's films haven't been great successes but for what its worth I think that this is one of his best. Although we see many of the elements of his character from the hit show "Friends" this is what we love to see from Perry and he plays it to perfection. He has good chemistry with Hayek and the overall plot of this film is strong. It has elements of comedy and also a lot of drama which is unusual for a romantic comedy. This element means that Perry is allowed to play some scenes with depth and we see that he is also a fine dramatic actor. Overall although this film was not overly well reviewed and hasn't made much of an impression on the world it is well worth seeking out as it is a good film and showcases the talent of Perry perfectly.

    I was wondering to myself whether a film with one of the male stars of Friends as the lead would be just a naff as anything with Jennifer Aniston, so I spotted this recognisably titled one, from director Andy Tennant (Anna and the King, Hitch). Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex. She tells him that she is pregnant, even though it was a one night stand and he used a condom, which was ineffective, but she is and she wants to keep the baby. Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her "boyfriend". Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again. But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song "Can't Help Falling In Love" playing, which features the lyric "only fools rush in". Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos G&oacute;mez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father. The real star of the movie is Las Vegas itself. Shown here is a softer, less known side of Vegas in breathtaking panoramic shots, far from the lights and showgirls, and if the film succeeds anywhere it's in it's ability to immerse and intoxicate the audience with the visuals.

I will be crying from happiness then a joke will pop up or something and in the next second I'm laughing. So I recommend anyone to rent this movie if they are looking for a perfect romantic comedy. I guess this movie is like my romantic guilty pleasure. I watch it all the time and always will.

    Matthew Perry's films haven't been great successes but for what its worth I think that this is one of his best. Although we see many of the elements of his character from the hit show "Friends" this is what we love to see from Perry and he plays it to perfection. He has good chemistry with Hayek and the overall plot of this film is strong. It has elements of comedy and also a lot of drama which is unusual for a romantic comedy. This element means that Perry is allowed to play some scenes with depth and we see that he is also a fine dramatic actor. Overall although this film was not overly well reviewed and hasn't made much of an impression on the world it is well worth seeking out as it is a good film and showcases the talent of Perry perfectly.

    I was wondering to myself whether a film with one of the male stars of Friends as the lead would be just a naff as anything with Jennifer Aniston, so I spotted this recognisably titled one, from director Andy Tennant (Anna and the King, Hitch). Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex. She tells him that she is pregnant, even though it was a one night stand and he used a condom, which was ineffective, but she is and she wants to keep the baby. Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her "boyfriend". Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again. But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song "Can't Help Falling In Love" playing, which features the lyric "only fools rush in". Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos G&oacute;mez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    I was surprised at how much I liked Fools Rush In. The story is nothing special, and it may drag in spots. But I loved the beautiful cinematography and scenery, the lovely music, the funny and charming screenplay and the direction was surprisingly well handled. The acting from the two leads is excellent. Although his character is very like Chandler from Friends, in terms of the slapstick schtick and the funny lines, Matthew Perry is very effective in his role. Same with Salma Hayek, who is both beautiful and charming here, and shows good chemistry with Perry. Overall, I liked it very much and I wasn't expecting to. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father. The real star of the movie is Las Vegas itself. Shown here is a softer, less known side of Vegas in breathtaking panoramic shots, far from the lights and showgirls, and if the film succeeds anywhere it's in it's ability to immerse and intoxicate the audience with the visuals. Against that backdrop we are treated to a glimpse of a Mexican American family that has a very genuine feel to it. If you mourn the death of the Romantic Comedy and you've exhausted the finer examples of the genre then maybe this one is worth a gamble. Oh yeah Salma Hayek is in it. =)

    Boy {Matthew Perry} meets Girl {Salma Hayek} in a queue for the toilet in a club. Cue both people from different ethnicities ending up in bed together doing something that neither of them have done before. Cue three months later and Girl tuns up in Boys life announcing she's pregnant. Cue emotions pulled apart, a hasty marriage, family strife and many stumbling blocks getting in the way of potential true love. Sound familiar? Not surprisingly this retread of a formula that is as old as the hills has very little originality. The script is desperately dull, the ending is exactly what the world expects and the leads have zero chemistry. That only Perry and Hayek are "names" in the film speaks volumes one feels. You get the sense that what budget there was went on getting the sexy Hayek and Perry {riding on the crest of his Friends wave} to appear. Little flashes of comedy do from time to time surface, and, yes, those who like a cheery cup of the love froth with their rom-coms will feel fuzzy come the end. But really it's a poorly constructed and executed picture, the type that unfortunately seems to come out on a yearly basis. You have been warned, stick with a Cary Grant movie instead. 3/10

    This movie is so clearly not bad. Fools Rush In is one of the better romantic comedies, that's a little known fact. It has really sharp editing, fine directing, good cinematography, really good acting and really good writing. Fools Rush In's editing and story presentation is particularly very strong. Fools Rush In has very rich colors. The writing is natural, genuine. It's really funny, but Fools Rush In is more so good than funny, which is much more of an accomplishment. This movie is all about Alex Whitman and Isabel Fuentes. Matthew Perry is in his best role. Perry's very well-cast and there aren't many actors out of anybody better for the part. He's good for the character and is very lovable. Perry poses as the main star but he's just for show. This is quietly though obviously Salma Hayek's film. She is perfect for the part, perfect. Salma Hayek gives you real heart acting very womanly and comes across as all too sweet. Fools Rush In is a very sweet romantic comedy. It's an easy film to enjoy. I am particularly very fond of Fools Rush In.

    I have read some reviews here, and many people think this is a conventional romantic comedy, it really is not. It is about not being truly happy with your life, and when you discover what you want, being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to keep it. One of these is overcoming your fears. This is what Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), and photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayak), have to do throughout the film. One big issue is the families involved: Alex's are blue blood WASP types, and Isabel's are very traditional Mexicans. It is also Alex's story (far more than Isabel's), and how he really does not like his life, he just does not know any other way. One thing he does, is instead of joining the Country Club set, is studying architecture, at Yale. While going to Yale, is expected for someone like him, taking a difficult major outside the family business was not. So was marrying Cathy Stewart (Suzanne Snyder), who to quote Alex "Was pursuing me since the 3rd Grade." Since the Stewart's were good friends of his parent's (John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real life father) and Jill Clayburgh), it would have been the easy thing simply to marry her, and please them (Although he finds it difficult to stand up to them (Which will create problems later on)). Spoilers Ahead: He and his best friend Jeff (Jon Tenny) are transferred From the New York office where they work, to Las Vegas for a construction project. He then meets Isabel in a Mexican Restaurant and lets her cut the line to the bathroom, and from there they have a one night stand, and then she disappears. Month's later, she shows up pregnant, and he offers to meet her family, so she would not be shamed into being pregnant with someone they never met. When he does, he really likes the big family environment and comments on how his family never eats together. He then offers to any marry her, and he is happy with her, until his parent's show up, and he cannot admit to them Isabel is his wife. From there, the relationship starts to sour, because of family issues, mistrust, lies (She told him she had an miscarriage), and their fears. In one scene Isabel goes to Mexico to visit her great grandmother, and admitted how much she loved Alex, but was afraid of being hurt. They finally agree to get a divorce, but Alex (Now back in New York) is miserable. He runs into a Priest, who tells him "There are signs out there." Pictures of The Grand Canyon, a chihuahua, and a little girl named Isabel, remind him of her, and he does not want the divorce (Although time is running out). So he goes down to Mexico (Where he found out she was), and takes a cheap plane from Mexico City, an old bus, and a mule, to get to her great grandmother's only to find out she was heading back to Las Vegas (He had no idea it was to bear his child, since he did not speak or understand Spanish). He gets there first, and is standing on Hoover Dam, and a huge rainstorm happens and he gets drenched. Finally she is driving and sees him and almost causes an accident. She is mad at him (And more at herself because she lost hope (She broke up with a previous boy friend because a necklace broke which to her was a sign)), then he finds out she is still pregnant, and they both admit they were lying and afraid. Then her water broke, and she is going to have the baby right on the Dam. What really impresses her, is the fact that he would travel all the way to Mexico just for her (He had no idea she was still pregnant). When the baby comes (A girl), Isabel asks "Do you think she will like living in New York City?' Alex says "Not as much as camping in the desert." A key point, because one of Isabel's brother's explained, that her life is here, and she would not be happy anywhere else. Then Isabel said "With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs (A famous New York hot dog)." Alex then says, "Oh no." Isabel says:' What?" Alex says "We're divorced." Of course, that will change when they are married again (This time in a traditional way at The Grand Canyon (Unlike the first time by an Elvis impersonator and without the families there)). I am a huge Salma fan, and she is at her best here. But this is Perry's film, and his scenes are the funny ones: Getting cactus needles in his behind after going camping and landing in a pit of rattlesnakes, and the rain scene. But he is also the one who is willing to do whatever is necessary to have Isabel, and that means leaving his prior life behind, and not only accepting but embracing hers. This is one of my favorite films of all-time. 10/10 stars.

    Alex Whitman is a New Yorker sent to Las Vegas to oversee a construction project. There he meets Isabel, and some serious chemistry brings them together for one night. But Alex doesn't see Isabel again until three months later, when he learns she is pregnant. On a whim and prayer, he proposes. However, there's more to marriage than a Vegas chapel and an Elvis impersonator, as Alex and Isabel soon learn...... I can imagine the producers saying to Perry on the first day of filming 'just be Chandler, everyone loves Chandler', and that is what he does, not because he has no other range but because the makers know that people of a certain age will relate to him, and see the film because of his success in Friends. And thats wherein the problem lies. The vehicle isn't for Perry, it's for Chandler, and in my opinion, he is the most annoying one from that series. So thank heavens for Hayek, who shows here that she isn't just beautiful, but she can carry a film and make it that little more interesting when shes on screen. The story is amiable enough and quite sweet, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and we will see plenty of them again. It's pretty forgettable stuff, which is a shame, because Hayek is great..

    I can't recall movies falling in this genre making huge, big bucks, I can't recall movies falling in this genre being 100% realistic. But, this movie is something maybe people who are in inter cultural marriages can relate to or maybe not. This movie is based on a true story, it's about a one night stand, a pregnancy and how it takes toll on the lives of two people who barely know each other yet share the most complex bond there is. Salma Hayek is awesome and very pretty in this movie, and yes she looks like a natural, casual effortless beauty. I expect when this movie was released Matthew Perry was at the epitome of his career and the zenith of his looks! It's a good watch people. I mean you won't waste your time watching this sometimes things may get predictable but I suggest you go with it...

I think the definition of a good movie is when it evokes an emotion from you then transform that emotion in a split second. I will be crying from happiness then a joke will pop up or something and in the next second I'm laughing. So I recommend anyone to rent this movie if they are looking for a perfect romantic comedy. I guess this movie is like my romantic guilty pleasure. I watch it all the time and always will.

    I was wondering to myself whether a film with one of the male stars of Friends as the lead would be just a naff as anything with Jennifer Aniston, so I spotted this recognisably titled one, from director Andy Tennant (Anna and the King, Hitch). Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex. She tells him that she is pregnant, even though it was a one night stand and he used a condom, which was ineffective, but she is and she wants to keep the baby. Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her "boyfriend". Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again. But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song "Can't Help Falling In Love" playing, which features the lyric "only fools rush in". Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos G&oacute;mez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father.

This is one of my favorite films of all-time. 10/10 stars.

But Alex doesn't see Isabel again until three months later, when he learns she is pregnant. On a whim and prayer, he proposes. However, there's more to marriage than a Vegas chapel and an Elvis impersonator, as Alex and Isabel soon learn...... I can imagine the producers saying to Perry on the first day of filming 'just be Chandler, everyone loves Chandler', and that is what he does, not because he has no other range but because the makers know that people of a certain age will relate to him, and see the film because of his success in Friends. And thats wherein the problem lies. The vehicle isn't for Perry, it's for Chandler, and in my opinion, he is the most annoying one from that series. So thank heavens for Hayek, who shows here that she isn't just beautiful, but she can carry a film and make it that little more interesting when shes on screen. The story is amiable enough and quite sweet, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and we will see plenty of them again. It's pretty forgettable stuff, which is a shame, because Hayek is great..

    I can't recall movies falling in this genre making huge, big bucks, I can't recall movies falling in this genre being 100% realistic. But, this movie is something maybe people who are in inter cultural marriages can relate to or maybe not. This movie is based on a true story, it's about a one night stand, a pregnancy and how it takes toll on the lives of two people who barely know each other yet share the most complex bond there is. Salma Hayek is awesome and very pretty in this movie, and yes she looks like a natural, casual effortless beauty. I expect when this movie was released Matthew Perry was at the epitome of his career and the zenith of his looks! It's a good watch people. I mean you won't waste your time watching this sometimes things may get predictable but I suggest you go with it...

    each time that I watch it. There's some charm about it that draws me in. I love the chemistry between the actors. I like the music and the scenes are heartfelt, but also make you laugh at times. I think the definition of a good movie is when it evokes an emotion from you then transform that emotion in a split second. I will be crying from happiness then a joke will pop up or something and in the next second I'm laughing. So I recommend anyone to rent this movie if they are looking for a perfect romantic comedy. I guess this movie is like my romantic guilty pleasure. I watch it all the time and always will.

    Matthew Perry's films haven't been great successes but for what its worth I think that this is one of his best. Although we see many of the elements of his character from the hit show "Friends" this is what we love to see from Perry and he plays it to perfection. He has good chemistry with Hayek and the overall plot of this film is strong. It has elements of comedy and also a lot of drama which is unusual for a romantic comedy. This element means that Perry is allowed to play some scenes with depth and we see that he is also a fine dramatic actor. Overall although this film was not overly well reviewed and hasn't made much of an impression on the world it is well worth seeking out as it is a good film and showcases the talent of Perry perfectly.

    I was wondering to myself whether a film with one of the male stars of Friends as the lead would be just a naff as anything with Jennifer Aniston, so I spotted this recognisably titled one, from director Andy Tennant (Anna and the King, Hitch). Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex. She tells him that she is pregnant, even though it was a one night stand and he used a condom, which was ineffective, but she is and she wants to keep the baby. Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her "boyfriend". Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again. But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song "Can't Help Falling In Love" playing, which features the lyric "only fools rush in". Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos G&oacute;mez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    I was surprised at how much I liked Fools Rush In. The story is nothing special, and it may drag in spots. But I loved the beautiful cinematography and scenery, the lovely music, the funny and charming screenplay and the direction was surprisingly well handled. The acting from the two leads is excellent. Although his character is very like Chandler from Friends, in terms of the slapstick schtick and the funny lines, Matthew Perry is very effective in his role. Same with Salma Hayek, who is both beautiful and charming here, and shows good chemistry with Perry. Overall, I liked it very much and I wasn't expecting to. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father. The real star of the movie is Las Vegas itself. Shown here is a softer, less known side of Vegas in breathtaking panoramic shots, far from the lights and showgirls, and if the film succeeds anywhere it's in it's ability to immerse and intoxicate the audience with the visuals. Against that backdrop we are treated to a glimpse of a Mexican American family that has a very genuine feel to it. If you mourn the death of the Romantic Comedy and you've exhausted the finer examples of the genre then maybe this one is worth a gamble. Oh yeah Salma Hayek is in it. =)

    Boy {Matthew Perry} meets Girl {Salma Hayek} in a queue for the toilet in a club. Cue both people from different ethnicities ending up in bed together doing something that neither of them have done before. Cue three months later and Girl tuns up in Boys life announcing she's pregnant. Cue emotions pulled apart, a hasty marriage, family strife and many stumbling blocks getting in the way of potential true love. Sound familiar? Not surprisingly this retread of a formula that is as old as the hills has very little originality. The script is desperately dull, the ending is exactly what the world expects and the leads have zero chemistry. That only Perry and Hayek are "names" in the film speaks volumes one feels. You get the sense that what budget there was went on getting the sexy Hayek and Perry {riding on the crest of his Friends wave} to appear. Little flashes of comedy do from time to time surface, and, yes, those who like a cheery cup of the love froth with their rom-coms will feel fuzzy come the end. But really it's a poorly constructed and executed picture, the type that unfortunately seems to come out on a yearly basis. You have been warned, stick with a Cary Grant movie instead. 3/10

    This movie is so clearly not bad. Fools Rush In is one of the better romantic comedies, that's a little known fact. It has really sharp editing, fine directing, good cinematography, really good acting and really good writing. Fools Rush In's editing and story presentation is particularly very strong. Fools Rush In has very rich colors. The writing is natural, genuine. It's really funny, but Fools Rush In is more so good than funny, which is much more of an accomplishment. This movie is all about Alex Whitman and Isabel Fuentes. Matthew Perry is in his best role. Perry's very well-cast and there aren't many actors out of anybody better for the part. He's good for the character and is very lovable. Perry poses as the main star but he's just for show. This is quietly though obviously Salma Hayek's film. She is perfect for the part, perfect. Salma Hayek gives you real heart acting very womanly and comes across as all too sweet. Fools Rush In is a very sweet romantic comedy. It's an easy film to enjoy. I am particularly very fond of Fools Rush In.

    I have read some reviews here, and many people think this is a conventional romantic comedy, it really is not. It is about not being truly happy with your life, and when you discover what you want, being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to keep it. One of these is overcoming your fears. This is what Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), and photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayak), have to do throughout the film. One big issue is the families involved: Alex's are blue blood WASP types, and Isabel's are very traditional Mexicans. It is also Alex's story (far more than Isabel's), and how he really does not like his life, he just does not know any other way. One thing he does, is instead of joining the Country Club set, is studying architecture, at Yale. While going to Yale, is expected for someone like him, taking a difficult major outside the family business was not. So was marrying Cathy Stewart (Suzanne Snyder), who to quote Alex "Was pursuing me since the 3rd Grade." Since the Stewart's were good friends of his parent's (John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real life father) and Jill Clayburgh), it would have been the easy thing simply to marry her, and please them (Although he finds it difficult to stand up to them (Which will create problems later on)). Spoilers Ahead: He and his best friend Jeff (Jon Tenny) are transferred From the New York office where they work, to Las Vegas for a construction project. He then meets Isabel in a Mexican Restaurant and lets her cut the line to the bathroom, and from there they have a one night stand, and then she disappears. Month's later, she shows up pregnant, and he offers to meet her family, so she would not be shamed into being pregnant with someone they never met. When he does, he really likes the big family environment and comments on how his family never eats together. He then offers to any marry her, and he is happy with her, until his parent's show up, and he cannot admit to them Isabel is his wife. From there, the relationship starts to sour, because of family issues, mistrust, lies (She told him she had an miscarriage), and their fears. In one scene Isabel goes to Mexico to visit her great grandmother, and admitted how much she loved Alex, but was afraid of being hurt. They finally agree to get a divorce, but Alex (Now back in New York) is miserable. He runs into a Priest, who tells him "There are signs out there." Pictures of The Grand Canyon, a chihuahua, and a little girl named Isabel, remind him of her, and he does not want the divorce (Although time is running out). So he goes down to Mexico (Where he found out she was), and takes a cheap plane from Mexico City, an old bus, and a mule, to get to her great grandmother's only to find out she was heading back to Las Vegas (He had no idea it was to bear his child, since he did not speak or understand Spanish). He gets there first, and is standing on Hoover Dam, and a huge rainstorm happens and he gets drenched. Finally she is driving and sees him and almost causes an accident. She is mad at him (And more at herself because she lost hope (She broke up with a previous boy friend because a necklace broke which to her was a sign)), then he finds out she is still pregnant, and they both admit they were lying and afraid. Then her water broke, and she is going to have the baby right on the Dam. What really impresses her, is the fact that he would travel all the way to Mexico just for her (He had no idea she was still pregnant). When the baby comes (A girl), Isabel asks "Do you think she will like living in New York City?' Alex says "Not as much as camping in the desert." A key point, because one of Isabel's brother's explained, that her life is here, and she would not be happy anywhere else. Then Isabel said "With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs (A famous New York hot dog)." Alex then says, "Oh no." Isabel says:' What?" Alex says "We're divorced." Of course, that will change when they are married again (This time in a traditional way at The Grand Canyon (Unlike the first time by an Elvis impersonator and without the families there)). I am a huge Salma fan, and she is at her best here. But this is Perry's film, and his scenes are the funny ones: Getting cactus needles in his behind after going camping and landing in a pit of rattlesnakes, and the rain scene. But he is also the one who is willing to do whatever is necessary to have Isabel, and that means leaving his prior life behind, and not only accepting but embracing hers. This is one of my favorite films of all-time. 10/10 stars.

But Alex doesn't see Isabel again until three months later, when he learns she is pregnant. On a whim and prayer, he proposes.

I can imagine the producers saying to Perry on the first day of filming 'just be Chandler, everyone loves Chandler', and that is what he does, not because he has no other range but because the makers know that people of a certain age will relate to him, and see the film because of his success in Friends. And thats wherein the problem lies. The vehicle isn't for Perry, it's for Chandler, and in my opinion, he is the most annoying one from that series. So thank heavens for Hayek, who shows here that she isn't just beautiful, but she can carry a film and make it that little more interesting when shes on screen. The story is amiable enough and quite sweet, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and we will see plenty of them again. It's pretty forgettable stuff, which is a shame, because Hayek is great..

    I was wondering to myself whether a film with one of the male stars of Friends as the lead would be just a naff as anything with Jennifer Aniston, so I spotted this recognisably titled one, from director Andy Tennant (Anna and the King, Hitch). Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex.

Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy.

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work.

They finally agree to get a divorce, but Alex (Now back in New York) is miserable. He runs into a Priest, who tells him "There are signs out there." Pictures of The Grand Canyon, a chihuahua, and a little girl named Isabel, remind him of her, and he does not want the divorce (Although time is running out). So he goes down to Mexico (Where he found out she was), and takes a cheap plane from Mexico City, an old bus, and a mule, to get to her great grandmother's only to find out she was heading back to Las Vegas (He had no idea it was to bear his child, since he did not speak or understand Spanish). He gets there first, and is standing on Hoover Dam, and a huge rainstorm happens and he gets drenched. Finally she is driving and sees him and almost causes an accident. She is mad at him (And more at herself because she lost hope (She broke up with a previous boy friend because a necklace broke which to her was a sign)), then he finds out she is still pregnant, and they both admit they were lying and afraid. Then her water broke, and she is going to have the baby right on the Dam. What really impresses her, is the fact that he would travel all the way to Mexico just for her (He had no idea she was still pregnant). When the baby comes (A girl), Isabel asks "Do you think she will like living in New York City?' Alex says "Not as much as camping in the desert." A key point, because one of Isabel's brother's explained, that her life is here, and she would not be happy anywhere else. Then Isabel said "With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs (A famous New York hot dog)." Alex then says, "Oh no." Isabel says:' What?" Alex says "We're divorced." Of course, that will change when they are married again (This time in a traditional way at The Grand Canyon (Unlike the first time by an Elvis impersonator and without the families there)). I am a huge Salma fan, and she is at her best here. But this is Perry's film, and his scenes are the funny ones: Getting cactus needles in his behind after going camping and landing in a pit of rattlesnakes, and the rain scene. But he is also the one who is willing to do whatever is necessary to have Isabel, and that means leaving his prior life behind, and not only accepting but embracing hers. This is one of my favorite films of all-time. 10/10 stars.

    Alex Whitman is a New Yorker sent to Las Vegas to oversee a construction project. There he meets Isabel, and some serious chemistry brings them together for one night. But Alex doesn't see Isabel again until three months later, when he learns she is pregnant. On a whim and prayer, he proposes. However, there's more to marriage than a Vegas chapel and an Elvis impersonator, as Alex and Isabel soon learn...... I can imagine the producers saying to Perry on the first day of filming 'just be Chandler, everyone loves Chandler', and that is what he does, not because he has no other range but because the makers know that people of a certain age will relate to him, and see the film because of his success in Friends. And thats wherein the problem lies. The vehicle isn't for Perry, it's for Chandler, and in my opinion, he is the most annoying one from that series. So thank heavens for Hayek, who shows here that she isn't just beautiful, but she can carry a film and make it that little more interesting when shes on screen. The story is amiable enough and quite sweet, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and we will see plenty of them again. It's pretty forgettable stuff, which is a shame, because Hayek is great..

    I can't recall movies falling in this genre making huge, big bucks, I can't recall movies falling in this genre being 100% realistic. But, this movie is something maybe people who are in inter cultural marriages can relate to or maybe not. This movie is based on a true story, it's about a one night stand, a pregnancy and how it takes toll on the lives of two people who barely know each other yet share the most complex bond there is. Salma Hayek is awesome and very pretty in this movie, and yes she looks like a natural, casual effortless beauty. I expect when this movie was released Matthew Perry was at the epitome of his career and the zenith of his looks! It's a good watch people. I mean you won't waste your time watching this sometimes things may get predictable but I suggest you go with it...

    each time that I watch it. There's some charm about it that draws me in. I love the chemistry between the actors. I like the music and the scenes are heartfelt, but also make you laugh at times. I think the definition of a good movie is when it evokes an emotion from you then transform that emotion in a split second. I will be crying from happiness then a joke will pop up or something and in the next second I'm laughing. So I recommend anyone to rent this movie if they are looking for a perfect romantic comedy. I guess this movie is like my romantic guilty pleasure. I watch it all the time and always will.

    Matthew Perry's films haven't been great successes but for what its worth I think that this is one of his best. Although we see many of the elements of his character from the hit show "Friends" this is what we love to see from Perry and he plays it to perfection. He has good chemistry with Hayek and the overall plot of this film is strong. It has elements of comedy and also a lot of drama which is unusual for a romantic comedy. This element means that Perry is allowed to play some scenes with depth and we see that he is also a fine dramatic actor. Overall although this film was not overly well reviewed and hasn't made much of an impression on the world it is well worth seeking out as it is a good film and showcases the talent of Perry perfectly.

    I was wondering to myself whether a film with one of the male stars of Friends as the lead would be just a naff as anything with Jennifer Aniston, so I spotted this recognisably titled one, from director Andy Tennant (Anna and the King, Hitch). Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex. She tells him that she is pregnant, even though it was a one night stand and he used a condom, which was ineffective, but she is and she wants to keep the baby. Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her "boyfriend". Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again. But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song "Can't Help Falling In Love" playing, which features the lyric "only fools rush in". Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos G&oacute;mez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!

But I loved the beautiful cinematography and scenery, the lovely music, the funny and charming screenplay and the direction was surprisingly well handled. The acting from the two leads is excellent. Although his character is very like Chandler from Friends, in terms of the slapstick schtick and the funny lines, Matthew Perry is very effective in his role. Same with Salma Hayek, who is both beautiful and charming here, and shows good chemistry with Perry. Overall, I liked it very much and I wasn't expecting to. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father. The real star of the movie is Las Vegas itself. Shown here is a softer, less known side of Vegas in breathtaking panoramic shots, far from the lights and showgirls, and if the film succeeds anywhere it's in it's ability to immerse and intoxicate the audience with the visuals. Against that backdrop we are treated to a glimpse of a Mexican American family that has a very genuine feel to it. If you mourn the death of the Romantic Comedy and you've exhausted the finer examples of the genre then maybe this one is worth a gamble. Oh yeah Salma Hayek is in it. =)

    Boy {Matthew Perry} meets Girl {Salma Hayek} in a queue for the toilet in a club. Cue both people from different ethnicities ending up in bed together doing something that neither of them have done before. Cue three months later and Girl tuns up in Boys life announcing she's pregnant. Cue emotions pulled apart, a hasty marriage, family strife and many stumbling blocks getting in the way of potential true love. Sound familiar? Not surprisingly this retread of a formula that is as old as the hills has very little originality. The script is desperately dull, the ending is exactly what the world expects and the leads have zero chemistry. That only Perry and Hayek are "names" in the film speaks volumes one feels. You get the sense that what budget there was went on getting the sexy Hayek and Perry {riding on the crest of his Friends wave} to appear. Little flashes of comedy do from time to time surface, and, yes, those who like a cheery cup of the love froth with their rom-coms will feel fuzzy come the end. But really it's a poorly constructed and executed picture, the type that unfortunately seems to come out on a yearly basis. You have been warned, stick with a Cary Grant movie instead. 3/10

    This movie is so clearly not bad. Fools Rush In is one of the better romantic comedies, that's a little known fact. It has really sharp editing, fine directing, good cinematography, really good acting and really good writing. Fools Rush In's editing and story presentation is particularly very strong. Fools Rush In has very rich colors. The writing is natural, genuine. It's really funny, but Fools Rush In is more so good than funny, which is much more of an accomplishment. This movie is all about Alex Whitman and Isabel Fuentes. Matthew Perry is in his best role. Perry's very well-cast and there aren't many actors out of anybody better for the part. He's good for the character and is very lovable. Perry poses as the main star but he's just for show. This is quietly though obviously Salma Hayek's film. She is perfect for the part, perfect. Salma Hayek gives you real heart acting very womanly and comes across as all too sweet. Fools Rush In is a very sweet romantic comedy. It's an easy film to enjoy. I am particularly very fond of Fools Rush In.

    Not A Conventional Romantic Comedy

    I have read some reviews here, and many people think this is a conventional romantic comedy, it really is not. It is about not being truly happy with your life, and when you discover what you want, being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to keep it. One of these is overcoming your fears. This is what Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), and photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayak), have to do throughout the film. One big issue is the families involved: Alex's are blue blood WASP types, and Isabel's are very traditional Mexicans. It is also Alex's story (far more than Isabel's), and how he really does not like his life, he just does not know any other way. One thing he does, is instead of joining the Country Club set, is studying architecture, at Yale. While going to Yale, is expected for someone like him, taking a difficult major outside the family business was not. So was marrying Cathy Stewart (Suzanne Snyder), who to quote Alex "Was pursuing me since the 3rd Grade." Since the Stewart's were good friends of his parent's (John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real life father) and Jill Clayburgh), it would have been the easy thing simply to marry her, and please them (Although he finds it difficult to stand up to them (Which will create problems later on)). Spoilers Ahead: He and his best friend Jeff (Jon Tenny) are transferred From the New York office where they work, to Las Vegas for a construction project. He then meets Isabel in a Mexican Restaurant and lets her cut the line to the bathroom, and from there they have a one night stand, and then she disappears. Month's later, she shows up pregnant, and he offers to meet her family, so she would not be shamed into being pregnant with someone they never met. When he does, he really likes the big family environment and comments on how his family never eats together. He then offers to any marry her, and he is happy with her, until his parent's show up, and he cannot admit to them Isabel is his wife. From there, the relationship starts to sour, because of family issues, mistrust, lies (She told him she had an miscarriage), and their fears. In one scene Isabel goes to Mexico to visit her great grandmother, and admitted how much she loved Alex, but was afraid of being hurt. They finally agree to get a divorce, but Alex (Now back in New York) is miserable. He runs into a Priest, who tells him "There are signs out there." Pictures of The Grand Canyon, a chihuahua, and a little girl named Isabel, remind him of her, and he does not want the divorce (Although time is running out). So he goes down to Mexico (Where he found out she was), and takes a cheap plane from Mexico City, an old bus, and a mule, to get to her great grandmother's only to find out she was heading back to Las Vegas (He had no idea it was to bear his child, since he did not speak or understand Spanish). He gets there first, and is standing on Hoover Dam, and a huge rainstorm happens and he gets drenched. Finally she is driving and sees him and almost causes an accident. She is mad at him (And more at herself because she lost hope (She broke up with a previous boy friend because a necklace broke which to her was a sign)), then he finds out she is still pregnant, and they both admit they were lying and afraid. Then her water broke, and she is going to have the baby right on the Dam. What really impresses her, is the fact that he would travel all the way to Mexico just for her (He had no idea she was still pregnant). When the baby comes (A girl), Isabel asks "Do you think she will like living in New York City?' Alex says "Not as much as camping in the desert." A key point, because one of Isabel's brother's explained, that her life is here, and she would not be happy anywhere else. Then Isabel said "With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs (A famous New York hot dog)." Alex then says, "Oh no." Isabel says:' What?" Alex says "We're divorced." Of course, that will change when they are married again (This time in a traditional way at The Grand Canyon (Unlike the first time by an Elvis impersonator and without the families there)). I am a huge Salma fan, and she is at her best here. But this is Perry's film, and his scenes are the funny ones: Getting cactus needles in his behind after going camping and landing in a pit of rattlesnakes, and the rain scene. But he is also the one who is willing to do whatever is necessary to have Isabel, and that means leaving his prior life behind, and not only accepting but embracing hers. This is one of my favorite films of all-time. 10/10 stars.

Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos G&oacute;mez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy.

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father.

He's good for the character and is very lovable. Perry poses as the main star but he's just for show. This is quietly though obviously Salma Hayek's film. She is perfect for the part, perfect. Salma Hayek gives you real heart acting very womanly and comes across as all too sweet. Fools Rush In is a very sweet romantic comedy. It's an easy film to enjoy. I am particularly very fond of Fools Rush In.

    I have read some reviews here, and many people think this is a conventional romantic comedy, it really is not. It is about not being truly happy with your life, and when you discover what you want, being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to keep it. One of these is overcoming your fears. This is what Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), and photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayak), have to do throughout the film. One big issue is the families involved: Alex's are blue blood WASP types, and Isabel's are very traditional Mexicans. It is also Alex's story (far more than Isabel's), and how he really does not like his life, he just does not know any other way. One thing he does, is instead of joining the Country Club set, is studying architecture, at Yale. While going to Yale, is expected for someone like him, taking a difficult major outside the family business was not. So was marrying Cathy Stewart (Suzanne Snyder), who to quote Alex "Was pursuing me since the 3rd Grade." Since the Stewart's were good friends of his parent's (John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real life father) and Jill Clayburgh), it would have been the easy thing simply to marry her, and please them (Although he finds it difficult to stand up to them (Which will create problems later on)). Spoilers Ahead: He and his best friend Jeff (Jon Tenny) are transferred From the New York office where they work, to Las Vegas for a construction project. He then meets Isabel in a Mexican Restaurant and lets her cut the line to the bathroom, and from there they have a one night stand, and then she disappears. Month's later, she shows up pregnant, and he offers to meet her family, so she would not be shamed into being pregnant with someone they never met. When he does, he really likes the big family environment and comments on how his family never eats together. He then offers to any marry her, and he is happy with her, until his parent's show up, and he cannot admit to them Isabel is his wife. From there, the relationship starts to sour, because of family issues, mistrust, lies (She told him she had an miscarriage), and their fears. In one scene Isabel goes to Mexico to visit her great grandmother, and admitted how much she loved Alex, but was afraid of being hurt. They finally agree to get a divorce, but Alex (Now back in New York) is miserable. He runs into a Priest, who tells him "There are signs out there." Pictures of The Grand Canyon, a chihuahua, and a little girl named Isabel, remind him of her, and he does not want the divorce (Although time is running out). So he goes down to Mexico (Where he found out she was), and takes a cheap plane from Mexico City, an old bus, and a mule, to get to her great grandmother's only to find out she was heading back to Las Vegas (He had no idea it was to bear his child, since he did not speak or understand Spanish). He gets there first, and is standing on Hoover Dam, and a huge rainstorm happens and he gets drenched. Finally she is driving and sees him and almost causes an accident. She is mad at him (And more at herself because she lost hope (She broke up with a previous boy friend because a necklace broke which to her was a sign)), then he finds out she is still pregnant, and they both admit they were lying and afraid. Then her water broke, and she is going to have the baby right on the Dam. What really impresses her, is the fact that he would travel all the way to Mexico just for her (He had no idea she was still pregnant). When the baby comes (A girl), Isabel asks "Do you think she will like living in New York City?' Alex says "Not as much as camping in the desert." A key point, because one of Isabel's brother's explained, that her life is here, and she would not be happy anywhere else. Then Isabel said "With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs (A famous New York hot dog)." Alex then says, "Oh no." Isabel says:' What?" Alex says "We're divorced." Of course, that will change when they are married again (This time in a traditional way at The Grand Canyon (Unlike the first time by an Elvis impersonator and without the families there)). I am a huge Salma fan, and she is at her best here. But this is Perry's film, and his scenes are the funny ones: Getting cactus needles in his behind after going camping and landing in a pit of rattlesnakes, and the rain scene. But he is also the one who is willing to do whatever is necessary to have Isabel, and that means leaving his prior life behind, and not only accepting but embracing hers. This is one of my favorite films of all-time. 10/10 stars.

    Alex Whitman is a New Yorker sent to Las Vegas to oversee a construction project. There he meets Isabel, and some serious chemistry brings them together for one night. But Alex doesn't see Isabel again until three months later, when he learns she is pregnant. On a whim and prayer, he proposes. However, there's more to marriage than a Vegas chapel and an Elvis impersonator, as Alex and Isabel soon learn...... I can imagine the producers saying to Perry on the first day of filming 'just be Chandler, everyone loves Chandler', and that is what he does, not because he has no other range but because the makers know that people of a certain age will relate to him, and see the film because of his success in Friends. And thats wherein the problem lies. The vehicle isn't for Perry, it's for Chandler, and in my opinion, he is the most annoying one from that series. So thank heavens for Hayek, who shows here that she isn't just beautiful, but she can carry a film and make it that little more interesting when shes on screen. The story is amiable enough and quite sweet, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and we will see plenty of them again. It's pretty forgettable stuff, which is a shame, because Hayek is great..

    I can't recall movies falling in this genre making huge, big bucks, I can't recall movies falling in this genre being 100% realistic. But, this movie is something maybe people who are in inter cultural marriages can relate to or maybe not. This movie is based on a true story, it's about a one night stand, a pregnancy and how it takes toll on the lives of two people who barely know each other yet share the most complex bond there is. Salma Hayek is awesome and very pretty in this movie, and yes she looks like a natural, casual effortless beauty. I expect when this movie was released Matthew Perry was at the epitome of his career and the zenith of his looks! It's a good watch people. I mean you won't waste your time watching this sometimes things may get predictable but I suggest you go with it...

    each time that I watch it. There's some charm about it that draws me in. I love the chemistry between the actors. I like the music and the scenes are heartfelt, but also make you laugh at times. I think the definition of a good movie is when it evokes an emotion from you then transform that emotion in a split second. I will be crying from happiness then a joke will pop up or something and in the next second I'm laughing. So I recommend anyone to rent this movie if they are looking for a perfect romantic comedy. I guess this movie is like my romantic guilty pleasure. I watch it all the time and always will.

    Matthew Perry's films haven't been great successes but for what its worth I think that this is one of his best. Although we see many of the elements of his character from the hit show "Friends" this is what we love to see from Perry and he plays it to perfection. He has good chemistry with Hayek and the overall plot of this film is strong. It has elements of comedy and also a lot of drama which is unusual for a romantic comedy. This element means that Perry is allowed to play some scenes with depth and we see that he is also a fine dramatic actor. Overall although this film was not overly well reviewed and hasn't made much of an impression on the world it is well worth seeking out as it is a good film and showcases the talent of Perry perfectly.

    I was wondering to myself whether a film with one of the male stars of Friends as the lead would be just a naff as anything with Jennifer Aniston, so I spotted this recognisably titled one, from director Andy Tennant (Anna and the King, Hitch). Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex. She tells him that she is pregnant, even though it was a one night stand and he used a condom, which was ineffective, but she is and she wants to keep the baby. Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her "boyfriend". Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again. But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song "Can't Help Falling In Love" playing, which features the lyric "only fools rush in". Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos G&oacute;mez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    I was surprised at how much I liked Fools Rush In. The story is nothing special, and it may drag in spots. But I loved the beautiful cinematography and scenery, the lovely music, the funny and charming screenplay and the direction was surprisingly well handled. The acting from the two leads is excellent. Although his character is very like Chandler from Friends, in terms of the slapstick schtick and the funny lines, Matthew Perry is very effective in his role. Same with Salma Hayek, who is both beautiful and charming here, and shows good chemistry with Perry. Overall, I liked it very much and I wasn't expecting to. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    When this film was released in 1997 it was a mere footnote and has since virtually disappeared entirely. Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse. The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father. The real star of the movie is Las Vegas itself. Shown here is a softer, less known side of Vegas in breathtaking panoramic shots, far from the lights and showgirls, and if the film succeeds anywhere it's in it's ability to immerse and intoxicate the audience with the visuals. Against that backdrop we are treated to a glimpse of a Mexican American family that has a very genuine feel to it. If you mourn the death of the Romantic Comedy and you've exhausted the finer examples of the genre then maybe this one is worth a gamble. Oh yeah Salma Hayek is in it. =)

    Boy {Matthew Perry} meets Girl {Salma Hayek} in a queue for the toilet in a club. Cue both people from different ethnicities ending up in bed together doing something that neither of them have done before. Cue three months later and Girl tuns up in Boys life announcing she's pregnant. Cue emotions pulled apart, a hasty marriage, family strife and many stumbling blocks getting in the way of potential true love. Sound familiar? Not surprisingly this retread of a formula that is as old as the hills has very little originality. The script is desperately dull, the ending is exactly what the world expects and the leads have zero chemistry. That only Perry and Hayek are "names" in the film speaks volumes one feels. You get the sense that what budget there was went on getting the sexy Hayek and Perry {riding on the crest of his Friends wave} to appear. Little flashes of comedy do from time to time surface, and, yes, those who like a cheery cup of the love froth with their rom-coms will feel fuzzy come the end. But really it's a poorly constructed and executed picture, the type that unfortunately seems to come out on a yearly basis. You have been warned, stick with a Cary Grant movie instead. 3/10
