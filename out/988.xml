    After looking at some of the scores people gave this movie I honestly didn't think it would amount to much. However, after actually watching it I found it to be surprisingly good. Fran Drescher plays "Joy Miller" who is a beautician in New York City. Timothy Dalton is "Boris Pochenko", a brutal tyrant of a small Eastern European country (Slovetzia) who has mistakenly hired Joy to teach his four children. His Prime Minister, "Leonid Kleist" (played by Patrick Malahide), insures that Boris rules with an iron fist. Joy arrives and becomes instrumental in introducing much needed change. More importantly though, she changes Boris for the better as well. Now, while this plot is extremely predictable, the comedy is anything but that as there are many surprises written into the script that are simply hilarious and I think the writer (Todd Graff) deserves a lot of credit for this. Likewise, even though Fran Drescher was nominated for a "Razzie Award" for her performance, I can honestly say that it was totally undeserved. I found her performance to be both witty and refreshing. I also liked the way she and Timothy Dalton worked so well together. The "massage scene" in particular was especially amusing. In closing, I thought this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie and well worth the time spent.

    Hey, like many people, I happen to like "The Nanny". I also like Fran Dresscher in "The Nanny". (I don't think I need to explain this any further. A lot of people like this show.) Once in a while I like to watch light, fun, mindless movies. I suppose this all pretty well explains why I enjoyed "The Beautician and the Beast". Fran plays almost the same familiar role, except instead of Mr Sheffield we have President-for-Life Pochenko of Slovetzia (Tim Dalton). He's an old school dictator and a disciplinarian as a father; however, she eventually captures his heart and gets him to change his ways. His oppressed children love her, of course. Think of Maria and Capt von Trapp. None of it is realistic, but that's part of the movie's charm. It has the same kind of humour as the television show, plus a good deal of gentle ribbing of Slavic countries and dictatorships. I watched the film on TV in Croatia, so I don't think they mind. I see this movie is rated rather poorly here on IMDb.com. It also didn't do well at the box office. Don't let this influence your decision to watch it. If you like "The Nanny", you'll enjoy this movie too.

    Fran Drescher and Timothy Dalton star in this 1997 romance comedy. A beautician finds romance with a Dictator while she helps him and his children. Joy Miller (Drescher) is a beautician from New York who is soon hired to help an Eastern European Dictator, Boris Pochenko (Dalton) with his children. She teaches them history and such, but also helps Boris become a nicer leader. Joy and Boris start getting close with each other and he learns that she's a beautician. When Joy starts meddling into his business affairs, they drift apart, but eventually find their way back to each other. I've always liked this film and Fran and Timothy have good chemistry. I recommend this entertaining film.

    Now what to make of this movie. I have only watched five minutes of the pilot episode of the nanny, as well as the closing minutes of a number of episodes and have decided that I don't particularly like it. The Beautician and the Beast is basically the Nanny made into a movie, with a few things altered. She isn't sacked from a beauty parlour, but is brought into the home of a really rich man (actually an Eastern European dictator) as a nanny. The movie is quite funny in parts but a really do not think much of Fran Dresure (sp?), especially how I heard the comment that her character in this movie is exactly the same as her character in the nanny. This movie makes numerous assumptions about 'decadent American society' in which it destroys. Rather it attacks the eastern European dictatorship and makes America look like a wonderful place. The promiscuous American is destroyed with Fran's character: she is not interested in guys until the right one comes along, and it is obvious that it was going to be Pochenko (Timothy Dalton), and as the movie draws to the close the idealistic Hollywood ideal of love is emphasised in the most sickening way. The movie blatantly has a go at how these communist nations allegedly altered history to suit themselves. Stalin allegedly did this to make him look like he was really close to Lenin when he was not. America subtly does this with their claims that World War 1 started in 1917 and World War II begins in 1942, the years they became involved in both wars. This is done more as a joke than as an attack, because now communist has gone and everybody can live happily in the marvelous freedom that a democracy brings. Yet Fran is extremely cynical about democratic politicians as she quotes "they're politicians, you can't trust them." Beautician and the Beast is really a remake of Sound of Music with the music replaced with comedy. The movie blatantly steals from the original with the clothes made out of sheets. There are a lot of similarities, a nanny coming in to take care of a very powerful man's children. In Sound of Music he was a Nazi commander while in this movie he is a communist dictator. The last interesting thing to note is when Pochenko is addressing the peasants from a balcony. They scream and cheer at his words. He then walks into the building and Joy Miller (Fran Desure) walks out and thrusts her arms into the air and the crowd cheers. This strikes Pochenko with the fact that it is not him that they cheer, but rather anybody who stands there. Fear is thrust onto people whereas respect is earned.

    Fran Drescher, as nasal as ever, is mistaken for a science teacher and is whisked off to an East European country to instruct the 4 children of widower dictator Timothy Dalton. This is definitely a ripoff of the television series The Nanny. Even Phyllis Newman, who briefly appears as her mother, tries to imitate the great Renee Taylor's Sylvia in the television show. I expected Grandma Yetta to come out but that does not occur. The story is basically where our beautician (Fran) softens the heart of the ruthless dictator. He learns about life from Drescher and the two are finding love until a political situation threatens to end all that. The film is routine in nature. To paraphrase the song from the television show: She was a beautician in the borough of Queens. Until a fire broke out in one of those crushing scenes. What was she to do, where was she to go, she was not working? So to Eastern Europe she flew when she was thought to be a teacher. The dictator, the beast, was quite a creature. She had style, she had class, that's why she became his lover.

    I give this movie a 10 because of the tremendous amount of comedy within the dialog, matched with the comic timing skillfully done by Dalton and Drescher. To watch them is like watching Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "I Love Lucy". Especially when Boris (Dalton) speaks in bad sounding English and Joy (Drescher) mimics him. Dalton's transformation from beast to 'prince charming' is, as always, believable. He also gets the laughs and looks yummy at the same time. Fran is also in her element, because in a movie such as this (vs the sitcom 'the Nanny') she gets a chance to show us her serious side--and she is as believable as when she's zinging those classic comic one-liners. The movie also shows off Dalton's ferocious and highly energetic fencing skills, which is another trademark of his. The high tension built up by Dalton is only brought down by Drescher's light-heartedness and wit. It plays out extremely well with more confrontations to come. And, there's no swearing! Laughter is the best medicine to beat the blues. So, I say enjoy the fairy-tale it's meant to be and get ready to laugh out loud. By the by--if you get to watch this movie on DVD, Fran's commentary is a stream of extra laughs!

    'The Beautician and the Beast' follows the line of the immensely 'The Sound of Music' and Drescher's own popular sitcom 'The Nanny'. It has the usual mushiness and fluffiness that other American rom-coms have (although this one is set in Eastern Europe) and it's accompanied by a nice soundtrack. However, what really sets this one apart is the delightfully funny Fran Drescher. Her character is no different from her unique persona as Nanny's Fran Fine but even so, her wit, charisma and comic timing are perfect. Those who find her annoying in 'The Nanny' would most likely hate this movie but for me, this actress makes it somewhat likable. Timothy Dalton as the beautician (just kidding) is quite adequate (his fake accent is hilarious) and both actors share a good chemistry. The rest are just okay, mostly gap fillers. There is nothing path-breaking about this movie but if one is a fan of Ms. Drescher then why not give this a try if you've got nothing else to lose?

    Joy Miller (Fran Drescher) is a night school hair instructor in the New York City area. One evening, the classroom catches on fire and Joy saves the day, hustling everyone out of the building. Her beautiful picture ends up in the local papers. It just so happens that a minister from the eastern European country of Slovetzia is looking for a teacher for the ruler's children and he hires Joy, not realizing that she teaches cosmetology alone. Only after the two of them land in Slovetzia does the truth come out. Never mind, Joy tells the public servant, she will do her best to teach those kids. The country's leader, Boris (Timothy Dalton), however, is a no-nonsense guy who rules his family and his country with an iron fist. Indeed, Slovetzia is depressingly similar to the Soviet Union at its worst. Boris is struck by Joy's charm and beauty but insists there will be no goofing off in the classroom. The children are sweet but one daughter, especially, longs for a bit more freedom. Can Joy bring a touch of democracy and levity to the dismal country? This darling little film will please both fans of romantic comedy and those who love Drescher. If "The Nanny" was your cat's meow, you will adore this film that came out years before, for it is strikingly similar. Indeed, Drescher and Dalton make a dynamite combination and are very pleasing. The rest of the cast is adequately pleasant. The costumes, especially Drescher's, are quite nice and the scenery and ruling palace are lovely. As for the script, it is funny and touching and the direction has energy. Therefore, if you love those comic tales of affection, skip the beauty parlor and head to the video store instead. You can get your hair done another day but you need this little jolt of sunshine, on film, immediately.

    I am Timothy Dalton's self declared #1 fan - and I adore Fran Drescher. When this movie came out I looked SO forward to seeing it as it was a film that was going to allow TImothy to show everyone else how funny he can be and what a multi-dimensional actor he is. I am also a big fan of Fran Drescher! I miss seeing her more often also. She is so beautiful and such a talent - and so very good at being funny. Neither of them disappoint in this movie. They are wonderful! Life is so full of stress, sadness, loss, tragedy now, more light hearted, comedic movies like this are needed sandwiched in to take us away and be entertained in fantasyland for a while. I love action movies and horror movies (the unrealistic ones) but we need more of this type movie thrown in the mix MORE OFTEN. This is a magical, romantic-comedy, fantasy escape - ****someone made mention the country doesn't even really exist - WHO cares the country doesn't really exist??? Neither does Oz, Narnia or MiddleEarth. ****THEN SOMEone was pretty critical of Timothy's accent being very bad; Timothy does nothing bad, including accents. BUT, IF THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T EXIST, HOW CAN YOU KNOW THE ACCENT IS BAD??? I thought it was wonderful. Have you ever tried to make up an accent of a nonexistent country? :o) How long can Joy Miller carry off her charade, and does she keep getting out of ALL the messes she gets herself involved in or does she get caught? Some of TD'S and FD's humorous scenes ARE reminiscent of I Love Lucy, but much better and priceless. You keep wondering when is this cranky guy going to catch on to the truths surrounding him, and what in the world will he do when he does!? There are a few close calls, so to speak (that are hilarious) There is a very lovable chicken in the movie, a surprisingly fine little actor herself, very cute ~ with some adorable scenes. Trust me. Its touching, worrisome at times...and cute, I swear she gets the most precious "expressions". -With all due respect and targeting no one in particular, it seems in our world today many people have become so jaded they can't enjoy a great, light hearted hilarious romantic comedy that is CLEAN, without calling it "cheesy" or "corny". IT IS NEITHER. I choose not to believe in those concepts. People have just gotten so much more afraid to show emotion and care for each other and we need more of that and perhaps more movies like this would unconsciously encourage it. Timothy is at his usual flawless best, playing both "sides" of: the ill tempered dictator, whose ego seems large enough to have its own zip code you can't get to from here; and who thinks things are just hunky dory with "his people", but are they?; to his other self -the gorgeously handsome man,with that deep sexy voice, which is more apparent when he isn't yelling or fussing about something.(And I HAVE to say he is handsome both with mustache and sans mustache). I think the movie is written very well, and when he first starts to become- challenged by Joy Miller's lessons for HIM, and goes out amongst "his people" - well, just wait and see-its truly a priceless, clueless "moment" for him, (We get to watch him as Tim pulls the cluelessness of this guy off SO well, chest puffed up, strutting, smiling and waving as if he does it every day...) And quite a shock for "the people". Fran is terrific and gorgeous too, and I think the pairing of those two was sheer genius and they make a beautiful couple in heart, spirit, and yes,look. I know I was jealous of lucky Fran AND the "mythical couple" and it took me away to that place all women who love romantic stories love to go - where YOU are the female lead character! This is a GREAT MOVIE AND ITS NOT JUST A "CHICK FLICK" EITHER, GUYS - if you like comedy I recommend it to you also and there IS Fran. Kids will like this movie too and I feel it IS of family movie quality.

    I though this was a fun, lighthearted movie. I expected the worst, and was surprised how much I enjoyed it. It was put together well and wasn't boring or slow moving. There were funny moments and comments that I remember still. It started out with a similar premise to the Nanny TV show, but quickly moved beyond it. Fran showed more depth of character and independence in this movie than she did (or was allowed to do) in her TV series. Throughout, she is pretty and sexy and dressed to catch attention. It's pretty much a modern fairy tail, like Cinderella, but it doesn't require much suspension of belief. She moves smoothly to charm all around her, including the audience. Timothy Dalton was OK as the Beast, but it was Fran's movie, and he might have been graciously stepping out of her way.

    Joy Miller (Fran Drescher) is a night school hair instructor in the New York City area. One evening, the classroom catches on fire and Joy saves the day, hustling everyone out of the building. Her beautiful picture ends up in the local papers. It just so happens that a minister from the eastern European country of Slovetzia is looking for a teacher for the ruler's children and he hires Joy, not realizing that she teaches cosmetology alone. Only after the two of them land in Slovetzia does the truth come out. Never mind, Joy tells the public servant, she will do her best to teach those kids. The country's leader, Boris (Timothy Dalton), however, is a no-nonsense guy who rules his family and his country with an iron fist. Indeed, Slovetzia is depressingly similar to the Soviet Union at its worst. Boris is struck by Joy's charm and beauty but insists there will be no goofing off in the classroom. The children are sweet but one daughter, especially, longs for a bit more freedom. Can Joy bring a touch of democracy and levity to the dismal country? This darling little film will please both fans of romantic comedy and those who love Drescher. If "The Nanny" was your cat's meow, you will adore this film that came out years before, for it is strikingly similar. Indeed, Drescher and Dalton make a dynamite combination and are very pleasing. The rest of the cast is adequately pleasant. The costumes, especially Drescher's, are quite nice and the scenery and ruling palace are lovely. As for the script, it is funny and touching and the direction has energy. Therefore, if you love those comic tales of affection, skip the beauty parlor and head to the video store instead. You can get your hair done another day but you need this little jolt of sunshine, on film, immediately.

    I am Timothy Dalton's self declared #1 fan - and I adore Fran Drescher. When this movie came out I looked SO forward to seeing it as it was a film that was going to allow TImothy to show everyone else how funny he can be and what a multi-dimensional actor he is. I am also a big fan of Fran Drescher! I miss seeing her more often also. She is so beautiful and such a talent - and so very good at being funny. Neither of them disappoint in this movie. They are wonderful! Life is so full of stress, sadness, loss, tragedy now, more light hearted, comedic movies like this are needed sandwiched in to take us away and be entertained in fantasyland for a while. I love action movies and horror movies (the unrealistic ones) but we need more of this type movie thrown in the mix MORE OFTEN. This is a magical, romantic-comedy, fantasy escape - ****someone made mention the country doesn't even really exist - WHO cares the country doesn't really exist??? Neither does Oz, Narnia or MiddleEarth. ****THEN SOMEone was pretty critical of Timothy's accent being very bad; Timothy does nothing bad, including accents. BUT, IF THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T EXIST, HOW CAN YOU KNOW THE ACCENT IS BAD??? I thought it was wonderful. Have you ever tried to make up an accent of a nonexistent country? :o) How long can Joy Miller carry off her charade, and does she keep getting out of ALL the messes she gets herself involved in or does she get caught? Some of TD'S and FD's humorous scenes ARE reminiscent of I Love Lucy, but much better and priceless. You keep wondering when is this cranky guy going to catch on to the truths surrounding him, and what in the world will he do when he does!? There are a few close calls, so to speak (that are hilarious) There is a very lovable chicken in the movie, a surprisingly fine little actor herself, very cute ~ with some adorable scenes. Trust me. Its touching, worrisome at times...and cute, I swear she gets the most precious "expressions". -With all due respect and targeting no one in particular, it seems in our world today many people have become so jaded they can't enjoy a great, light hearted hilarious romantic comedy that is CLEAN, without calling it "cheesy" or "corny". IT IS NEITHER. I choose not to believe in those concepts. People have just gotten so much more afraid to show emotion and care for each other and we need more of that and perhaps more movies like this would unconsciously encourage it. Timothy is at his usual flawless best, playing both "sides" of: the ill tempered dictator, whose ego seems large enough to have its own zip code you can't get to from here; and who thinks things are just hunky dory with "his people", but are they?; to his other self -the gorgeously handsome man,with that deep sexy voice, which is more apparent when he isn't yelling or fussing about something.(And I HAVE to say he is handsome both with mustache and sans mustache). I think the movie is written very well, and when he first starts to become- challenged by Joy Miller's lessons for HIM, and goes out amongst "his people" - well, just wait and see-its truly a priceless, clueless "moment" for him, (We get to watch him as Tim pulls the cluelessness of this guy off SO well, chest puffed up, strutting, smiling and waving as if he does it every day...) And quite a shock for "the people". Fran is terrific and gorgeous too, and I think the pairing of those two was sheer genius and they make a beautiful couple in heart, spirit, and yes,look. I know I was jealous of lucky Fran AND the "mythical couple" and it took me away to that place all women who love romantic stories love to go - where YOU are the female lead character! This is a GREAT MOVIE AND ITS NOT JUST A "CHICK FLICK" EITHER, GUYS - if you like comedy I recommend it to you also and there IS Fran. Kids will like this movie too and I feel it IS of family movie quality.

    I though this was a fun, lighthearted movie. I expected the worst, and was surprised how much I enjoyed it. It was put together well and wasn't boring or slow moving. There were funny moments and comments that I remember still. It started out with a similar premise to the Nanny TV show, but quickly moved beyond it. Fran showed more depth of character and independence in this movie than she did (or was allowed to do) in her TV series. Throughout, she is pretty and sexy and dressed to catch attention. It's pretty much a modern fairy tail, like Cinderella, but it doesn't require much suspension of belief. She moves smoothly to charm all around her, including the audience. Timothy Dalton was OK as the Beast, but it was Fran's movie, and he might have been graciously stepping out of her way.

    After looking at some of the scores people gave this movie I honestly didn't think it would amount to much. However, after actually watching it I found it to be surprisingly good. Fran Drescher plays "Joy Miller" who is a beautician in New York City. Timothy Dalton is "Boris Pochenko", a brutal tyrant of a small Eastern European country (Slovetzia) who has mistakenly hired Joy to teach his four children. His Prime Minister, "Leonid Kleist" (played by Patrick Malahide), insures that Boris rules with an iron fist. Joy arrives and becomes instrumental in introducing much needed change. More importantly though, she changes Boris for the better as well. Now, while this plot is extremely predictable, the comedy is anything but that as there are many surprises written into the script that are simply hilarious and I think the writer (Todd Graff) deserves a lot of credit for this. Likewise, even though Fran Drescher was nominated for a "Razzie Award" for her performance, I can honestly say that it was totally undeserved. I found her performance to be both witty and refreshing. I also liked the way she and Timothy Dalton worked so well together. The "massage scene" in particular was especially amusing. In closing, I thought this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie and well worth the time spent.

    Hey, like many people, I happen to like "The Nanny". I also like Fran Dresscher in "The Nanny". (I don't think I need to explain this any further. A lot of people like this show.) Once in a while I like to watch light, fun, mindless movies. I suppose this all pretty well explains why I enjoyed "The Beautician and the Beast". Fran plays almost the same familiar role, except instead of Mr Sheffield we have President-for-Life Pochenko of Slovetzia (Tim Dalton). He's an old school dictator and a disciplinarian as a father; however, she eventually captures his heart and gets him to change his ways. His oppressed children love her, of course. Think of Maria and Capt von Trapp. None of it is realistic, but that's part of the movie's charm. It has the same kind of humour as the television show, plus a good deal of gentle ribbing of Slavic countries and dictatorships. I watched the film on TV in Croatia, so I don't think they mind. I see this movie is rated rather poorly here on IMDb.com. It also didn't do well at the box office. Don't let this influence your decision to watch it. If you like "The Nanny", you'll enjoy this movie too.

    Fran Drescher and Timothy Dalton star in this 1997 romance comedy. A beautician finds romance with a Dictator while she helps him and his children. Joy Miller (Drescher) is a beautician from New York who is soon hired to help an Eastern European Dictator, Boris Pochenko (Dalton) with his children. She teaches them history and such, but also helps Boris become a nicer leader. Joy and Boris start getting close with each other and he learns that she's a beautician. When Joy starts meddling into his business affairs, they drift apart, but eventually find their way back to each other. I've always liked this film and Fran and Timothy have good chemistry. I recommend this entertaining film.

    Now what to make of this movie. I have only watched five minutes of the pilot episode of the nanny, as well as the closing minutes of a number of episodes and have decided that I don't particularly like it. The Beautician and the Beast is basically the Nanny made into a movie, with a few things altered. She isn't sacked from a beauty parlour, but is brought into the home of a really rich man (actually an Eastern European dictator) as a nanny. The movie is quite funny in parts but a really do not think much of Fran Dresure (sp?), especially how I heard the comment that her character in this movie is exactly the same as her character in the nanny. This movie makes numerous assumptions about 'decadent American society' in which it destroys. Rather it attacks the eastern European dictatorship and makes America look like a wonderful place. The promiscuous American is destroyed with Fran's character: she is not interested in guys until the right one comes along, and it is obvious that it was going to be Pochenko (Timothy Dalton), and as the movie draws to the close the idealistic Hollywood ideal of love is emphasised in the most sickening way. The movie blatantly has a go at how these communist nations allegedly altered history to suit themselves. Stalin allegedly did this to make him look like he was really close to Lenin when he was not. America subtly does this with their claims that World War 1 started in 1917 and World War II begins in 1942, the years they became involved in both wars. This is done more as a joke than as an attack, because now communist has gone and everybody can live happily in the marvelous freedom that a democracy brings. Yet Fran is extremely cynical about democratic politicians as she quotes "they're politicians, you can't trust them." Beautician and the Beast is really a remake of Sound of Music with the music replaced with comedy. The movie blatantly steals from the original with the clothes made out of sheets. There are a lot of similarities, a nanny coming in to take care of a very powerful man's children. In Sound of Music he was a Nazi commander while in this movie he is a communist dictator. The last interesting thing to note is when Pochenko is addressing the peasants from a balcony. They scream and cheer at his words. He then walks into the building and Joy Miller (Fran Desure) walks out and thrusts her arms into the air and the crowd cheers. This strikes Pochenko with the fact that it is not him that they cheer, but rather anybody who stands there. Fear is thrust onto people whereas respect is earned.

    Fran Drescher, as nasal as ever, is mistaken for a science teacher and is whisked off to an East European country to instruct the 4 children of widower dictator Timothy Dalton. This is definitely a ripoff of the television series The Nanny. Even Phyllis Newman, who briefly appears as her mother, tries to imitate the great Renee Taylor's Sylvia in the television show. I expected Grandma Yetta to come out but that does not occur. The story is basically where our beautician (Fran) softens the heart of the ruthless dictator. He learns about life from Drescher and the two are finding love until a political situation threatens to end all that. The film is routine in nature. To paraphrase the song from the television show: She was a beautician in the borough of Queens. Until a fire broke out in one of those crushing scenes. What was she to do, where was she to go, she was not working? So to Eastern Europe she flew when she was thought to be a teacher. The dictator, the beast, was quite a creature. She had style, she had class, that's why she became his lover.

    I give this movie a 10 because of the tremendous amount of comedy within the dialog, matched with the comic timing skillfully done by Dalton and Drescher. To watch them is like watching Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "I Love Lucy". Especially when Boris (Dalton) speaks in bad sounding English and Joy (Drescher) mimics him. Dalton's transformation from beast to 'prince charming' is, as always, believable. He also gets the laughs and looks yummy at the same time. Fran is also in her element, because in a movie such as this (vs the sitcom 'the Nanny') she gets a chance to show us her serious side--and she is as believable as when she's zinging those classic comic one-liners. The movie also shows off Dalton's ferocious and highly energetic fencing skills, which is another trademark of his. The high tension built up by Dalton is only brought down by Drescher's light-heartedness and wit. It plays out extremely well with more confrontations to come. And, there's no swearing! Laughter is the best medicine to beat the blues. So, I say enjoy the fairy-tale it's meant to be and get ready to laugh out loud. By the by--if you get to watch this movie on DVD, Fran's commentary is a stream of extra laughs!

    'The Beautician and the Beast' follows the line of the immensely 'The Sound of Music' and Drescher's own popular sitcom 'The Nanny'. It has the usual mushiness and fluffiness that other American rom-coms have (although this one is set in Eastern Europe) and it's accompanied by a nice soundtrack. However, what really sets this one apart is the delightfully funny Fran Drescher. Her character is no different from her unique persona as Nanny's Fran Fine but even so, her wit, charisma and comic timing are perfect. Those who find her annoying in 'The Nanny' would most likely hate this movie but for me, this actress makes it somewhat likable. Timothy Dalton as the beautician (just kidding) is quite adequate (his fake accent is hilarious) and both actors share a good chemistry. The rest are just okay, mostly gap fillers. There is nothing path-breaking about this movie but if one is a fan of Ms. Drescher then why not give this a try if you've got nothing else to lose?

    Fran Drescher, as nasal as ever, is mistaken for a science teacher and is whisked off to an East European country to instruct the 4 children of widower dictator Timothy Dalton. This is definitely a ripoff of the television series The Nanny. Even Phyllis Newman, who briefly appears as her mother, tries to imitate the great Renee Taylor's Sylvia in the television show. I expected Grandma Yetta to come out but that does not occur. The story is basically where our beautician (Fran) softens the heart of the ruthless dictator. He learns about life from Drescher and the two are finding love until a political situation threatens to end all that. The film is routine in nature. To paraphrase the song from the television show: She was a beautician in the borough of Queens. Until a fire broke out in one of those crushing scenes. What was she to do, where was she to go, she was not working? So to Eastern Europe she flew when she was thought to be a teacher. The dictator, the beast, was quite a creature. She had style, she had class, that's why she became his lover.

    I give this movie a 10 because of the tremendous amount of comedy within the dialog, matched with the comic timing skillfully done by Dalton and Drescher. To watch them is like watching Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "I Love Lucy". Especially when Boris (Dalton) speaks in bad sounding English and Joy (Drescher) mimics him. Dalton's transformation from beast to 'prince charming' is, as always, believable. He also gets the laughs and looks yummy at the same time. Fran is also in her element, because in a movie such as this (vs the sitcom 'the Nanny') she gets a chance to show us her serious side--and she is as believable as when she's zinging those classic comic one-liners. The movie also shows off Dalton's ferocious and highly energetic fencing skills, which is another trademark of his. The high tension built up by Dalton is only brought down by Drescher's light-heartedness and wit. It plays out extremely well with more confrontations to come. And, there's no swearing! Laughter is the best medicine to beat the blues. So, I say enjoy the fairy-tale it's meant to be and get ready to laugh out loud. By the by--if you get to watch this movie on DVD, Fran's commentary is a stream of extra laughs!

    'The Beautician and the Beast' follows the line of the immensely 'The Sound of Music' and Drescher's own popular sitcom 'The Nanny'. It has the usual mushiness and fluffiness that other American rom-coms have (although this one is set in Eastern Europe) and it's accompanied by a nice soundtrack. However, what really sets this one apart is the delightfully funny Fran Drescher. Her character is no different from her unique persona as Nanny's Fran Fine but even so, her wit, charisma and comic timing are perfect. Those who find her annoying in 'The Nanny' would most likely hate this movie but for me, this actress makes it somewhat likable. Timothy Dalton as the beautician (just kidding) is quite adequate (his fake accent is hilarious) and both actors share a good chemistry. The rest are just okay, mostly gap fillers. There is nothing path-breaking about this movie but if one is a fan of Ms. Drescher then why not give this a try if you've got nothing else to lose?

    Joy Miller (Fran Drescher) is a night school hair instructor in the New York City area. One evening, the classroom catches on fire and Joy saves the day, hustling everyone out of the building. Her beautiful picture ends up in the local papers. It just so happens that a minister from the eastern European country of Slovetzia is looking for a teacher for the ruler's children and he hires Joy, not realizing that she teaches cosmetology alone. Only after the two of them land in Slovetzia does the truth come out. Never mind, Joy tells the public servant, she will do her best to teach those kids. The country's leader, Boris (Timothy Dalton), however, is a no-nonsense guy who rules his family and his country with an iron fist. Indeed, Slovetzia is depressingly similar to the Soviet Union at its worst. Boris is struck by Joy's charm and beauty but insists there will be no goofing off in the classroom. The children are sweet but one daughter, especially, longs for a bit more freedom. Can Joy bring a touch of democracy and levity to the dismal country? This darling little film will please both fans of romantic comedy and those who love Drescher. If "The Nanny" was your cat's meow, you will adore this film that came out years before, for it is strikingly similar. Indeed, Drescher and Dalton make a dynamite combination and are very pleasing. The rest of the cast is adequately pleasant. The costumes, especially Drescher's, are quite nice and the scenery and ruling palace are lovely. As for the script, it is funny and touching and the direction has energy. Therefore, if you love those comic tales of affection, skip the beauty parlor and head to the video store instead. You can get your hair done another day but you need this little jolt of sunshine, on film, immediately.

    I am Timothy Dalton's self declared #1 fan - and I adore Fran Drescher. When this movie came out I looked SO forward to seeing it as it was a film that was going to allow TImothy to show everyone else how funny he can be and what a multi-dimensional actor he is. I am also a big fan of Fran Drescher! I miss seeing her more often also. She is so beautiful and such a talent - and so very good at being funny. Neither of them disappoint in this movie. They are wonderful! Life is so full of stress, sadness, loss, tragedy now, more light hearted, comedic movies like this are needed sandwiched in to take us away and be entertained in fantasyland for a while. I love action movies and horror movies (the unrealistic ones) but we need more of this type movie thrown in the mix MORE OFTEN. This is a magical, romantic-comedy, fantasy escape - ****someone made mention the country doesn't even really exist - WHO cares the country doesn't really exist??? Neither does Oz, Narnia or MiddleEarth. ****THEN SOMEone was pretty critical of Timothy's accent being very bad; Timothy does nothing bad, including accents. BUT, IF THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T EXIST, HOW CAN YOU KNOW THE ACCENT IS BAD??? I thought it was wonderful. Have you ever tried to make up an accent of a nonexistent country? :o) How long can Joy Miller carry off her charade, and does she keep getting out of ALL the messes she gets herself involved in or does she get caught? Some of TD'S and FD's humorous scenes ARE reminiscent of I Love Lucy, but much better and priceless. You keep wondering when is this cranky guy going to catch on to the truths surrounding him, and what in the world will he do when he does!? There are a few close calls, so to speak (that are hilarious) There is a very lovable chicken in the movie, a surprisingly fine little actor herself, very cute ~ with some adorable scenes. Trust me. Its touching, worrisome at times...and cute, I swear she gets the most precious "expressions". -With all due respect and targeting no one in particular, it seems in our world today many people have become so jaded they can't enjoy a great, light hearted hilarious romantic comedy that is CLEAN, without calling it "cheesy" or "corny". IT IS NEITHER. I choose not to believe in those concepts. People have just gotten so much more afraid to show emotion and care for each other and we need more of that and perhaps more movies like this would unconsciously encourage it. Timothy is at his usual flawless best, playing both "sides" of: the ill tempered dictator, whose ego seems large enough to have its own zip code you can't get to from here; and who thinks things are just hunky dory with "his people", but are they?; to his other self -the gorgeously handsome man,with that deep sexy voice, which is more apparent when he isn't yelling or fussing about something.(And I HAVE to say he is handsome both with mustache and sans mustache). I think the movie is written very well, and when he first starts to become- challenged by Joy Miller's lessons for HIM, and goes out amongst "his people" - well, just wait and see-its truly a priceless, clueless "moment" for him, (We get to watch him as Tim pulls the cluelessness of this guy off SO well, chest puffed up, strutting, smiling and waving as if he does it every day...) And quite a shock for "the people". Fran is terrific and gorgeous too, and I think the pairing of those two was sheer genius and they make a beautiful couple in heart, spirit, and yes,look. I know I was jealous of lucky Fran AND the "mythical couple" and it took me away to that place all women who love romantic stories love to go - where YOU are the female lead character! This is a GREAT MOVIE AND ITS NOT JUST A "CHICK FLICK" EITHER, GUYS - if you like comedy I recommend it to you also and there IS Fran. Kids will like this movie too and I feel it IS of family movie quality.

    I though this was a fun, lighthearted movie. I expected the worst, and was surprised how much I enjoyed it. It was put together well and wasn't boring or slow moving. There were funny moments and comments that I remember still. It started out with a similar premise to the Nanny TV show, but quickly moved beyond it. Fran showed more depth of character and independence in this movie than she did (or was allowed to do) in her TV series. Throughout, she is pretty and sexy and dressed to catch attention. It's pretty much a modern fairy tail, like Cinderella, but it doesn't require much suspension of belief. She moves smoothly to charm all around her, including the audience. Timothy Dalton was OK as the Beast, but it was Fran's movie, and he might have been graciously stepping out of her way.

    After looking at some of the scores people gave this movie I honestly didn't think it would amount to much. However, after actually watching it I found it to be surprisingly good. Fran Drescher plays "Joy Miller" who is a beautician in New York City. Timothy Dalton is "Boris Pochenko", a brutal tyrant of a small Eastern European country (Slovetzia) who has mistakenly hired Joy to teach his four children. His Prime Minister, "Leonid Kleist" (played by Patrick Malahide), insures that Boris rules with an iron fist. Joy arrives and becomes instrumental in introducing much needed change. More importantly though, she changes Boris for the better as well. Now, while this plot is extremely predictable, the comedy is anything but that as there are many surprises written into the script that are simply hilarious and I think the writer (Todd Graff) deserves a lot of credit for this. Likewise, even though Fran Drescher was nominated for a "Razzie Award" for her performance, I can honestly say that it was totally undeserved. I found her performance to be both witty and refreshing. I also liked the way she and Timothy Dalton worked so well together. The "massage scene" in particular was especially amusing. In closing, I thought this was a thoroughly enjoyable movie and well worth the time spent.

    Hey, like many people, I happen to like "The Nanny". I also like Fran Dresscher in "The Nanny". (I don't think I need to explain this any further. A lot of people like this show.) Once in a while I like to watch light, fun, mindless movies. I suppose this all pretty well explains why I enjoyed "The Beautician and the Beast". Fran plays almost the same familiar role, except instead of Mr Sheffield we have President-for-Life Pochenko of Slovetzia (Tim Dalton). He's an old school dictator and a disciplinarian as a father; however, she eventually captures his heart and gets him to change his ways. His oppressed children love her, of course. Think of Maria and Capt von Trapp. None of it is realistic, but that's part of the movie's charm. It has the same kind of humour as the television show, plus a good deal of gentle ribbing of Slavic countries and dictatorships. I watched the film on TV in Croatia, so I don't think they mind. I see this movie is rated rather poorly here on IMDb.com. It also didn't do well at the box office. Don't let this influence your decision to watch it. If you like "The Nanny", you'll enjoy this movie too.

    Fran Drescher and Timothy Dalton star in this 1997 romance comedy. A beautician finds romance with a Dictator while she helps him and his children. Joy Miller (Drescher) is a beautician from New York who is soon hired to help an Eastern European Dictator, Boris Pochenko (Dalton) with his children. She teaches them history and such, but also helps Boris become a nicer leader. Joy and Boris start getting close with each other and he learns that she's a beautician. When Joy starts meddling into his business affairs, they drift apart, but eventually find their way back to each other. I've always liked this film and Fran and Timothy have good chemistry. I recommend this entertaining film.

    Now what to make of this movie. I have only watched five minutes of the pilot episode of the nanny, as well as the closing minutes of a number of episodes and have decided that I don't particularly like it. The Beautician and the Beast is basically the Nanny made into a movie, with a few things altered. She isn't sacked from a beauty parlour, but is brought into the home of a really rich man (actually an Eastern European dictator) as a nanny. The movie is quite funny in parts but a really do not think much of Fran Dresure (sp?), especially how I heard the comment that her character in this movie is exactly the same as her character in the nanny. This movie makes numerous assumptions about 'decadent American society' in which it destroys. Rather it attacks the eastern European dictatorship and makes America look like a wonderful place. The promiscuous American is destroyed with Fran's character: she is not interested in guys until the right one comes along, and it is obvious that it was going to be Pochenko (Timothy Dalton), and as the movie draws to the close the idealistic Hollywood ideal of love is emphasised in the most sickening way. The movie blatantly has a go at how these communist nations allegedly altered history to suit themselves. Stalin allegedly did this to make him look like he was really close to Lenin when he was not. America subtly does this with their claims that World War 1 started in 1917 and World War II begins in 1942, the years they became involved in both wars. This is done more as a joke than as an attack, because now communist has gone and everybody can live happily in the marvelous freedom that a democracy brings. Yet Fran is extremely cynical about democratic politicians as she quotes "they're politicians, you can't trust them." Beautician and the Beast is really a remake of Sound of Music with the music replaced with comedy. The movie blatantly steals from the original with the clothes made out of sheets. There are a lot of similarities, a nanny coming in to take care of a very powerful man's children. In Sound of Music he was a Nazi commander while in this movie he is a communist dictator. The last interesting thing to note is when Pochenko is addressing the peasants from a balcony. They scream and cheer at his words. He then walks into the building and Joy Miller (Fran Desure) walks out and thrusts her arms into the air and the crowd cheers. This strikes Pochenko with the fact that it is not him that they cheer, but rather anybody who stands there. Fear is thrust onto people whereas respect is earned.
