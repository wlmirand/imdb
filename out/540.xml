    One neat way to find out about a certain movie is to go on Youtube and watch a movie review show. This movie, it just so happens, I found out about thanks to the show "Movie Night", a show on the said website from the same user who made the popular show "Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?", and both I find to be very good shows that I recommend you watch. Anyway, let's not waste any more time over Movie Night and get on with the review. This movie, to say the very least, is convoluted. I say convoluted because the relationship between John and Charlie is never stable considering how much time they spend together on the screen. I also say convoluted because the plot of the movie is all over the place. Sure, I get the Money Train idea and that all the revenue from the metro system of New York is transported by train to a company of greedy psycho cops. I get that this lady named Grace Santiago, played by none other than Jennifer Lopez, comes into the movie and plays into the plights of both John and Charlie, not to mention that she apparently is supposed to show her full skin on New Year's Eve in the movie. I even get that the Money Train would affect everybody who plays a part in the film. However, the way the movie presents itself does not make the movie fit very well, even though I couldn't help but smile at some tidbits here and there. Therefore, everything about the movie left me rather mixed as to what the hell was going on. The character development was nothing new here, and the characters were very hard to respect because all they ever do is do the same thing over and over again in different ways. Charlie is a screw-up, John is a conservative trying to get his life straight, Grace is trying to be the aggressive cop, and the boss is trying to threaten everybody while trying to remind everybody that he is the God of all police officers. None of this really worked well for me because that means everybody was too static for any major changes, even though some, and ONLY some, of the dialogue can actually be considered realistic enough to be repeated. Lastly, I want to talk about the premise. Train robberies have been executed better in both stuff before and after the movie came out. However, it doesn't mean that it was the absolute worst either. It did do enough to keep me in my seat even though it was 1-3 hours after midnight, and it didn't have the stupidity that was unfortunately copied by the 2010 movie "The Other Guys", so I actually watched the whole thing. However, serious work needed to be done with the script that was never accomplished. (November 19th, 2011) Grade: E (4.4/10 Rating)

    This movie is mediocre at best.. My biggest point here is that it seems like they were trying to "cash in" on the Lethal Weapon format, buddy cop, white guy / black guy, straight shooter, crazy guy.. Plot is paper thin and seems like a total rip off of the success of this format that worked almost 10 years prior. Just a thought.. They also seem to have tried to opt for the same soundtrack feel. It actually took me a minute to realize that it really is Jennifer Lopez in the movie. I recognized her voice immediately but she looks so much different than she does now or in movies that followed this one. AMC has it as part of "the new classics" but I have to disagree. Think there are plenty of other films that would be much better suited for this category. Overall its not unwatchable but, not really sold on watching it again..

    In this widely anticipated sequel to the original, our favorite multicolored crime fighting duo returns, in "White Men Can't Jump Two: The Great Train Robbery". In this adventure, our heroes must use their basketball and police skills to defeat an evil New York City train conductor with mob ties. Billy decides to dump Gloria for a chance with her much more attractive cousin, Jennifer Lopez, but Sidney is after her too. The two end up settling the dispute with a game of one on one, and Sidney wins (surprise!). As the winner, Sidney gets to have sex with Jennifer Lopez, while Billy is beaten senseless by mobsters. Billy feels betrayed by his brother from another mother, leading him on a drinking binge that leaves him incapable of performing his police duties during a subway arsonist attack. Unfortunately, Jennifer Lopez is consumed in the fiery blaze. Sidney blames Billy for the tragedy, and fisticuffs ensue. Sidney's legs are badly injured in the brawl, rendering him incapable of dunking. Our heroes forgive each other and reunite to play an epic game of two on two (NBA JAM style) against the arsonist and the train conductor. The contest is intense and physical. The arsonist catches fire from the perimeter, raining down fiery threes. With Sidney's weakened legs and Billy's whiteness, our heroes must rely on their shooting skills to stay competitive. The bad guys are ruthless with their dirty play, and Sidney and the arsonist end up fighting to the death. The arsonist soaks Sidney with gasoline and is about to throw his lighter at him, but Sidney lights him on fire with a magic fire stick then hits him with a train. Sidney then roundhouse kicks him through a plate glass window for good measure. The arsonist dies, but Sidney is issued a flagrant II for excessive contact to the head/neck with a train, and ejected from the game. In the end, its Billy vs the mob conductor, one on one. Billy dunks over the conductor to seal the victory, proving once and for all again, that white men really can jump. Then the mob conductor is brought to justice, and our heroes make away with millions in mob cash.

    If you are seeking an exciting, dramatic movie, with everything, including the kitchen sink thrown in, you've found it. This story revolves around a special transit vehicle called the " Money Train. " The armored subway car itself belong to the New York Transit authority and is overseen by Police Chief Donald Paterson (Robert Blake). Although there are many policemen assigned to the Train units, or subway, only two are causing Paterson to become annoyed with their behavior. Officer John and his partner Charlie (Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson) are two disgruntled police officers who have discovered their chief cares more about his train and its on-time schedule, than for the public safety. With their careers all but finished, the two cops plan to rob the train. Both have reasons, but is further complicated when the two half-brothers began squabbling over their beautiful new partner Officer Grace Santiago (Jennifer Lopez). While the two brothers bicker and complain, serious problems like, muggings, pick-pockets and a pyromaniac called 'The Torch" (Chris Cooper) is causing major concerns. The movie is dosed liberally with fists fights, speed chases and explosions of the third kind, enough to called this movie dramatically exciting. Woody Harrelson gives a special tour De force but is equally confronted by Robert Blake's movie presence. This film is guaranteed to produce excitement and an adrenaline rush as audiences are subjected to the glorious trills of a run-away-train. Excellent viewing. ****

    While this film is several years old now, it is still not too bad to watch when it shows up on network TV. At the time it came out, both Woody Harrison and Wesly Snipes were HUGE box office draws..so they put them both together in a film..expecting magic to happen. It wasn't a amazing memorable film though. Fun..yes...parts were kind of laughable. The idea of them being "brothers" of sorts was cool too. They aren't perfect people with perfect lives..the flaws were quite clear..but we like them anyway. Adding Robert Blake was great as well. His tightly wound character looked like he could explode at any moment. It makes us wonder about how warped other parts of his life might be. I did think having Jennifer Lopez on board as a female cop/love interest was a little too much. She was just coming onto the scene as a performer..and it shows here...although not much has improved about her acting skills over the years...she needs to stick with music in my opinion.Did we need to be reminded she was a woman AND of ethnic decent too? The part could have been played by anyone...or simply not been added at all. I guess she was more or less eye candy here. I think my favorite part was the ending...when they had rolled the train..and were confronted by Robert Blakes extremely enraged character in the subway. After all they had been through...they still could stay cool enough to handle in with one swift and direct punch...which he dearly deserved. They end up getting away with the crime..which was wrong..yet..right too. Did they deserve all the money? Maybe. The fact they screwed the system and got away with it? Awesome.

    The film starts out like all those other clich&eacute;d movies and then twenty minutes later it gets worse. The script is poorly written, the music is tedious (this whole film is), and Joseph Ruben is a sh*tty director. The only good film he made is The Forgotten and all those others are good movies to make you sleep if you are insomniac. To waste ten bucks on this film at the cinemas is like insulting your mother then taking it back and slapping yourself for being stupid. And who can forget the horrible acting from nearly everyone, including Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake, and they suck because it seemed like they were auditioning rather than giving a good performance. This film should definitely not be on your list because I can guarantee you that it's a waste of time and money. Jennifer Lopez is the baddest actor to have ever been born because she acts like a rookie who is acting in her first movie and her gross laugh in one of the scenes embarrassed me. The story is weak and clich&eacute;d, no thanks to you Doug Richardson, but most of all it's predictable and you know what the outcome is going to be. I lost respect for Woody Harrelson, who was perfect in Natural Born Killers, because he acts Cr@p and why did he sign up for this movie in the first place? Guess, he must have been poor or something? Robert Blake overreacts lots of times and that is a downside to his acting career. If you have nothing better to do and are counting on watching Money Train then build a sandcastle instead. Two foster brothers, one white and one black, work as transit cops at a local subway station. One has a good life, but the other one has to owe money to some loan shark. He has to pay fifteen grand or his brother is going to die. He has to hijack a money train in order to get the money and secure his brothers life. Working with a hot woman cop, his brother, he has to succeed and nor get caught by a subway owner, Donald Patterson. The action is not all bad but does get boring after a while. To stop yourself from switching off the TV make sure you have some popcorn and friends to share this boring experience with them. I strongly agree with anyone that's is against this film. The film is short, thank God for that, but it seems like it is longer than a millennium. I can go on forever about how bad this film is but I like short and interesting reviews, so I hope this review is both of those. 5/10 - Yuck!

    I don't know what's the film critics' problem with that movie. It is cool job. Film stars Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson which also starred in 1993 hit film "White Men Can't Jump", but that one is not just comedy. It is an action/comedy film which also stars Jennifer Lopez. It is true that plot is non-linear and film have not a point but it's cool Christmas movie. Wesley Snipes has some well done fight scenes, Woody Harrelson is the main reason of the film's humor. I guess one critic said right about that movie, it has everything we asked from an action movie, not a great plot or great dialogs but it has some great action/martial arts scenes and some hilarious moment, it's not kind of a Jackie Chan movie but it's still good. If we return to Jennifer Lopez, her acting was awful but she was just hot and let us forget her awful acting job in a scene where Wesley Snipes banged her, but the boxing scene between them was also good. I loved their chemistry. So, watch these movie! It is a typical action film with some funny moments, great actors (Wesley and Woody), cool action scenes and hot Jennifer Lopez but don't wait any point or even a plot.

    I recall a review about this movie where the critic was so furious saying things like "Where is the train ?", "This is one of the worst train movies!" while he was somehow missing the point, I think he wasn't completely wrong. Actually this climactic sequence looks confused move since the train's heist is nothing but sudden third act's plot not the whole movie and not related to what seemed the basic duel (the subway's burner) which ends strangely earlier. So, with the misleading title you've got to feel disappointed or at least muddled, repining "this is not a train movie" and it is, but you're the last to know ! And yes, some of the bosses are megalomaniac asses, or psychos anyway, but still making the money train's manager as the story's villain wasn't that right or believable especially with his behaviors near the end. Plus that end which wasn't as simple as what this kind of straight action used to present, being for many people as unethical. Yet I have to defend this as originally it's a story about the love between 2, totally different, brothers where one eventually wins love and the other wins well.. money.. dirty money, just to assure the difference between them both as one good cop and one forever hustler whom their argument has no end. (Joseph Ruben) is the man who can make attractive visual work yet nearly always with not attractive scripts ! He's a very good director but surely not the best when it comes to feeling anything wrong with the writing he deals with. So not many times he got scripts as smart as his direction.. and that's the tragedy ! Though, it's a fair action with great cast. Definitely this is better than (Wesley Snipes & Woody Harrelson)'s last movie (White Men Can't Jump) which's not up to this one's lovely time, let alone being one of the silliest movies ever. (Harrelson) did it so well as a childish loser. (Snipes) was charismatic and performed some of the most memorable fights. And it's enough enjoyment to watch a young brunet (Jennifer Lopez). All the elements (the cinematography, editing, and of course the music) was solid maybe more than the main story. Another side of the movie's misfortune is that it came in the year of 1995 where movies by the names of (Die Hard with a Vengeance), (Bad Boys), (Assassins), (Heat), (Se7en), (Braveheart) were produced. Tough I know. Especially with the more successful results from the box office, the critics, or both. But whatever.. I like (Money Train). I think if you forgot about it as a train movie or heist one you'd discover that it's a fun ride with some well-made action, J-lo too and happy end a la' Hollywood where everybody wins and the evil guy goes to hell. Simply wouldn't you like to destroy your pity work, hit your lunatic boss on the jaw, get free money AND get away with it ? Don't answer this.. Just re-watch the movie !

    Money Train is set in New York where Christmas is fast approaching, subway decoy squad cop Charlie (Woody Harrelson) owes $15,000 of gambling debts to Mr. Brown (Scott Sowers) a very unpleasant mobster. Brown wants his money or he'll hurt him, Carlie's foster brother & fellow New York subway decoy squad cop John (Wesley Snipes) gives him the $15,000 but Charlie loses it. If that wasn't bad enough after a cock-up at work both Charlie & John are sacked by their heartless boss Chief Donald Patterson (Robert Blake), out of options Charlie decides to rob the money train that travels from station to station collecting the revenue... Directed by Joseph Ruben this big budget comedy thriller has a pretty bad reputation but I have to say I quite liked it for what it was. The script by Doug Richardson & David Loughery initially sounds like a straight heist film in the vein of The Italian Job (1969) or The First Great Train Robbery (1979) but the majority of the film feels much more like a buddy buddy mismatched partner thriller, the signs are there for all to see. The mismatched partners with one black & one white which leads to all sorts of amusing racial gags, the fact they are both on the edge & have personal issues but are basically good guy's, there's a pointless romantic subplot & there's several bad guy's that they bring down. There are lots of dialogue scenes all of which seem to cram as many 'F' swear words in as possible, the subplots with Jennifer Lopez & the Torch villain are not needed, Charlie's gambling debts are all but forgotten about by the end & there are scene that are very hard to believe. A cop turning up drunk for work for instance is instant dismissal, starting a fight with your fellow police officers would also get you the sack & there's just not much factual accuracy here. Having said that I quite liked it, I did think certain parts of it were amusing, some of the one-liners & dialogue worked, there's are some impressive fights & a cool train crash at the end although the actually robbery isn't that clever or well thought out. The character's are a mixed bag, Charlie & John are likable but it's them who decided to rob the train in the first place, it's them who initially put other passengers lives at risk not Patterson, then when they get away with it we are supposed to happy for them because even though what happened was their doing, they have stolen money & caused a huge crash & immense damage. Director Ruben does alright, I must admit I think the opening titles are very nice to look at as there are alternating aerial shots of a neon lit New York & some moody scenes of a festive New York going about it's business. There's not much action until the end, a few motorbike stunts & a few fights is about it but they are good nicely violent fights though. The out of control train scenes at the end look good although the final crash is obviously a model. The pace is uneven, until the last forty odd minutes it's a fairly slow film but it did keep my interest with some funny dialogue & a fairly engaging story. With a supposed budget of about $68,000,000 Money Train was an absolute disaster at the box-office for Columbia Pictures, the film opened at number 4 at the end of 1995 to a first weekend gross of just over $10 million as it went up against Toy Story (1995), Goldeneye (1995) & Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) all of which opened at or around the same time as Money Train which tanked & ended it's theatrical run with a paltry $35 million. Ouch. The acting is alright with Snipes & Harrelson putting in likable performances while Jennifer Lopez is as awful as ever & luckily she has no more than a cameo role & as such doesn't ruin things that much. Money Train was a disaster at the box-office, it's generally disliked by both critics & the public but I have to say I quite liked it, it isn't any sort of masterpiece but it just about kept my interest & came away from it feeling entertained & feeling I had fun. Worth a watch if you can watch it on telly for free.

    In this widely anticipated sequel to the original, our favorite multicolored crime fighting duo returns, in "White Men Can't Jump Two: The Great Train Robbery". In this adventure, our heroes must use their basketball and police skills to defeat an evil New York City train conductor with mob ties. Billy decides to dump Gloria for a chance with her much more attractive cousin, Jennifer Lopez, but Sidney is after her too. The two end up settling the dispute with a game of one on one, and Sidney wins (surprise!). As the winner, Sidney gets to have sex with Jennifer Lopez, while Billy is beaten senseless by mobsters. Billy feels betrayed by his brother from another mother, leading him on a drinking binge that leaves him incapable of performing his police duties during a subway arsonist attack. Unfortunately, Jennifer Lopez is consumed in the fiery blaze. Sidney blames Billy for the tragedy, and fisticuffs ensue. Sidney's legs are badly injured in the brawl, rendering him incapable of dunking. Our heroes forgive each other and reunite to play an epic game of two on two (NBA JAM style) against the arsonist and the train conductor. The contest is intense and physical. The arsonist catches fire from the perimeter, raining down fiery threes. With Sidney's weakened legs and Billy's whiteness, our heroes must rely on their shooting skills to stay competitive. The bad guys are ruthless with their dirty play, and Sidney and the arsonist end up fighting to the death. The arsonist soaks Sidney with gasoline and is about to throw his lighter at him, but Sidney lights him on fire with a magic fire stick then hits him with a train. Sidney then roundhouse kicks him through a plate glass window for good measure. The arsonist dies, but Sidney is issued a flagrant II for excessive contact to the head/neck with a train, and ejected from the game. In the end, its Billy vs the mob conductor, one on one. Billy dunks over the conductor to seal the victory, proving once and for all again, that white men really can jump. Then the mob conductor is brought to justice, and our heroes make away with millions in mob cash.

    If you are seeking an exciting, dramatic movie, with everything, including the kitchen sink thrown in, you've found it. This story revolves around a special transit vehicle called the " Money Train. " The armored subway car itself belong to the New York Transit authority and is overseen by Police Chief Donald Paterson (Robert Blake). Although there are many policemen assigned to the Train units, or subway, only two are causing Paterson to become annoyed with their behavior. Officer John and his partner Charlie (Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson) are two disgruntled police officers who have discovered their chief cares more about his train and its on-time schedule, than for the public safety. With their careers all but finished, the two cops plan to rob the train. Both have reasons, but is further complicated when the two half-brothers began squabbling over their beautiful new partner Officer Grace Santiago (Jennifer Lopez). While the two brothers bicker and complain, serious problems like, muggings, pick-pockets and a pyromaniac called 'The Torch" (Chris Cooper) is causing major concerns. The movie is dosed liberally with fists fights, speed chases and explosions of the third kind, enough to called this movie dramatically exciting. Woody Harrelson gives a special tour De force but is equally confronted by Robert Blake's movie presence. This film is guaranteed to produce excitement and an adrenaline rush as audiences are subjected to the glorious trills of a run-away-train. Excellent viewing. ****

    While this film is several years old now, it is still not too bad to watch when it shows up on network TV. At the time it came out, both Woody Harrison and Wesly Snipes were HUGE box office draws..so they put them both together in a film..expecting magic to happen. It wasn't a amazing memorable film though. Fun..yes...parts were kind of laughable. The idea of them being "brothers" of sorts was cool too. They aren't perfect people with perfect lives..the flaws were quite clear..but we like them anyway. Adding Robert Blake was great as well. His tightly wound character looked like he could explode at any moment. It makes us wonder about how warped other parts of his life might be. I did think having Jennifer Lopez on board as a female cop/love interest was a little too much. She was just coming onto the scene as a performer..and it shows here...although not much has improved about her acting skills over the years...she needs to stick with music in my opinion.Did we need to be reminded she was a woman AND of ethnic decent too? The part could have been played by anyone...or simply not been added at all. I guess she was more or less eye candy here. I think my favorite part was the ending...when they had rolled the train..and were confronted by Robert Blakes extremely enraged character in the subway. After all they had been through...they still could stay cool enough to handle in with one swift and direct punch...which he dearly deserved. They end up getting away with the crime..which was wrong..yet..right too. Did they deserve all the money? Maybe. The fact they screwed the system and got away with it? Awesome.

    The film starts out like all those other clich&eacute;d movies and then twenty minutes later it gets worse. The script is poorly written, the music is tedious (this whole film is), and Joseph Ruben is a sh*tty director. The only good film he made is The Forgotten and all those others are good movies to make you sleep if you are insomniac. To waste ten bucks on this film at the cinemas is like insulting your mother then taking it back and slapping yourself for being stupid. And who can forget the horrible acting from nearly everyone, including Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake, and they suck because it seemed like they were auditioning rather than giving a good performance. This film should definitely not be on your list because I can guarantee you that it's a waste of time and money. Jennifer Lopez is the baddest actor to have ever been born because she acts like a rookie who is acting in her first movie and her gross laugh in one of the scenes embarrassed me. The story is weak and clich&eacute;d, no thanks to you Doug Richardson, but most of all it's predictable and you know what the outcome is going to be. I lost respect for Woody Harrelson, who was perfect in Natural Born Killers, because he acts Cr@p and why did he sign up for this movie in the first place? Guess, he must have been poor or something? Robert Blake overreacts lots of times and that is a downside to his acting career. If you have nothing better to do and are counting on watching Money Train then build a sandcastle instead. Two foster brothers, one white and one black, work as transit cops at a local subway station. One has a good life, but the other one has to owe money to some loan shark. He has to pay fifteen grand or his brother is going to die. He has to hijack a money train in order to get the money and secure his brothers life. Working with a hot woman cop, his brother, he has to succeed and nor get caught by a subway owner, Donald Patterson. The action is not all bad but does get boring after a while. To stop yourself from switching off the TV make sure you have some popcorn and friends to share this boring experience with them. I strongly agree with anyone that's is against this film. The film is short, thank God for that, but it seems like it is longer than a millennium. I can go on forever about how bad this film is but I like short and interesting reviews, so I hope this review is both of those. 5/10 - Yuck!

    I don't know what's the film critics' problem with that movie. It is cool job. Film stars Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson which also starred in 1993 hit film "White Men Can't Jump", but that one is not just comedy. It is an action/comedy film which also stars Jennifer Lopez. It is true that plot is non-linear and film have not a point but it's cool Christmas movie. Wesley Snipes has some well done fight scenes, Woody Harrelson is the main reason of the film's humor. I guess one critic said right about that movie, it has everything we asked from an action movie, not a great plot or great dialogs but it has some great action/martial arts scenes and some hilarious moment, it's not kind of a Jackie Chan movie but it's still good. If we return to Jennifer Lopez, her acting was awful but she was just hot and let us forget her awful acting job in a scene where Wesley Snipes banged her, but the boxing scene between them was also good. I loved their chemistry. So, watch these movie! It is a typical action film with some funny moments, great actors (Wesley and Woody), cool action scenes and hot Jennifer Lopez but don't wait any point or even a plot.

    I recall a review about this movie where the critic was so furious saying things like "Where is the train ?", "This is one of the worst train movies!" while he was somehow missing the point, I think he wasn't completely wrong. Actually this climactic sequence looks confused move since the train's heist is nothing but sudden third act's plot not the whole movie and not related to what seemed the basic duel (the subway's burner) which ends strangely earlier. So, with the misleading title you've got to feel disappointed or at least muddled, repining "this is not a train movie" and it is, but you're the last to know ! And yes, some of the bosses are megalomaniac asses, or psychos anyway, but still making the money train's manager as the story's villain wasn't that right or believable especially with his behaviors near the end. Plus that end which wasn't as simple as what this kind of straight action used to present, being for many people as unethical. Yet I have to defend this as originally it's a story about the love between 2, totally different, brothers where one eventually wins love and the other wins well.. money.. dirty money, just to assure the difference between them both as one good cop and one forever hustler whom their argument has no end. (Joseph Ruben) is the man who can make attractive visual work yet nearly always with not attractive scripts ! He's a very good director but surely not the best when it comes to feeling anything wrong with the writing he deals with. So not many times he got scripts as smart as his direction.. and that's the tragedy ! Though, it's a fair action with great cast. Definitely this is better than (Wesley Snipes & Woody Harrelson)'s last movie (White Men Can't Jump) which's not up to this one's lovely time, let alone being one of the silliest movies ever. (Harrelson) did it so well as a childish loser. (Snipes) was charismatic and performed some of the most memorable fights. And it's enough enjoyment to watch a young brunet (Jennifer Lopez). All the elements (the cinematography, editing, and of course the music) was solid maybe more than the main story. Another side of the movie's misfortune is that it came in the year of 1995 where movies by the names of (Die Hard with a Vengeance), (Bad Boys), (Assassins), (Heat), (Se7en), (Braveheart) were produced. Tough I know. Especially with the more successful results from the box office, the critics, or both. But whatever.. I like (Money Train). I think if you forgot about it as a train movie or heist one you'd discover that it's a fun ride with some well-made action, J-lo too and happy end a la' Hollywood where everybody wins and the evil guy goes to hell. Simply wouldn't you like to destroy your pity work, hit your lunatic boss on the jaw, get free money AND get away with it ? Don't answer this.. Just re-watch the movie !

    Money Train is set in New York where Christmas is fast approaching, subway decoy squad cop Charlie (Woody Harrelson) owes $15,000 of gambling debts to Mr. Brown (Scott Sowers) a very unpleasant mobster. Brown wants his money or he'll hurt him, Carlie's foster brother & fellow New York subway decoy squad cop John (Wesley Snipes) gives him the $15,000 but Charlie loses it. If that wasn't bad enough after a cock-up at work both Charlie & John are sacked by their heartless boss Chief Donald Patterson (Robert Blake), out of options Charlie decides to rob the money train that travels from station to station collecting the revenue... Directed by Joseph Ruben this big budget comedy thriller has a pretty bad reputation but I have to say I quite liked it for what it was. The script by Doug Richardson & David Loughery initially sounds like a straight heist film in the vein of The Italian Job (1969) or The First Great Train Robbery (1979) but the majority of the film feels much more like a buddy buddy mismatched partner thriller, the signs are there for all to see. The mismatched partners with one black & one white which leads to all sorts of amusing racial gags, the fact they are both on the edge & have personal issues but are basically good guy's, there's a pointless romantic subplot & there's several bad guy's that they bring down. There are lots of dialogue scenes all of which seem to cram as many 'F' swear words in as possible, the subplots with Jennifer Lopez & the Torch villain are not needed, Charlie's gambling debts are all but forgotten about by the end & there are scene that are very hard to believe. A cop turning up drunk for work for instance is instant dismissal, starting a fight with your fellow police officers would also get you the sack & there's just not much factual accuracy here. Having said that I quite liked it, I did think certain parts of it were amusing, some of the one-liners & dialogue worked, there's are some impressive fights & a cool train crash at the end although the actually robbery isn't that clever or well thought out. The character's are a mixed bag, Charlie & John are likable but it's them who decided to rob the train in the first place, it's them who initially put other passengers lives at risk not Patterson, then when they get away with it we are supposed to happy for them because even though what happened was their doing, they have stolen money & caused a huge crash & immense damage. Director Ruben does alright, I must admit I think the opening titles are very nice to look at as there are alternating aerial shots of a neon lit New York & some moody scenes of a festive New York going about it's business. There's not much action until the end, a few motorbike stunts & a few fights is about it but they are good nicely violent fights though. The out of control train scenes at the end look good although the final crash is obviously a model. The pace is uneven, until the last forty odd minutes it's a fairly slow film but it did keep my interest with some funny dialogue & a fairly engaging story. With a supposed budget of about $68,000,000 Money Train was an absolute disaster at the box-office for Columbia Pictures, the film opened at number 4 at the end of 1995 to a first weekend gross of just over $10 million as it went up against Toy Story (1995), Goldeneye (1995) & Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) all of which opened at or around the same time as Money Train which tanked & ended it's theatrical run with a paltry $35 million. Ouch. The acting is alright with Snipes & Harrelson putting in likable performances while Jennifer Lopez is as awful as ever & luckily she has no more than a cameo role & as such doesn't ruin things that much. Money Train was a disaster at the box-office, it's generally disliked by both critics & the public but I have to say I quite liked it, it isn't any sort of masterpiece but it just about kept my interest & came away from it feeling entertained & feeling I had fun. Worth a watch if you can watch it on telly for free.

    woody harrelson character was so stupid in this movie he was a white brother of a black guy played by Wesley snipes.all he ever did was wasting life living on brothers money & creates trouble for himself & others. the time Jennifer Lopez made and entrance in the film i was relaxed because the stupid comedy of snipes & woody was pissing me off. the money train is about 2 cops friends/bros they work on a N.Y subway station.Charlie plans to rob the money train which collects millions of revenue from the station. despite the action scenes in train & stunts the film fails to deliver . but this film is a timpass movie & will rob you of your money & times if you by it on DVD.that just happened to me.ill avoid Wesley snipes movie from now on the guy has lost it my rating is 3/10.worth looking for J.LO

    One neat way to find out about a certain movie is to go on Youtube and watch a movie review show. This movie, it just so happens, I found out about thanks to the show "Movie Night", a show on the said website from the same user who made the popular show "Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?", and both I find to be very good shows that I recommend you watch. Anyway, let's not waste any more time over Movie Night and get on with the review. This movie, to say the very least, is convoluted. I say convoluted because the relationship between John and Charlie is never stable considering how much time they spend together on the screen. I also say convoluted because the plot of the movie is all over the place. Sure, I get the Money Train idea and that all the revenue from the metro system of New York is transported by train to a company of greedy psycho cops. I get that this lady named Grace Santiago, played by none other than Jennifer Lopez, comes into the movie and plays into the plights of both John and Charlie, not to mention that she apparently is supposed to show her full skin on New Year's Eve in the movie. I even get that the Money Train would affect everybody who plays a part in the film. However, the way the movie presents itself does not make the movie fit very well, even though I couldn't help but smile at some tidbits here and there. Therefore, everything about the movie left me rather mixed as to what the hell was going on. The character development was nothing new here, and the characters were very hard to respect because all they ever do is do the same thing over and over again in different ways. Charlie is a screw-up, John is a conservative trying to get his life straight, Grace is trying to be the aggressive cop, and the boss is trying to threaten everybody while trying to remind everybody that he is the God of all police officers. None of this really worked well for me because that means everybody was too static for any major changes, even though some, and ONLY some, of the dialogue can actually be considered realistic enough to be repeated. Lastly, I want to talk about the premise. Train robberies have been executed better in both stuff before and after the movie came out. However, it doesn't mean that it was the absolute worst either. It did do enough to keep me in my seat even though it was 1-3 hours after midnight, and it didn't have the stupidity that was unfortunately copied by the 2010 movie "The Other Guys", so I actually watched the whole thing. However, serious work needed to be done with the script that was never accomplished. (November 19th, 2011) Grade: E (4.4/10 Rating)

    This movie is mediocre at best.. My biggest point here is that it seems like they were trying to "cash in" on the Lethal Weapon format, buddy cop, white guy / black guy, straight shooter, crazy guy.. Plot is paper thin and seems like a total rip off of the success of this format that worked almost 10 years prior. Just a thought.. They also seem to have tried to opt for the same soundtrack feel. It actually took me a minute to realize that it really is Jennifer Lopez in the movie. I recognized her voice immediately but she looks so much different than she does now or in movies that followed this one. AMC has it as part of "the new classics" but I have to disagree. Think there are plenty of other films that would be much better suited for this category. Overall its not unwatchable but, not really sold on watching it again..

    In this widely anticipated sequel to the original, our favorite multicolored crime fighting duo returns, in "White Men Can't Jump Two: The Great Train Robbery". In this adventure, our heroes must use their basketball and police skills to defeat an evil New York City train conductor with mob ties. Billy decides to dump Gloria for a chance with her much more attractive cousin, Jennifer Lopez, but Sidney is after her too. The two end up settling the dispute with a game of one on one, and Sidney wins (surprise!). As the winner, Sidney gets to have sex with Jennifer Lopez, while Billy is beaten senseless by mobsters. Billy feels betrayed by his brother from another mother, leading him on a drinking binge that leaves him incapable of performing his police duties during a subway arsonist attack. Unfortunately, Jennifer Lopez is consumed in the fiery blaze. Sidney blames Billy for the tragedy, and fisticuffs ensue. Sidney's legs are badly injured in the brawl, rendering him incapable of dunking. Our heroes forgive each other and reunite to play an epic game of two on two (NBA JAM style) against the arsonist and the train conductor. The contest is intense and physical. The arsonist catches fire from the perimeter, raining down fiery threes. With Sidney's weakened legs and Billy's whiteness, our heroes must rely on their shooting skills to stay competitive. The bad guys are ruthless with their dirty play, and Sidney and the arsonist end up fighting to the death. The arsonist soaks Sidney with gasoline and is about to throw his lighter at him, but Sidney lights him on fire with a magic fire stick then hits him with a train. Sidney then roundhouse kicks him through a plate glass window for good measure. The arsonist dies, but Sidney is issued a flagrant II for excessive contact to the head/neck with a train, and ejected from the game. In the end, its Billy vs the mob conductor, one on one. Billy dunks over the conductor to seal the victory, proving once and for all again, that white men really can jump. Then the mob conductor is brought to justice, and our heroes make away with millions in mob cash.

So, with the misleading title you've got to feel disappointed or at least muddled, repining "this is not a train movie" and it is, but you're the last to know ! And yes, some of the bosses are megalomaniac asses, or psychos anyway, but still making the money train's manager as the story's villain wasn't that right or believable especially with his behaviors near the end. Plus that end which wasn't as simple as what this kind of straight action used to present, being for many people as unethical. Yet I have to defend this as originally it's a story about the love between 2, totally different, brothers where one eventually wins love and the other wins well.. money.. dirty money, just to assure the difference between them both as one good cop and one forever hustler whom their argument has no end. (Joseph Ruben) is the man who can make attractive visual work yet nearly always with not attractive scripts ! He's a very good director but surely not the best when it comes to feeling anything wrong with the writing he deals with. So not many times he got scripts as smart as his direction.. and that's the tragedy ! Though, it's a fair action with great cast. Definitely this is better than (Wesley Snipes & Woody Harrelson)'s last movie (White Men Can't Jump) which's not up to this one's lovely time, let alone being one of the silliest movies ever. (Harrelson) did it so well as a childish loser. (Snipes) was charismatic and performed some of the most memorable fights. And it's enough enjoyment to watch a young brunet (Jennifer Lopez). All the elements (the cinematography, editing, and of course the music) was solid maybe more than the main story. Another side of the movie's misfortune is that it came in the year of 1995 where movies by the names of (Die Hard with a Vengeance), (Bad Boys), (Assassins), (Heat), (Se7en), (Braveheart) were produced. Tough I know. Especially with the more successful results from the box office, the critics, or both. But whatever.. I like (Money Train). I think if you forgot about it as a train movie or heist one you'd discover that it's a fun ride with some well-made action, J-lo too and happy end a la' Hollywood where everybody wins and the evil guy goes to hell. Simply wouldn't you like to destroy your pity work, hit your lunatic boss on the jaw, get free money AND get away with it ? Don't answer this.. Just re-watch the movie !

    Money Train is set in New York where Christmas is fast approaching, subway decoy squad cop Charlie (Woody Harrelson) owes $15,000 of gambling debts to Mr. Brown (Scott Sowers) a very unpleasant mobster. Brown wants his money or he'll hurt him, Carlie's foster brother & fellow New York subway decoy squad cop John (Wesley Snipes) gives him the $15,000 but Charlie loses it. If that wasn't bad enough after a cock-up at work both Charlie & John are sacked by their heartless boss Chief Donald Patterson (Robert Blake), out of options Charlie decides to rob the money train that travels from station to station collecting the revenue... Directed by Joseph Ruben this big budget comedy thriller has a pretty bad reputation but I have to say I quite liked it for what it was. The script by Doug Richardson & David Loughery initially sounds like a straight heist film in the vein of The Italian Job (1969) or The First Great Train Robbery (1979) but the majority of the film feels much more like a buddy buddy mismatched partner thriller, the signs are there for all to see. The mismatched partners with one black & one white which leads to all sorts of amusing racial gags, the fact they are both on the edge & have personal issues but are basically good guy's, there's a pointless romantic subplot & there's several bad guy's that they bring down. There are lots of dialogue scenes all of which seem to cram as many 'F' swear words in as possible, the subplots with Jennifer Lopez & the Torch villain are not needed, Charlie's gambling debts are all but forgotten about by the end & there are scene that are very hard to believe. A cop turning up drunk for work for instance is instant dismissal, starting a fight with your fellow police officers would also get you the sack & there's just not much factual accuracy here. Having said that I quite liked it, I did think certain parts of it were amusing, some of the one-liners & dialogue worked, there's are some impressive fights & a cool train crash at the end although the actually robbery isn't that clever or well thought out. The character's are a mixed bag, Charlie & John are likable but it's them who decided to rob the train in the first place, it's them who initially put other passengers lives at risk not Patterson, then when they get away with it we are supposed to happy for them because even though what happened was their doing, they have stolen money & caused a huge crash & immense damage. Director Ruben does alright, I must admit I think the opening titles are very nice to look at as there are alternating aerial shots of a neon lit New York & some moody scenes of a festive New York going about it's business. There's not much action until the end, a few motorbike stunts & a few fights is about it but they are good nicely violent fights though. The out of control train scenes at the end look good although the final crash is obviously a model. The pace is uneven, until the last forty odd minutes it's a fairly slow film but it did keep my interest with some funny dialogue & a fairly engaging story. With a supposed budget of about $68,000,000 Money Train was an absolute disaster at the box-office for Columbia Pictures, the film opened at number 4 at the end of 1995 to a first weekend gross of just over $10 million as it went up against Toy Story (1995), Goldeneye (1995) & Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) all of which opened at or around the same time as Money Train which tanked & ended it's theatrical run with a paltry $35 million. Ouch. The acting is alright with Snipes & Harrelson putting in likable performances while Jennifer Lopez is as awful as ever & luckily she has no more than a cameo role & as such doesn't ruin things that much. Money Train was a disaster at the box-office, it's generally disliked by both critics & the public but I have to say I quite liked it, it isn't any sort of masterpiece but it just about kept my interest & came away from it feeling entertained & feeling I had fun. Worth a watch if you can watch it on telly for free.

    One neat way to find out about a certain movie is to go on Youtube and watch a movie review show. This movie, it just so happens, I found out about thanks to the show "Movie Night", a show on the said website from the same user who made the popular show "Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?", and both I find to be very good shows that I recommend you watch. Anyway, let's not waste any more time over Movie Night and get on with the review. This movie, to say the very least, is convoluted. I say convoluted because the relationship between John and Charlie is never stable considering how much time they spend together on the screen. I also say convoluted because the plot of the movie is all over the place. Sure, I get the Money Train idea and that all the revenue from the metro system of New York is transported by train to a company of greedy psycho cops. I get that this lady named Grace Santiago, played by none other than Jennifer Lopez, comes into the movie and plays into the plights of both John and Charlie, not to mention that she apparently is supposed to show her full skin on New Year's Eve in the movie. I even get that the Money Train would affect everybody who plays a part in the film. However, the way the movie presents itself does not make the movie fit very well, even though I couldn't help but smile at some tidbits here and there. Therefore, everything about the movie left me rather mixed as to what the hell was going on. The character development was nothing new here, and the characters were very hard to respect because all they ever do is do the same thing over and over again in different ways. Charlie is a screw-up, John is a conservative trying to get his life straight, Grace is trying to be the aggressive cop, and the boss is trying to threaten everybody while trying to remind everybody that he is the God of all police officers. None of this really worked well for me because that means everybody was too static for any major changes, even though some, and ONLY some, of the dialogue can actually be considered realistic enough to be repeated. Lastly, I want to talk about the premise. Train robberies have been executed better in both stuff before and after the movie came out. However, it doesn't mean that it was the absolute worst either. It did do enough to keep me in my seat even though it was 1-3 hours after midnight, and it didn't have the stupidity that was unfortunately copied by the 2010 movie "The Other Guys", so I actually watched the whole thing. However, serious work needed to be done with the script that was never accomplished. (November 19th, 2011) Grade: E (4.4/10 Rating)

    This movie is mediocre at best.. My biggest point here is that it seems like they were trying to "cash in" on the Lethal Weapon format, buddy cop, white guy / black guy, straight shooter, crazy guy.. Plot is paper thin and seems like a total rip off of the success of this format that worked almost 10 years prior. Just a thought.. They also seem to have tried to opt for the same soundtrack feel. It actually took me a minute to realize that it really is Jennifer Lopez in the movie. I recognized her voice immediately but she looks so much different than she does now or in movies that followed this one. AMC has it as part of "the new classics" but I have to disagree. Think there are plenty of other films that would be much better suited for this category. Overall its not unwatchable but, not really sold on watching it again..

    In this widely anticipated sequel to the original, our favorite multicolored crime fighting duo returns, in "White Men Can't Jump Two: The Great Train Robbery". In this adventure, our heroes must use their basketball and police skills to defeat an evil New York City train conductor with mob ties. Billy decides to dump Gloria for a chance with her much more attractive cousin, Jennifer Lopez, but Sidney is after her too. The two end up settling the dispute with a game of one on one, and Sidney wins (surprise!). As the winner, Sidney gets to have sex with Jennifer Lopez, while Billy is beaten senseless by mobsters. Billy feels betrayed by his brother from another mother, leading him on a drinking binge that leaves him incapable of performing his police duties during a subway arsonist attack. Unfortunately, Jennifer Lopez is consumed in the fiery blaze. Sidney blames Billy for the tragedy, and fisticuffs ensue. Sidney's legs are badly injured in the brawl, rendering him incapable of dunking. Our heroes forgive each other and reunite to play an epic game of two on two (NBA JAM style) against the arsonist and the train conductor. The contest is intense and physical. The arsonist catches fire from the perimeter, raining down fiery threes. With Sidney's weakened legs and Billy's whiteness, our heroes must rely on their shooting skills to stay competitive. The bad guys are ruthless with their dirty play, and Sidney and the arsonist end up fighting to the death. The arsonist soaks Sidney with gasoline and is about to throw his lighter at him, but Sidney lights him on fire with a magic fire stick then hits him with a train. Sidney then roundhouse kicks him through a plate glass window for good measure. The arsonist dies, but Sidney is issued a flagrant II for excessive contact to the head/neck with a train, and ejected from the game. In the end, its Billy vs the mob conductor, one on one. Billy dunks over the conductor to seal the victory, proving once and for all again, that white men really can jump. Then the mob conductor is brought to justice, and our heroes make away with millions in mob cash.

    If you are seeking an exciting, dramatic movie, with everything, including the kitchen sink thrown in, you've found it. This story revolves around a special transit vehicle called the " Money Train. " The armored subway car itself belong to the New York Transit authority and is overseen by Police Chief Donald Paterson (Robert Blake). Although there are many policemen assigned to the Train units, or subway, only two are causing Paterson to become annoyed with their behavior. Officer John and his partner Charlie (Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson) are two disgruntled police officers who have discovered their chief cares more about his train and its on-time schedule, than for the public safety. With their careers all but finished, the two cops plan to rob the train. Both have reasons, but is further complicated when the two half-brothers began squabbling over their beautiful new partner Officer Grace Santiago (Jennifer Lopez). While the two brothers bicker and complain, serious problems like, muggings, pick-pockets and a pyromaniac called 'The Torch" (Chris Cooper) is causing major concerns. The movie is dosed liberally with fists fights, speed chases and explosions of the third kind, enough to called this movie dramatically exciting. Woody Harrelson gives a special tour De force but is equally confronted by Robert Blake's movie presence. This film is guaranteed to produce excitement and an adrenaline rush as audiences are subjected to the glorious trills of a run-away-train. Excellent viewing. ****

    While this film is several years old now, it is still not too bad to watch when it shows up on network TV. At the time it came out, both Woody Harrison and Wesly Snipes were HUGE box office draws..so they put them both together in a film..expecting magic to happen. It wasn't a amazing memorable film though. Fun..yes...parts were kind of laughable. The idea of them being "brothers" of sorts was cool too. They aren't perfect people with perfect lives..the flaws were quite clear..but we like them anyway. Adding Robert Blake was great as well. His tightly wound character looked like he could explode at any moment. It makes us wonder about how warped other parts of his life might be. I did think having Jennifer Lopez on board as a female cop/love interest was a little too much. She was just coming onto the scene as a performer..and it shows here...although not much has improved about her acting skills over the years...she needs to stick with music in my opinion.Did we need to be reminded she was a woman AND of ethnic decent too? The part could have been played by anyone...or simply not been added at all. I guess she was more or less eye candy here. I think my favorite part was the ending...when they had rolled the train..and were confronted by Robert Blakes extremely enraged character in the subway. After all they had been through...they still could stay cool enough to handle in with one swift and direct punch...which he dearly deserved. They end up getting away with the crime..which was wrong..yet..right too. Did they deserve all the money? Maybe. The fact they screwed the system and got away with it? Awesome.

    The film starts out like all those other clich&eacute;d movies and then twenty minutes later it gets worse. The script is poorly written, the music is tedious (this whole film is), and Joseph Ruben is a sh*tty director. The only good film he made is The Forgotten and all those others are good movies to make you sleep if you are insomniac. To waste ten bucks on this film at the cinemas is like insulting your mother then taking it back and slapping yourself for being stupid. And who can forget the horrible acting from nearly everyone, including Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake, and they suck because it seemed like they were auditioning rather than giving a good performance. This film should definitely not be on your list because I can guarantee you that it's a waste of time and money. Jennifer Lopez is the baddest actor to have ever been born because she acts like a rookie who is acting in her first movie and her gross laugh in one of the scenes embarrassed me. The story is weak and clich&eacute;d, no thanks to you Doug Richardson, but most of all it's predictable and you know what the outcome is going to be. I lost respect for Woody Harrelson, who was perfect in Natural Born Killers, because he acts Cr@p and why did he sign up for this movie in the first place? Guess, he must have been poor or something? Robert Blake overreacts lots of times and that is a downside to his acting career. If you have nothing better to do and are counting on watching Money Train then build a sandcastle instead. Two foster brothers, one white and one black, work as transit cops at a local subway station. One has a good life, but the other one has to owe money to some loan shark. He has to pay fifteen grand or his brother is going to die. He has to hijack a money train in order to get the money and secure his brothers life. Working with a hot woman cop, his brother, he has to succeed and nor get caught by a subway owner, Donald Patterson. The action is not all bad but does get boring after a while. To stop yourself from switching off the TV make sure you have some popcorn and friends to share this boring experience with them. I strongly agree with anyone that's is against this film. The film is short, thank God for that, but it seems like it is longer than a millennium. I can go on forever about how bad this film is but I like short and interesting reviews, so I hope this review is both of those. 5/10 - Yuck!

    I don't know what's the film critics' problem with that movie. It is cool job. Film stars Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson which also starred in 1993 hit film "White Men Can't Jump", but that one is not just comedy. It is an action/comedy film which also stars Jennifer Lopez. It is true that plot is non-linear and film have not a point but it's cool Christmas movie. Wesley Snipes has some well done fight scenes, Woody Harrelson is the main reason of the film's humor. I guess one critic said right about that movie, it has everything we asked from an action movie, not a great plot or great dialogs but it has some great action/martial arts scenes and some hilarious moment, it's not kind of a Jackie Chan movie but it's still good. If we return to Jennifer Lopez, her acting was awful but she was just hot and let us forget her awful acting job in a scene where Wesley Snipes banged her, but the boxing scene between them was also good. I loved their chemistry. So, watch these movie! It is a typical action film with some funny moments, great actors (Wesley and Woody), cool action scenes and hot Jennifer Lopez but don't wait any point or even a plot.

    Money Train is set in New York where Christmas is fast approaching, subway decoy squad cop Charlie (Woody Harrelson) owes $15,000 of gambling debts to Mr. Brown (Scott Sowers) a very unpleasant mobster. Brown wants his money or he'll hurt him, Carlie's foster brother & fellow New York subway decoy squad cop John (Wesley Snipes) gives him the $15,000 but Charlie loses it. If that wasn't bad enough after a cock-up at work both Charlie & John are sacked by their heartless boss Chief Donald Patterson (Robert Blake), out of options Charlie decides to rob the money train that travels from station to station collecting the revenue...

I get that this lady named Grace Santiago, played by none other than Jennifer Lopez, comes into the movie and plays into the plights of both John and Charlie, not to mention that she apparently is supposed to show her full skin on New Year's Eve in the movie. I even get that the Money Train would affect everybody who plays a part in the film. However, the way the movie presents itself does not make the movie fit very well, even though I couldn't help but smile at some tidbits here and there. Therefore, everything about the movie left me rather mixed as to what the hell was going on. The character development was nothing new here, and the characters were very hard to respect because all they ever do is do the same thing over and over again in different ways. Charlie is a screw-up, John is a conservative trying to get his life straight, Grace is trying to be the aggressive cop, and the boss is trying to threaten everybody while trying to remind everybody that he is the God of all police officers. None of this really worked well for me because that means everybody was too static for any major changes, even though some, and ONLY some, of the dialogue can actually be considered realistic enough to be repeated. Lastly, I want to talk about the premise. Train robberies have been executed better in both stuff before and after the movie came out. However, it doesn't mean that it was the absolute worst either. It did do enough to keep me in my seat even though it was 1-3 hours after midnight, and it didn't have the stupidity that was unfortunately copied by the 2010 movie "The Other Guys", so I actually watched the whole thing. However, serious work needed to be done with the script that was never accomplished. (November 19th, 2011) Grade: E (4.4/10 Rating)

    This movie is mediocre at best.. My biggest point here is that it seems like they were trying to "cash in" on the Lethal Weapon format, buddy cop, white guy / black guy, straight shooter, crazy guy.. Plot is paper thin and seems like a total rip off of the success of this format that worked almost 10 years prior. Just a thought.. They also seem to have tried to opt for the same soundtrack feel. It actually took me a minute to realize that it really is Jennifer Lopez in the movie. I recognized her voice immediately but she looks so much different than she does now or in movies that followed this one. AMC has it as part of "the new classics" but I have to disagree. Think there are plenty of other films that would be much better suited for this category. Overall its not unwatchable but, not really sold on watching it again..

    In this widely anticipated sequel to the original, our favorite multicolored crime fighting duo returns, in "White Men Can't Jump Two: The Great Train Robbery". In this adventure, our heroes must use their basketball and police skills to defeat an evil New York City train conductor with mob ties. Billy decides to dump Gloria for a chance with her much more attractive cousin, Jennifer Lopez, but Sidney is after her too. The two end up settling the dispute with a game of one on one, and Sidney wins (surprise!). As the winner, Sidney gets to have sex with Jennifer Lopez, while Billy is beaten senseless by mobsters. Billy feels betrayed by his brother from another mother, leading him on a drinking binge that leaves him incapable of performing his police duties during a subway arsonist attack. Unfortunately, Jennifer Lopez is consumed in the fiery blaze. Sidney blames Billy for the tragedy, and fisticuffs ensue. Sidney's legs are badly injured in the brawl, rendering him incapable of dunking. Our heroes forgive each other and reunite to play an epic game of two on two (NBA JAM style) against the arsonist and the train conductor. The contest is intense and physical. The arsonist catches fire from the perimeter, raining down fiery threes. With Sidney's weakened legs and Billy's whiteness, our heroes must rely on their shooting skills to stay competitive. The bad guys are ruthless with their dirty play, and Sidney and the arsonist end up fighting to the death. The arsonist soaks Sidney with gasoline and is about to throw his lighter at him, but Sidney lights him on fire with a magic fire stick then hits him with a train. Sidney then roundhouse kicks him through a plate glass window for good measure. The arsonist dies, but Sidney is issued a flagrant II for excessive contact to the head/neck with a train, and ejected from the game. In the end, its Billy vs the mob conductor, one on one. Billy dunks over the conductor to seal the victory, proving once and for all again, that white men really can jump. Then the mob conductor is brought to justice, and our heroes make away with millions in mob cash.

    If you are seeking an exciting, dramatic movie, with everything, including the kitchen sink thrown in, you've found it. This story revolves around a special transit vehicle called the " Money Train. " The armored subway car itself belong to the New York Transit authority and is overseen by Police Chief Donald Paterson (Robert Blake). Although there are many policemen assigned to the Train units, or subway, only two are causing Paterson to become annoyed with their behavior. Officer John and his partner Charlie (Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson) are two disgruntled police officers who have discovered their chief cares more about his train and its on-time schedule, than for the public safety. With their careers all but finished, the two cops plan to rob the train. Both have reasons, but is further complicated when the two half-brothers began squabbling over their beautiful new partner Officer Grace Santiago (Jennifer Lopez). While the two brothers bicker and complain, serious problems like, muggings, pick-pockets and a pyromaniac called 'The Torch" (Chris Cooper) is causing major concerns. The movie is dosed liberally with fists fights, speed chases and explosions of the third kind, enough to called this movie dramatically exciting. Woody Harrelson gives a special tour De force but is equally confronted by Robert Blake's movie presence. This film is guaranteed to produce excitement and an adrenaline rush as audiences are subjected to the glorious trills of a run-away-train. Excellent viewing. ****

    While this film is several years old now, it is still not too bad to watch when it shows up on network TV. At the time it came out, both Woody Harrison and Wesly Snipes were HUGE box office draws..so they put them both together in a film..expecting magic to happen. It wasn't a amazing memorable film though. Fun..yes...parts were kind of laughable. The idea of them being "brothers" of sorts was cool too. They aren't perfect people with perfect lives..the flaws were quite clear..but we like them anyway. Adding Robert Blake was great as well. His tightly wound character looked like he could explode at any moment. It makes us wonder about how warped other parts of his life might be. I did think having Jennifer Lopez on board as a female cop/love interest was a little too much. She was just coming onto the scene as a performer..and it shows here...although not much has improved about her acting skills over the years...she needs to stick with music in my opinion.Did we need to be reminded she was a woman AND of ethnic decent too? The part could have been played by anyone...or simply not been added at all. I guess she was more or less eye candy here. I think my favorite part was the ending...when they had rolled the train..and were confronted by Robert Blakes extremely enraged character in the subway. After all they had been through...they still could stay cool enough to handle in with one swift and direct punch...which he dearly deserved. They end up getting away with the crime..which was wrong..yet..right too. Did they deserve all the money? Maybe. The fact they screwed the system and got away with it? Awesome.

    The film starts out like all those other clich&eacute;d movies and then twenty minutes later it gets worse. The script is poorly written, the music is tedious (this whole film is), and Joseph Ruben is a sh*tty director. The only good film he made is The Forgotten and all those others are good movies to make you sleep if you are insomniac. To waste ten bucks on this film at the cinemas is like insulting your mother then taking it back and slapping yourself for being stupid. And who can forget the horrible acting from nearly everyone, including Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake, and they suck because it seemed like they were auditioning rather than giving a good performance. This film should definitely not be on your list because I can guarantee you that it's a waste of time and money. Jennifer Lopez is the baddest actor to have ever been born because she acts like a rookie who is acting in her first movie and her gross laugh in one of the scenes embarrassed me. The story is weak and clich&eacute;d, no thanks to you Doug Richardson, but most of all it's predictable and you know what the outcome is going to be. I lost respect for Woody Harrelson, who was perfect in Natural Born Killers, because he acts Cr@p and why did he sign up for this movie in the first place? Guess, he must have been poor or something? Robert Blake overreacts lots of times and that is a downside to his acting career. If you have nothing better to do and are counting on watching Money Train then build a sandcastle instead. Two foster brothers, one white and one black, work as transit cops at a local subway station. One has a good life, but the other one has to owe money to some loan shark. He has to pay fifteen grand or his brother is going to die. He has to hijack a money train in order to get the money and secure his brothers life. Working with a hot woman cop, his brother, he has to succeed and nor get caught by a subway owner, Donald Patterson. The action is not all bad but does get boring after a while. To stop yourself from switching off the TV make sure you have some popcorn and friends to share this boring experience with them. I strongly agree with anyone that's is against this film. The film is short, thank God for that, but it seems like it is longer than a millennium. I can go on forever about how bad this film is but I like short and interesting reviews, so I hope this review is both of those. 5/10 - Yuck!

    I don't know what's the film critics' problem with that movie. It is cool job. Film stars Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson which also starred in 1993 hit film "White Men Can't Jump", but that one is not just comedy. It is an action/comedy film which also stars Jennifer Lopez. It is true that plot is non-linear and film have not a point but it's cool Christmas movie. Wesley Snipes has some well done fight scenes, Woody Harrelson is the main reason of the film's humor. I guess one critic said right about that movie, it has everything we asked from an action movie, not a great plot or great dialogs but it has some great action/martial arts scenes and some hilarious moment, it's not kind of a Jackie Chan movie but it's still good. If we return to Jennifer Lopez, her acting was awful but she was just hot and let us forget her awful acting job in a scene where Wesley Snipes banged her, but the boxing scene between them was also good. I loved their chemistry. So, watch these movie! It is a typical action film with some funny moments, great actors (Wesley and Woody), cool action scenes and hot Jennifer Lopez but don't wait any point or even a plot.

    I recall a review about this movie where the critic was so furious saying things like "Where is the train ?", "This is one of the worst train movies!" while he was somehow missing the point, I think he wasn't completely wrong. Actually this climactic sequence looks confused move since the train's heist is nothing but sudden third act's plot not the whole movie and not related to what seemed the basic duel (the subway's burner) which ends strangely earlier. So, with the misleading title you've got to feel disappointed or at least muddled, repining "this is not a train movie" and it is, but you're the last to know ! And yes, some of the bosses are megalomaniac asses, or psychos anyway, but still making the money train's manager as the story's villain wasn't that right or believable especially with his behaviors near the end. Plus that end which wasn't as simple as what this kind of straight action used to present, being for many people as unethical. Yet I have to defend this as originally it's a story about the love between 2, totally different, brothers where one eventually wins love and the other wins well.. money.. dirty money, just to assure the difference between them both as one good cop and one forever hustler whom their argument has no end. (Joseph Ruben) is the man who can make attractive visual work yet nearly always with not attractive scripts ! He's a very good director but surely not the best when it comes to feeling anything wrong with the writing he deals with. So not many times he got scripts as smart as his direction.. and that's the tragedy ! Though, it's a fair action with great cast. Definitely this is better than (Wesley Snipes & Woody Harrelson)'s last movie (White Men Can't Jump) which's not up to this one's lovely time, let alone being one of the silliest movies ever. (Harrelson) did it so well as a childish loser. (Snipes) was charismatic and performed some of the most memorable fights. And it's enough enjoyment to watch a young brunet (Jennifer Lopez). All the elements (the cinematography, editing, and of course the music) was solid maybe more than the main story. Another side of the movie's misfortune is that it came in the year of 1995 where movies by the names of (Die Hard with a Vengeance), (Bad Boys), (Assassins), (Heat), (Se7en), (Braveheart) were produced. Tough I know. Especially with the more successful results from the box office, the critics, or both. But whatever.. I like (Money Train). I think if you forgot about it as a train movie or heist one you'd discover that it's a fun ride with some well-made action, J-lo too and happy end a la' Hollywood where everybody wins and the evil guy goes to hell. Simply wouldn't you like to destroy your pity work, hit your lunatic boss on the jaw, get free money AND get away with it ? Don't answer this.. Just re-watch the movie !

    Money Train is set in New York where Christmas is fast approaching, subway decoy squad cop Charlie (Woody Harrelson) owes $15,000 of gambling debts to Mr. Brown (Scott Sowers) a very unpleasant mobster. Brown wants his money or he'll hurt him, Carlie's foster brother & fellow New York subway decoy squad cop John (Wesley Snipes) gives him the $15,000 but Charlie loses it. If that wasn't bad enough after a cock-up at work both Charlie & John are sacked by their heartless boss Chief Donald Patterson (Robert Blake), out of options Charlie decides to rob the money train that travels from station to station collecting the revenue... Directed by Joseph Ruben this big budget comedy thriller has a pretty bad reputation but I have to say I quite liked it for what it was. The script by Doug Richardson & David Loughery initially sounds like a straight heist film in the vein of The Italian Job (1969) or The First Great Train Robbery (1979) but the majority of the film feels much more like a buddy buddy mismatched partner thriller, the signs are there for all to see. The mismatched partners with one black & one white which leads to all sorts of amusing racial gags, the fact they are both on the edge & have personal issues but are basically good guy's, there's a pointless romantic subplot & there's several bad guy's that they bring down. There are lots of dialogue scenes all of which seem to cram as many 'F' swear words in as possible, the subplots with Jennifer Lopez & the Torch villain are not needed, Charlie's gambling debts are all but forgotten about by the end & there are scene that are very hard to believe. A cop turning up drunk for work for instance is instant dismissal, starting a fight with your fellow police officers would also get you the sack & there's just not much factual accuracy here. Having said that I quite liked it, I did think certain parts of it were amusing, some of the one-liners & dialogue worked, there's are some impressive fights & a cool train crash at the end although the actually robbery isn't that clever or well thought out. The character's are a mixed bag, Charlie & John are likable but it's them who decided to rob the train in the first place, it's them who initially put other passengers lives at risk not Patterson, then when they get away with it we are supposed to happy for them because even though what happened was their doing, they have stolen money & caused a huge crash & immense damage. Director Ruben does alright, I must admit I think the opening titles are very nice to look at as there are alternating aerial shots of a neon lit New York & some moody scenes of a festive New York going about it's business. There's not much action until the end, a few motorbike stunts & a few fights is about it but they are good nicely violent fights though. The out of control train scenes at the end look good although the final crash is obviously a model. The pace is uneven, until the last forty odd minutes it's a fairly slow film but it did keep my interest with some funny dialogue & a fairly engaging story. With a supposed budget of about $68,000,000 Money Train was an absolute disaster at the box-office for Columbia Pictures, the film opened at number 4 at the end of 1995 to a first weekend gross of just over $10 million as it went up against Toy Story (1995), Goldeneye (1995) & Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) all of which opened at or around the same time as Money Train which tanked & ended it's theatrical run with a paltry $35 million. Ouch. The acting is alright with Snipes & Harrelson putting in likable performances while Jennifer Lopez is as awful as ever & luckily she has no more than a cameo role & as such doesn't ruin things that much. Money Train was a disaster at the box-office, it's generally disliked by both critics & the public but I have to say I quite liked it, it isn't any sort of masterpiece but it just about kept my interest & came away from it feeling entertained & feeling I had fun. Worth a watch if you can watch it on telly for free.

    woody harrelson character was so stupid in this movie he was a white brother of a black guy played by Wesley snipes.all he ever did was wasting life living on brothers money & creates trouble for himself & others. the time Jennifer Lopez made and entrance in the film i was relaxed because the stupid comedy of snipes & woody was pissing me off. the money train is about 2 cops friends/bros they work on a N.Y subway station.Charlie plans to rob the money train which collects millions of revenue from the station. despite the action scenes in train & stunts the film fails to deliver . but this film is a timpass movie & will rob you of your money & times if you by it on DVD.that just happened to me.ill avoid Wesley snipes movie from now on the guy has lost it my rating is 3/10.worth looking for J.LO

    One neat way to find out about a certain movie is to go on Youtube and watch a movie review show. This movie, it just so happens, I found out about thanks to the show "Movie Night", a show on the said website from the same user who made the popular show "Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?", and both I find to be very good shows that I recommend you watch. Anyway, let's not waste any more time over Movie Night and get on with the review. This movie, to say the very least, is convoluted. I say convoluted because the relationship between John and Charlie is never stable considering how much time they spend together on the screen. I also say convoluted because the plot of the movie is all over the place. Sure, I get the Money Train idea and that all the revenue from the metro system of New York is transported by train to a company of greedy psycho cops. I get that this lady named Grace Santiago, played by none other than Jennifer Lopez, comes into the movie and plays into the plights of both John and Charlie, not to mention that she apparently is supposed to show her full skin on New Year's Eve in the movie. I even get that the Money Train would affect everybody who plays a part in the film. However, the way the movie presents itself does not make the movie fit very well, even though I couldn't help but smile at some tidbits here and there. Therefore, everything about the movie left me rather mixed as to what the hell was going on. The character development was nothing new here, and the characters were very hard to respect because all they ever do is do the same thing over and over again in different ways. Charlie is a screw-up, John is a conservative trying to get his life straight, Grace is trying to be the aggressive cop, and the boss is trying to threaten everybody while trying to remind everybody that he is the God of all police officers. None of this really worked well for me because that means everybody was too static for any major changes, even though some, and ONLY some, of the dialogue can actually be considered realistic enough to be repeated. Lastly, I want to talk about the premise. Train robberies have been executed better in both stuff before and after the movie came out. However, it doesn't mean that it was the absolute worst either. It did do enough to keep me in my seat even though it was 1-3 hours after midnight, and it didn't have the stupidity that was unfortunately copied by the 2010 movie "The Other Guys", so I actually watched the whole thing. However, serious work needed to be done with the script that was never accomplished. (November 19th, 2011) Grade: E (4.4/10 Rating)

    The film starts out like all those other clich&eacute;d movies and then twenty minutes later it gets worse. The script is poorly written, the music is tedious (this whole film is), and Joseph Ruben is a sh*tty director. The only good film he made is The Forgotten and all those others are good movies to make you sleep if you are insomniac. To waste ten bucks on this film at the cinemas is like insulting your mother then taking it back and slapping yourself for being stupid. And who can forget the horrible acting from nearly everyone, including Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake, and they suck because it seemed like they were auditioning rather than giving a good performance. This film should definitely not be on your list because I can guarantee you that it's a waste of time and money. Jennifer Lopez is the baddest actor to have ever been born because she acts like a rookie who is acting in her first movie and her gross laugh in one of the scenes embarrassed me. The story is weak and clich&eacute;d, no thanks to you Doug Richardson, but most of all it's predictable and you know what the outcome is going to be. I lost respect for Woody Harrelson, who was perfect in Natural Born Killers, because he acts Cr@p and why did he sign up for this movie in the first place? Guess, he must have been poor or something? Robert Blake overreacts lots of times and that is a downside to his acting career. If you have nothing better to do and are counting on watching Money Train then build a sandcastle instead. Two foster brothers, one white and one black, work as transit cops at a local subway station. One has a good life, but the other one has to owe money to some loan shark. He has to pay fifteen grand or his brother is going to die. He has to hijack a money train in order to get the money and secure his brothers life. Working with a hot woman cop, his brother, he has to succeed and nor get caught by a subway owner, Donald Patterson. The action is not all bad but does get boring after a while. To stop yourself from switching off the TV make sure you have some popcorn and friends to share this boring experience with them. I strongly agree with anyone that's is against this film. The film is short, thank God for that, but it seems like it is longer than a millennium. I can go on forever about how bad this film is but I like short and interesting reviews, so I hope this review is both of those. 5/10 - Yuck!

    I don't know what's the film critics' problem with that movie. It is cool job. Film stars Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson which also starred in 1993 hit film "White Men Can't Jump", but that one is not just comedy. It is an action/comedy film which also stars Jennifer Lopez. It is true that plot is non-linear and film have not a point but it's cool Christmas movie. Wesley Snipes has some well done fight scenes, Woody Harrelson is the main reason of the film's humor. I guess one critic said right about that movie, it has everything we asked from an action movie, not a great plot or great dialogs but it has some great action/martial arts scenes and some hilarious moment, it's not kind of a Jackie Chan movie but it's still good. If we return to Jennifer Lopez, her acting was awful but she was just hot and let us forget her awful acting job in a scene where Wesley Snipes banged her, but the boxing scene between them was also good. I loved their chemistry. So, watch these movie! It is a typical action film with some funny moments, great actors (Wesley and Woody), cool action scenes and hot Jennifer Lopez but don't wait any point or even a plot.

    I recall a review about this movie where the critic was so furious saying things like "Where is the train ?", "This is one of the worst train movies!" while he was somehow missing the point, I think he wasn't completely wrong. Actually this climactic sequence looks confused move since the train's heist is nothing but sudden third act's plot not the whole movie and not related to what seemed the basic duel (the subway's burner) which ends strangely earlier. So, with the misleading title you've got to feel disappointed or at least muddled, repining "this is not a train movie" and it is, but you're the last to know ! And yes, some of the bosses are megalomaniac asses, or psychos anyway, but still making the money train's manager as the story's villain wasn't that right or believable especially with his behaviors near the end. Plus that end which wasn't as simple as what this kind of straight action used to present, being for many people as unethical. Yet I have to defend this as originally it's a story about the love between 2, totally different, brothers where one eventually wins love and the other wins well.. money.. dirty money, just to assure the difference between them both as one good cop and one forever hustler whom their argument has no end. (Joseph Ruben) is the man who can make attractive visual work yet nearly always with not attractive scripts ! He's a very good director but surely not the best when it comes to feeling anything wrong with the writing he deals with. So not many times he got scripts as smart as his direction.. and that's the tragedy ! Though, it's a fair action with great cast. Definitely this is better than (Wesley Snipes & Woody Harrelson)'s last movie (White Men Can't Jump) which's not up to this one's lovely time, let alone being one of the silliest movies ever. (Harrelson) did it so well as a childish loser. (Snipes) was charismatic and performed some of the most memorable fights. And it's enough enjoyment to watch a young brunet (Jennifer Lopez). All the elements (the cinematography, editing, and of course the music) was solid maybe more than the main story. Another side of the movie's misfortune is that it came in the year of 1995 where movies by the names of (Die Hard with a Vengeance), (Bad Boys), (Assassins), (Heat), (Se7en), (Braveheart) were produced. Tough I know. Especially with the more successful results from the box office, the critics, or both. But whatever.. I like (Money Train). I think if you forgot about it as a train movie or heist one you'd discover that it's a fun ride with some well-made action, J-lo too and happy end a la' Hollywood where everybody wins and the evil guy goes to hell. Simply wouldn't you like to destroy your pity work, hit your lunatic boss on the jaw, get free money AND get away with it ? Don't answer this.. Just re-watch the movie !

    Money Train is set in New York where Christmas is fast approaching, subway decoy squad cop Charlie (Woody Harrelson) owes $15,000 of gambling debts to Mr. Brown (Scott Sowers) a very unpleasant mobster. Brown wants his money or he'll hurt him, Carlie's foster brother & fellow New York subway decoy squad cop John (Wesley Snipes) gives him the $15,000 but Charlie loses it. If that wasn't bad enough after a cock-up at work both Charlie & John are sacked by their heartless boss Chief Donald Patterson (Robert Blake), out of options Charlie decides to rob the money train that travels from station to station collecting the revenue... Directed by Joseph Ruben this big budget comedy thriller has a pretty bad reputation but I have to say I quite liked it for what it was. The script by Doug Richardson & David Loughery initially sounds like a straight heist film in the vein of The Italian Job (1969) or The First Great Train Robbery (1979) but the majority of the film feels much more like a buddy buddy mismatched partner thriller, the signs are there for all to see. The mismatched partners with one black & one white which leads to all sorts of amusing racial gags, the fact they are both on the edge & have personal issues but are basically good guy's, there's a pointless romantic subplot & there's several bad guy's that they bring down. There are lots of dialogue scenes all of which seem to cram as many 'F' swear words in as possible, the subplots with Jennifer Lopez & the Torch villain are not needed, Charlie's gambling debts are all but forgotten about by the end & there are scene that are very hard to believe. A cop turning up drunk for work for instance is instant dismissal, starting a fight with your fellow police officers would also get you the sack & there's just not much factual accuracy here. Having said that I quite liked it, I did think certain parts of it were amusing, some of the one-liners & dialogue worked, there's are some impressive fights & a cool train crash at the end although the actually robbery isn't that clever or well thought out. The character's are a mixed bag, Charlie & John are likable but it's them who decided to rob the train in the first place, it's them who initially put other passengers lives at risk not Patterson, then when they get away with it we are supposed to happy for them because even though what happened was their doing, they have stolen money & caused a huge crash & immense damage. Director Ruben does alright, I must admit I think the opening titles are very nice to look at as there are alternating aerial shots of a neon lit New York & some moody scenes of a festive New York going about it's business. There's not much action until the end, a few motorbike stunts & a few fights is about it but they are good nicely violent fights though. The out of control train scenes at the end look good although the final crash is obviously a model. The pace is uneven, until the last forty odd minutes it's a fairly slow film but it did keep my interest with some funny dialogue & a fairly engaging story. With a supposed budget of about $68,000,000 Money Train was an absolute disaster at the box-office for Columbia Pictures, the film opened at number 4 at the end of 1995 to a first weekend gross of just over $10 million as it went up against Toy Story (1995), Goldeneye (1995) & Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) all of which opened at or around the same time as Money Train which tanked & ended it's theatrical run with a paltry $35 million. Ouch. The acting is alright with Snipes & Harrelson putting in likable performances while Jennifer Lopez is as awful as ever & luckily she has no more than a cameo role & as such doesn't ruin things that much. Money Train was a disaster at the box-office, it's generally disliked by both critics & the public but I have to say I quite liked it, it isn't any sort of masterpiece but it just about kept my interest & came away from it feeling entertained & feeling I had fun. Worth a watch if you can watch it on telly for free.
