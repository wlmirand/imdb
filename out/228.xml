  With the aid of the Enterprise crew, Admiral Kirk must stop an old nemesis, Khan Noonien Singh, from using his son's life-generating device, the Genesis Device, as the ultimate weapon.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The Federation along with a group scientists are collaborating on a project called Genesis. Which is a plan to bring a dead planet to life. So far the preliminary experiments have been a success. Now for the next phase which is to actually bring a planet to life, a dead planet is required. So the Federation sends a vessel, the Reliant to find one and it's first officer is former Enterprise crew member Pavel Chekov. They come across what appears to be a dead planet in the Ceti Alpha system. But the sensors detect something which makes it not a dead planet. But the Captain thinks maybe they can remove it, so he and Chekov go and investigate. But they find what appears to be a life pod. When Chekov sees something, he tells the Captain they should leave. But they are captured by the inhabitants. When they meet the leader, Chekov recognizes him as Khan, the bio engineered human from the late 20th century whom Kirk found 15 years ago. Who tried to take over the Enterprise and kill Kirk. But...

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a terrific Star Trek film as it brings an old nemesis from the series that only made a short appearance and made a big blockbuster film. The film takes the smarter route then the first as they make it into an action-packed adventure film. The enterprise crew has gone their own ways, but when an old threat returns to cause trouble, Kirk assembles his crew to go after his old nemesis, Khan, before he uses the Genesis program that his son built as a weapon. Can Kirk win and what must he sacrifice to stop Khan? This film is such a better film then the first as the first is like one long episode and this has action, adventure, excitement, and a great villain. Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is an excellent villain and the best in the series and one of the best all-time in cinema. He is just a perfect villain. The story is better as the Genesis project (able to make life on deserted land or on a planet), is the most precious thing right now as it could be an incredible thing to change life or a weapon of mass destruction. The ending is a sad one as to stop Khan and save the ship, Spock kills himself and Kirk is heart broken. He is then shot out of the ship and lands on the nearest planet which Genesis just rebuild. This is an excellent movie and a near perfect job. By far the best out of the original and one of the best Star Trek films ever. Me: A-

    I may not be a Star Trek fan, but I usually enjoy watching the movies. Most of them are pretty good while others are very disappointing, so that's why I'm going to continue reviewing them since Star Trek Into Darkness was released starting with this second installment, "The Krath of Khan". I gotta say, out of all the entries of the franchise, this is easily the best Star Trek film I've seen in almost all my life. Seeing as how it's being known for it's memorable quote "KHAN!!!!!!!", there is absolutely no flaws at all and I'm gonna praise this epic film. The story is very compelling and is a lot closer to the spirit of Star Trek than the original film should've been. It also has a sad moment where Spock dies which is an example of tear-jerking. The script is smart and very inventive and the pacing is very good. The cast from the original film delivers a lot of solid performances especially William Shatner, Leonard Nemoy and Ricardo Montalban as Khan, who is downright creepy and frightening for a Star Trek villain. The scenery and visuals are wonderful to see, but the best part is the music score from James Horner, one of my favorite music composers. He has done some great work (including Apollo 13, Braveheart, Avatar, etc.) and his score for this film is no exception. Overall, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a masterpiece and an epic continuation that saved the franchise back at the early 1980s. Recommended to Star Trek fans who grew up and a thumbs up from me!

    I've never been a major Star Trek fan growing up. I watched a few episodes of the original 60s show and even a lot of the Next Generation but I've never gained a mega-interest in the show. The movies on the other hand, I've started to really get into with the J.J Abrams reboot getting me engaged in the franchise. I started to watch all of the original Trek films in order starting with the Motion Picture, which I was incredibly bored by as were a lot of people even Trekkies. The critical failure of the Motion Picture forced creator Gene Roddenberry out of creative control of the franchise and the series was taken in a new direction. With Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, director Nicholas Meyer crafts an adventure that is both cerebral and action-packed, with the film resembling more of the original series. Just like most people, Star Trek II is my favourite in the series and one of my favourite sci- fi films as well. As James T. Kirk's birthday arrives, he is convinced by Dr. McCoy to go back into command over the Enterprise with Spock agreeing. Meanwhile, Chekov, now serving on the U.S.S Reliant, search for a desolate planet to use as a staging ground for testing the Genesis device which can terraform a world and make it habitable. They arrive on one candidate planet named Ceti Alpha V where Chekov and the Reliant's captain are captured by Khan Noonien Singh, who had been marooned on the planet for fifteen years after Kirk had exiled him and his team of genetically engineered supermen there. Khan now vows vengeance on the Admiral for marooning him and causing the death of his wife. He then implants Chekov and the captain of the Reliant with mind control eels, making them susceptible to his will and allowing him command over the Reliant. When Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise embark on a three year training course, they are ambushed by Khan and his team and become embroiled in a ploy involving his demands for the Genesis device. A sequel to the original series episode 'Space Seed', Wrath of Khan features some of the strongest character building moments of the series. The conflict between Kirk and Khan is unique in that the two never meet face-to-face in this film. A lot of their scenes come from the two duelling it out via communication device. A lot of this is brought to life by the efforts of William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban's performances. Kirk is a more fully realized character in this endeavour. In the show, he was portrayed more as cocky womaniser who always saved the day and triumphed in the end. Here, he realizes what it's like to fail or at least win but with a price. He also discovers that he has a son as a result of a fling with an old flame and that has consequences for his well-being. Ricardo Montalban froths at the mouth as Khan, a truly worthy villain to the Trekverse. His revenge-bent monologues have made him a popular villain in science-fiction to quote and has made him one of Star Trek's most formidable foes. The visuals in Wrath of Khan are competent for a film with a limited budget and the costumes are an improvement over the first film's bland grey uniform code. The redness of the film also does a good job of highlighting the grim tone of the film. It's also important to discuss one of the most important elements of the film which is Spock's death. The death of the fan favourite in the franchise came as a shock to the fanbase and has become one of the biggest geek-out moments in film. The death was handled very well especially in the goodbye scene between Spock and Kirk. Even though he returned in the next film, his death was still played out very well and even the following film didn't damage the moment here. Star Trek Into Darkness recently incorporated this scene along with a lot of elements from this picture into it but did it without damaging the source material. Star Trek II is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, Star Trek films. It's mixture of emotion, cerebral integrity, adequate visuals and character development make this a strong entry in the franchise and one of the most significant science-fiction pictures of its time. It made up for the ponderous dull-fest that was the Motion Picture and is still a film that I watch every now and again.

    Firstly, we have to take the release year of this movie into consider, 1982, the year before Star War v released. Although the scenes of star war seems more magnificent than ours here, we can't expect more when we make it compete with one of the Top 10 movies in IMDb. The scenes of this film here are well connected with its plots. Not as tediously long as the debut of Star Trek series, not seem like as crude as which is without editing, and they accurately match the background musics, which make the whole movie more real seen. Furthermore, the story this time is more interesting and logical than the first one of this series. The villain is reasonable being, the story line is clear to follow and the conversation is much more meaningful. The most of the scenes are acted in the Enterprise and other two ships, but it doesn't make the film fail to attract audiences with the intense fights. Finally, the death of Spock really made me mist my eyes, the sacrifice is moving, it is overwhelming when the coffin was sent out to the space. However, the journey of Enterprise is not finished yet, we will look forward.

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan **1/2 (out of 4) 112 mins/ 12 Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Bibi Besch, Kirstie Alley, Ricardo Montalban Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: With his old crew on a training exercise, Admiral Kirk is forced to do battle with his old rival, Khan. JJ's Verdict: On the surface, 'Wrath of Khan' seems the perfect sci-fi film. From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series: Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour. Ricardo Montalban puts in a performance only second in his career to 'The Naked Gun', in terms of sheer entertainment. His character, Khan, is terrifying and ruthless and Montalban adds a brilliant sophistication to his character with his charming Mexican accent. In this film, as a viewer, you get a better sense of the threat to the Enterprise crew. Despite these positives, the films middle section is painfully slow and despite having a fairly simple plot, its ending, however satisfying it may be, is awfully confusing. It is a huge disappointment that the supposed space battle is very tame and that there is no final confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Probably better than its predecessor and clever in parts, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is just an attempt at copying the style that is so loved in George Lucas' 'Star Wars'.

    I wanted to immediately give this film a 10 out of 10 and then I told myself to sit back and actually judge this film. This is the best Star Trek Film in my eyes followed First Contact and by some peoples surprise Into Darkness. Anyway this is one of the Best Science Fiction films ever and I think is actually in my top 10 or 15. It has a great plot and brings back a villain from the Original nods. This one is probably one for either fans or non fans of Star Trek. Khan is by far the best Trek villain and is one of the most memorable film villains in movie history. He had a back story and this really showed watch Trek could be and had one of the greatest endings in history. I keep saying Trek in this film, but when this film is the best I am gonna use the word Trek a lot and if this was the worst one, which it isn't, I would use Trek a lot too. Anyway this is a great film and is a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it. This is the definitive Trek film and one of the Best Science Fiction films of all time.

    Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline that improves immensely on the first Star Trek movie,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,and you can even tell from the acting that the cast was more positive about this script than they were for the first movie.The thing I liked best about this was that it felt more cinematic,like something they couldn't do on the television series,thats the only reason films for TV shows should be made,to have a much larger situation,the first movie just feels like a long episode of Star Trek,but this movie is really what a movie based on a television series needs to be.Fans of the original Star Trek series will not be let down by the second installment. The Enterprise must work together to stop a nemesis of Captain Kirk from using his sons device,the Genesis,which is able to destroy any planet in the galaxy.

    Watching Abrams' latest tepid outing on the big screen inspired me to re-watch the film from which he stole so much material. And it's better by an even vaster margin than I remembered. The thing about TWOK is that it's not without its minor plot-holes or inconsistencies, but it has the energy and compelling, driving core story to make them seem irrelevant. It's not the sumptuous visual feast modern CGI can turn out either... but again, that's to the good, as it also has none of the tacky, moronic excess that so characterizes the CGI era. Its effects are convincing and restrained, doing what they need to do and otherwise keeping out of the story's way. What brings TWOK to the apex of the Trek universe is that it embodies the basic premise Trek was original built around: the premise of telling great stories that *just happened* to take place in an SF setting. One of the finest episodes of the original series was "Balance of Terror," a tense destroyer-versus-sub duel that could have come out of the Pacific Theatre of WW2 but for its SF trappings. TWOK riffed on this and created probably the best starship duel ever put to film, adding the original series' best-ever bad guy to the mix and putting it all together with masterful pacing and momentum. This is the difference that writing makes between a mediocre film and a great one. It was something of a curse, ironically, on the film franchise that they made it all look so deceptively straightforward and simple in TWOK. The Trek films never recovered this magic, never climbed these heights again, because too many subsequent directors -- Abrams now among them -- just didn't get what made the franchise's greatest instalment work so well. If the Next Generation crew ultimately proved the best in the televised medium, the original cast still owns the silver screen on the strength of this film.

    I just saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan for the first time. It had a lot of faulty logic in it. It felt like a bad sixties B-movie. 1) Why didn't Chekov get beamed up as soon as he was in danger? 2) Why didn't they happen weapons? 3) How could Khan have survived with those people so many years on a decrepit planet? 4) How could Khan's men just take over a starfleet ship? They are clearly outnumbered and outgunned. 5) How could Khan and his men know how to fly a starfleet ship? Wouldn't they have security measures to use things on the ship? 6) How did Khan have time to go the science station and kill all those people? 7) Why wouldn't the enterprise have its shield up at all times? What if they got shot out of nowhere? 8) When Khan is beaming up the genesis, the Star Trek crew has a good 15 seconds to move that out of the way. Instead, Kirk yells "Khan!" for 15 seconds. 9) What was Khan's plan with the genesis? How would he even know how to use it? Bad Acting-wise: 1) Chekov and that black guy. Especially, the black guy when he is resisting killing Kirk. 2) Khan is hokey a lot of the time. 3) People saying their last words, then dying. 4) Kirk's yelling of "Khan!" was as bad as Darth Vader yelling "No!" in Episode III.

    The Star Trek feature film debut had its fair share of ambition and spectacle, but was a lumbering beast of a film that proved bewildering and somewhat dull. It makes for a decent space opera, but in their wisdom, the filmmakers realized that they needed to spice things up for the inevitable sequel. Even at the expense of kicking Gene Roddenberry - the revered creator of the franchise - to the curb. Thus, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came into fruition. Coming after the classic Trek episode Space Seed, this film brings back Khan Noonien Singh as the story's nemesis, and the whole thing becomes a rocketing thrill ride from then on. Space battles are fairly simple and short, but they are still quite spectacular to watch, especially with the colorful backgrounds of the Mutara Nebula. The pacing is even throughout, and the film boasts some remarkable iconic moments that all audiences can recognize and relate to. The story is appealing; even though there is plenty of action and peril in the movie, it has enough breathing space for quality characterization and theme development. A good chunk of room is left for Kirk contemplating his old age and mortality, and thanks to the parallels of the Genesis torpedo and the film's ultimate solution, strong themes of death and rebirth emerge very subtly. Even without such elements, the characters come off as being well-rounded and enjoyable. The story covers some fascinating concepts, and is well-structured. This film is shot and edited with quality precision. Acting is phenomenal: while it is always a joy to see William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the rest of the crew in action, Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n steals the show as the villain, with a powerful and iconic performance. Writing is great, featuring plenty of great memorable lines. The production has a fine array of solid sets, props, costumes, and special effects (costumes in particular are much improved from the last Trek picture). Music, despite deviating from the classic Trek themes, has a catchy melodic charm of its own. Of this film, I can say this. Of all the Trek films I have known, this still the most...endearing. 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

However, the journey of Enterprise is not finished yet, we will look forward.

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan **1/2 (out of 4) 112 mins/ 12 Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Bibi Besch, Kirstie Alley, Ricardo Montalban Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: With his old crew on a training exercise, Admiral Kirk is forced to do battle with his old rival, Khan. JJ's Verdict: On the surface, 'Wrath of Khan' seems the perfect sci-fi film. From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series: Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour. Ricardo Montalban puts in a performance only second in his career to 'The Naked Gun', in terms of sheer entertainment. His character, Khan, is terrifying and ruthless and Montalban adds a brilliant sophistication to his character with his charming Mexican accent. In this film, as a viewer, you get a better sense of the threat to the Enterprise crew. Despite these positives, the films middle section is painfully slow and despite having a fairly simple plot, its ending, however satisfying it may be, is awfully confusing. It is a huge disappointment that the supposed space battle is very tame and that there is no final confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Probably better than its predecessor and clever in parts, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is just an attempt at copying the style that is so loved in George Lucas' 'Star Wars'.

    I wanted to immediately give this film a 10 out of 10 and then I told myself to sit back and actually judge this film. This is the best Star Trek Film in my eyes followed First Contact and by some peoples surprise Into Darkness. Anyway this is one of the Best Science Fiction films ever and I think is actually in my top 10 or 15. It has a great plot and brings back a villain from the Original nods. This one is probably one for either fans or non fans of Star Trek. Khan is by far the best Trek villain and is one of the most memorable film villains in movie history. He had a back story and this really showed watch Trek could be and had one of the greatest endings in history. I keep saying Trek in this film, but when this film is the best I am gonna use the word Trek a lot and if this was the worst one, which it isn't, I would use Trek a lot too. Anyway this is a great film and is a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it. This is the definitive Trek film and one of the Best Science Fiction films of all time.

    Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline that improves immensely on the first Star Trek movie,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,and you can even tell from the acting that the cast was more positive about this script than they were for the first movie.The thing I liked best about this was that it felt more cinematic,like something they couldn't do on the television series,thats the only reason films for TV shows should be made,to have a much larger situation,the first movie just feels like a long episode of Star Trek,but this movie is really what a movie based on a television series needs to be.Fans of the original Star Trek series will not be let down by the second installment. The Enterprise must work together to stop a nemesis of Captain Kirk from using his sons device,the Genesis,which is able to destroy any planet in the galaxy.

    Watching Abrams' latest tepid outing on the big screen inspired me to re-watch the film from which he stole so much material. And it's better by an even vaster margin than I remembered. The thing about TWOK is that it's not without its minor plot-holes or inconsistencies, but it has the energy and compelling, driving core story to make them seem irrelevant. It's not the sumptuous visual feast modern CGI can turn out either... but again, that's to the good, as it also has none of the tacky, moronic excess that so characterizes the CGI era. Its effects are convincing and restrained, doing what they need to do and otherwise keeping out of the story's way. What brings TWOK to the apex of the Trek universe is that it embodies the basic premise Trek was original built around: the premise of telling great stories that *just happened* to take place in an SF setting. One of the finest episodes of the original series was "Balance of Terror," a tense destroyer-versus-sub duel that could have come out of the Pacific Theatre of WW2 but for its SF trappings. TWOK riffed on this and created probably the best starship duel ever put to film, adding the original series' best-ever bad guy to the mix and putting it all together with masterful pacing and momentum. This is the difference that writing makes between a mediocre film and a great one. It was something of a curse, ironically, on the film franchise that they made it all look so deceptively straightforward and simple in TWOK. The Trek films never recovered this magic, never climbed these heights again, because too many subsequent directors -- Abrams now among them -- just didn't get what made the franchise's greatest instalment work so well. If the Next Generation crew ultimately proved the best in the televised medium, the original cast still owns the silver screen on the strength of this film.

    I just saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan for the first time. It had a lot of faulty logic in it. It felt like a bad sixties B-movie. 1) Why didn't Chekov get beamed up as soon as he was in danger? 2) Why didn't they happen weapons? 3) How could Khan have survived with those people so many years on a decrepit planet? 4) How could Khan's men just take over a starfleet ship? They are clearly outnumbered and outgunned. 5) How could Khan and his men know how to fly a starfleet ship? Wouldn't they have security measures to use things on the ship? 6) How did Khan have time to go the science station and kill all those people? 7) Why wouldn't the enterprise have its shield up at all times? What if they got shot out of nowhere? 8) When Khan is beaming up the genesis, the Star Trek crew has a good 15 seconds to move that out of the way. Instead, Kirk yells "Khan!" for 15 seconds. 9) What was Khan's plan with the genesis? How would he even know how to use it? Bad Acting-wise: 1) Chekov and that black guy. Especially, the black guy when he is resisting killing Kirk. 2) Khan is hokey a lot of the time. 3) People saying their last words, then dying. 4) Kirk's yelling of "Khan!" was as bad as Darth Vader yelling "No!" in Episode III.

    The Star Trek feature film debut had its fair share of ambition and spectacle, but was a lumbering beast of a film that proved bewildering and somewhat dull. It makes for a decent space opera, but in their wisdom, the filmmakers realized that they needed to spice things up for the inevitable sequel. Even at the expense of kicking Gene Roddenberry - the revered creator of the franchise - to the curb. Thus, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came into fruition. Coming after the classic Trek episode Space Seed, this film brings back Khan Noonien Singh as the story's nemesis, and the whole thing becomes a rocketing thrill ride from then on. Space battles are fairly simple and short, but they are still quite spectacular to watch, especially with the colorful backgrounds of the Mutara Nebula. The pacing is even throughout, and the film boasts some remarkable iconic moments that all audiences can recognize and relate to. The story is appealing; even though there is plenty of action and peril in the movie, it has enough breathing space for quality characterization and theme development. A good chunk of room is left for Kirk contemplating his old age and mortality, and thanks to the parallels of the Genesis torpedo and the film's ultimate solution, strong themes of death and rebirth emerge very subtly. Even without such elements, the characters come off as being well-rounded and enjoyable. The story covers some fascinating concepts, and is well-structured. This film is shot and edited with quality precision. Acting is phenomenal: while it is always a joy to see William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the rest of the crew in action, Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n steals the show as the villain, with a powerful and iconic performance. Writing is great, featuring plenty of great memorable lines. The production has a fine array of solid sets, props, costumes, and special effects (costumes in particular are much improved from the last Trek picture). Music, despite deviating from the classic Trek themes, has a catchy melodic charm of its own. Of this film, I can say this. Of all the Trek films I have known, this still the most...endearing. 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a terrific Star Trek film as it brings an old nemesis from the series that only made a short appearance and made a big blockbuster film. The film takes the smarter route then the first as they make it into an action-packed adventure film. The enterprise crew has gone their own ways, but when an old threat returns to cause trouble, Kirk assembles his crew to go after his old nemesis, Khan, before he uses the Genesis program that his son built as a weapon. Can Kirk win and what must he sacrifice to stop Khan? This film is such a better film then the first as the first is like one long episode and this has action, adventure, excitement, and a great villain. Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is an excellent villain and the best in the series and one of the best all-time in cinema. He is just a perfect villain. The story is better as the Genesis project (able to make life on deserted land or on a planet), is the most precious thing right now as it could be an incredible thing to change life or a weapon of mass destruction. The ending is a sad one as to stop Khan and save the ship, Spock kills himself and Kirk is heart broken. He is then shot out of the ship and lands on the nearest planet which Genesis just rebuild. This is an excellent movie and a near perfect job. By far the best out of the original and one of the best Star Trek films ever. Me: A-

    I may not be a Star Trek fan, but I usually enjoy watching the movies. Most of them are pretty good while others are very disappointing, so that's why I'm going to continue reviewing them since Star Trek Into Darkness was released starting with this second installment, "The Krath of Khan". I gotta say, out of all the entries of the franchise, this is easily the best Star Trek film I've seen in almost all my life. Seeing as how it's being known for it's memorable quote "KHAN!!!!!!!", there is absolutely no flaws at all and I'm gonna praise this epic film. The story is very compelling and is a lot closer to the spirit of Star Trek than the original film should've been. It also has a sad moment where Spock dies which is an example of tear-jerking. The script is smart and very inventive and the pacing is very good. The cast from the original film delivers a lot of solid performances especially William Shatner, Leonard Nemoy and Ricardo Montalban as Khan, who is downright creepy and frightening for a Star Trek villain. The scenery and visuals are wonderful to see, but the best part is the music score from James Horner, one of my favorite music composers. He has done some great work (including Apollo 13, Braveheart, Avatar, etc.) and his score for this film is no exception. Overall, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a masterpiece and an epic continuation that saved the franchise back at the early 1980s. Recommended to Star Trek fans who grew up and a thumbs up from me!

    I've never been a major Star Trek fan growing up. I watched a few episodes of the original 60s show and even a lot of the Next Generation but I've never gained a mega-interest in the show. The movies on the other hand, I've started to really get into with the J.J Abrams reboot getting me engaged in the franchise. I started to watch all of the original Trek films in order starting with the Motion Picture, which I was incredibly bored by as were a lot of people even Trekkies. The critical failure of the Motion Picture forced creator Gene Roddenberry out of creative control of the franchise and the series was taken in a new direction. With Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, director Nicholas Meyer crafts an adventure that is both cerebral and action-packed, with the film resembling more of the original series. Just like most people, Star Trek II is my favourite in the series and one of my favourite sci- fi films as well. As James T. Kirk's birthday arrives, he is convinced by Dr. McCoy to go back into command over the Enterprise with Spock agreeing. Meanwhile, Chekov, now serving on the U.S.S Reliant, search for a desolate planet to use as a staging ground for testing the Genesis device which can terraform a world and make it habitable. They arrive on one candidate planet named Ceti Alpha V where Chekov and the Reliant's captain are captured by Khan Noonien Singh, who had been marooned on the planet for fifteen years after Kirk had exiled him and his team of genetically engineered supermen there. Khan now vows vengeance on the Admiral for marooning him and causing the death of his wife. He then implants Chekov and the captain of the Reliant with mind control eels, making them susceptible to his will and allowing him command over the Reliant. When Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise embark on a three year training course, they are ambushed by Khan and his team and become embroiled in a ploy involving his demands for the Genesis device. A sequel to the original series episode 'Space Seed', Wrath of Khan features some of the strongest character building moments of the series. The conflict between Kirk and Khan is unique in that the two never meet face-to-face in this film. A lot of their scenes come from the two duelling it out via communication device. A lot of this is brought to life by the efforts of William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban's performances. Kirk is a more fully realized character in this endeavour. In the show, he was portrayed more as cocky womaniser who always saved the day and triumphed in the end. Here, he realizes what it's like to fail or at least win but with a price. He also discovers that he has a son as a result of a fling with an old flame and that has consequences for his well-being. Ricardo Montalban froths at the mouth as Khan, a truly worthy villain to the Trekverse. His revenge-bent monologues have made him a popular villain in science-fiction to quote and has made him one of Star Trek's most formidable foes. The visuals in Wrath of Khan are competent for a film with a limited budget and the costumes are an improvement over the first film's bland grey uniform code. The redness of the film also does a good job of highlighting the grim tone of the film. It's also important to discuss one of the most important elements of the film which is Spock's death. The death of the fan favourite in the franchise came as a shock to the fanbase and has become one of the biggest geek-out moments in film. The death was handled very well especially in the goodbye scene between Spock and Kirk. Even though he returned in the next film, his death was still played out very well and even the following film didn't damage the moment here. Star Trek Into Darkness recently incorporated this scene along with a lot of elements from this picture into it but did it without damaging the source material. Star Trek II is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, Star Trek films. It's mixture of emotion, cerebral integrity, adequate visuals and character development make this a strong entry in the franchise and one of the most significant science-fiction pictures of its time. It made up for the ponderous dull-fest that was the Motion Picture and is still a film that I watch every now and again.

    Firstly, we have to take the release year of this movie into consider, 1982, the year before Star War v released. Although the scenes of star war seems more magnificent than ours here, we can't expect more when we make it compete with one of the Top 10 movies in IMDb. The scenes of this film here are well connected with its plots. Not as tediously long as the debut of Star Trek series, not seem like as crude as which is without editing, and they accurately match the background musics, which make the whole movie more real seen. Furthermore, the story this time is more interesting and logical than the first one of this series. The villain is reasonable being, the story line is clear to follow and the conversation is much more meaningful. The most of the scenes are acted in the Enterprise and other two ships, but it doesn't make the film fail to attract audiences with the intense fights. Finally, the death of Spock really made me mist my eyes, the sacrifice is moving, it is overwhelming when the coffin was sent out to the space. However, the journey of Enterprise is not finished yet, we will look forward.

The enterprise crew has gone their own ways, but when an old threat returns to cause trouble, Kirk assembles his crew to go after his old nemesis, Khan, before he uses the Genesis program that his son built as a weapon. Can Kirk win and what must he sacrifice to stop Khan? This film is such a better film then the first as the first is like one long episode and this has action, adventure, excitement, and a great villain. Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is an excellent villain and the best in the series and one of the best all-time in cinema. He is just a perfect villain. The story is better as the Genesis project (able to make life on deserted land or on a planet), is the most precious thing right now as it could be an incredible thing to change life or a weapon of mass destruction. The ending is a sad one as to stop Khan and save the ship, Spock kills himself and Kirk is heart broken. He is then shot out of the ship and lands on the nearest planet which Genesis just rebuild. This is an excellent movie and a near perfect job. By far the best out of the original and one of the best Star Trek films ever. Me: A-

    I may not be a Star Trek fan, but I usually enjoy watching the movies. Most of them are pretty good while others are very disappointing, so that's why I'm going to continue reviewing them since Star Trek Into Darkness was released starting with this second installment, "The Krath of Khan". I gotta say, out of all the entries of the franchise, this is easily the best Star Trek film I've seen in almost all my life. Seeing as how it's being known for it's memorable quote "KHAN!!!!!!!", there is absolutely no flaws at all and I'm gonna praise this epic film. The story is very compelling and is a lot closer to the spirit of Star Trek than the original film should've been. It also has a sad moment where Spock dies which is an example of tear-jerking. The script is smart and very inventive and the pacing is very good. The cast from the original film delivers a lot of solid performances especially William Shatner, Leonard Nemoy and Ricardo Montalban as Khan, who is downright creepy and frightening for a Star Trek villain. The scenery and visuals are wonderful to see, but the best part is the music score from James Horner, one of my favorite music composers. He has done some great work (including Apollo 13, Braveheart, Avatar, etc.) and his score for this film is no exception. Overall, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a masterpiece and an epic continuation that saved the franchise back at the early 1980s. Recommended to Star Trek fans who grew up and a thumbs up from me!

    I've never been a major Star Trek fan growing up. I watched a few episodes of the original 60s show and even a lot of the Next Generation but I've never gained a mega-interest in the show. The movies on the other hand, I've started to really get into with the J.J Abrams reboot getting me engaged in the franchise. I started to watch all of the original Trek films in order starting with the Motion Picture, which I was incredibly bored by as were a lot of people even Trekkies. The critical failure of the Motion Picture forced creator Gene Roddenberry out of creative control of the franchise and the series was taken in a new direction. With Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, director Nicholas Meyer crafts an adventure that is both cerebral and action-packed, with the film resembling more of the original series. Just like most people, Star Trek II is my favourite in the series and one of my favourite sci- fi films as well. As James T. Kirk's birthday arrives, he is convinced by Dr. McCoy to go back into command over the Enterprise with Spock agreeing. Meanwhile, Chekov, now serving on the U.S.S Reliant, search for a desolate planet to use as a staging ground for testing the Genesis device which can terraform a world and make it habitable. They arrive on one candidate planet named Ceti Alpha V where Chekov and the Reliant's captain are captured by Khan Noonien Singh, who had been marooned on the planet for fifteen years after Kirk had exiled him and his team of genetically engineered supermen there. Khan now vows vengeance on the Admiral for marooning him and causing the death of his wife. He then implants Chekov and the captain of the Reliant with mind control eels, making them susceptible to his will and allowing him command over the Reliant. When Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise embark on a three year training course, they are ambushed by Khan and his team and become embroiled in a ploy involving his demands for the Genesis device. A sequel to the original series episode 'Space Seed', Wrath of Khan features some of the strongest character building moments of the series. The conflict between Kirk and Khan is unique in that the two never meet face-to-face in this film. A lot of their scenes come from the two duelling it out via communication device. A lot of this is brought to life by the efforts of William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban's performances. Kirk is a more fully realized character in this endeavour. In the show, he was portrayed more as cocky womaniser who always saved the day and triumphed in the end. Here, he realizes what it's like to fail or at least win but with a price. He also discovers that he has a son as a result of a fling with an old flame and that has consequences for his well-being. Ricardo Montalban froths at the mouth as Khan, a truly worthy villain to the Trekverse. His revenge-bent monologues have made him a popular villain in science-fiction to quote and has made him one of Star Trek's most formidable foes. The visuals in Wrath of Khan are competent for a film with a limited budget and the costumes are an improvement over the first film's bland grey uniform code. The redness of the film also does a good job of highlighting the grim tone of the film. It's also important to discuss one of the most important elements of the film which is Spock's death. The death of the fan favourite in the franchise came as a shock to the fanbase and has become one of the biggest geek-out moments in film. The death was handled very well especially in the goodbye scene between Spock and Kirk. Even though he returned in the next film, his death was still played out very well and even the following film didn't damage the moment here. Star Trek Into Darkness recently incorporated this scene along with a lot of elements from this picture into it but did it without damaging the source material. Star Trek II is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, Star Trek films. It's mixture of emotion, cerebral integrity, adequate visuals and character development make this a strong entry in the franchise and one of the most significant science-fiction pictures of its time. It made up for the ponderous dull-fest that was the Motion Picture and is still a film that I watch every now and again.

    Firstly, we have to take the release year of this movie into consider, 1982, the year before Star War v released. Although the scenes of star war seems more magnificent than ours here, we can't expect more when we make it compete with one of the Top 10 movies in IMDb. The scenes of this film here are well connected with its plots. Not as tediously long as the debut of Star Trek series, not seem like as crude as which is without editing, and they accurately match the background musics, which make the whole movie more real seen. Furthermore, the story this time is more interesting and logical than the first one of this series. The villain is reasonable being, the story line is clear to follow and the conversation is much more meaningful. The most of the scenes are acted in the Enterprise and other two ships, but it doesn't make the film fail to attract audiences with the intense fights. Finally, the death of Spock really made me mist my eyes, the sacrifice is moving, it is overwhelming when the coffin was sent out to the space. However, the journey of Enterprise is not finished yet, we will look forward.

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan **1/2 (out of 4) 112 mins/ 12 Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Bibi Besch, Kirstie Alley, Ricardo Montalban Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: With his old crew on a training exercise, Admiral Kirk is forced to do battle with his old rival, Khan. JJ's Verdict: On the surface, 'Wrath of Khan' seems the perfect sci-fi film. From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series: Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour. Ricardo Montalban puts in a performance only second in his career to 'The Naked Gun', in terms of sheer entertainment. His character, Khan, is terrifying and ruthless and Montalban adds a brilliant sophistication to his character with his charming Mexican accent. In this film, as a viewer, you get a better sense of the threat to the Enterprise crew. Despite these positives, the films middle section is painfully slow and despite having a fairly simple plot, its ending, however satisfying it may be, is awfully confusing. It is a huge disappointment that the supposed space battle is very tame and that there is no final confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Probably better than its predecessor and clever in parts, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is just an attempt at copying the style that is so loved in George Lucas' 'Star Wars'.

    I wanted to immediately give this film a 10 out of 10 and then I told myself to sit back and actually judge this film. This is the best Star Trek Film in my eyes followed First Contact and by some peoples surprise Into Darkness. Anyway this is one of the Best Science Fiction films ever and I think is actually in my top 10 or 15. It has a great plot and brings back a villain from the Original nods. This one is probably one for either fans or non fans of Star Trek. Khan is by far the best Trek villain and is one of the most memorable film villains in movie history. He had a back story and this really showed watch Trek could be and had one of the greatest endings in history. I keep saying Trek in this film, but when this film is the best I am gonna use the word Trek a lot and if this was the worst one, which it isn't, I would use Trek a lot too. Anyway this is a great film and is a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it. This is the definitive Trek film and one of the Best Science Fiction films of all time.

    Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline that improves immensely on the first Star Trek movie,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,and you can even tell from the acting that the cast was more positive about this script than they were for the first movie.The thing I liked best about this was that it felt more cinematic,like something they couldn't do on the television series,thats the only reason films for TV shows should be made,to have a much larger situation,the first movie just feels like a long episode of Star Trek,but this movie is really what a movie based on a television series needs to be.Fans of the original Star Trek series will not be let down by the second installment. The Enterprise must work together to stop a nemesis of Captain Kirk from using his sons device,the Genesis,which is able to destroy any planet in the galaxy.

    Watching Abrams' latest tepid outing on the big screen inspired me to re-watch the film from which he stole so much material. And it's better by an even vaster margin than I remembered. The thing about TWOK is that it's not without its minor plot-holes or inconsistencies, but it has the energy and compelling, driving core story to make them seem irrelevant. It's not the sumptuous visual feast modern CGI can turn out either... but again, that's to the good, as it also has none of the tacky, moronic excess that so characterizes the CGI era. Its effects are convincing and restrained, doing what they need to do and otherwise keeping out of the story's way. What brings TWOK to the apex of the Trek universe is that it embodies the basic premise Trek was original built around: the premise of telling great stories that *just happened* to take place in an SF setting. One of the finest episodes of the original series was "Balance of Terror," a tense destroyer-versus-sub duel that could have come out of the Pacific Theatre of WW2 but for its SF trappings. TWOK riffed on this and created probably the best starship duel ever put to film, adding the original series' best-ever bad guy to the mix and putting it all together with masterful pacing and momentum. This is the difference that writing makes between a mediocre film and a great one. It was something of a curse, ironically, on the film franchise that they made it all look so deceptively straightforward and simple in TWOK. The Trek films never recovered this magic, never climbed these heights again, because too many subsequent directors -- Abrams now among them -- just didn't get what made the franchise's greatest instalment work so well. If the Next Generation crew ultimately proved the best in the televised medium, the original cast still owns the silver screen on the strength of this film.

    I just saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan for the first time. It had a lot of faulty logic in it. It felt like a bad sixties B-movie. 1) Why didn't Chekov get beamed up as soon as he was in danger? 2) Why didn't they happen weapons? 3) How could Khan have survived with those people so many years on a decrepit planet? 4) How could Khan's men just take over a starfleet ship? They are clearly outnumbered and outgunned. 5) How could Khan and his men know how to fly a starfleet ship? Wouldn't they have security measures to use things on the ship? 6) How did Khan have time to go the science station and kill all those people? 7) Why wouldn't the enterprise have its shield up at all times? What if they got shot out of nowhere? 8) When Khan is beaming up the genesis, the Star Trek crew has a good 15 seconds to move that out of the way. Instead, Kirk yells "Khan!" for 15 seconds. 9) What was Khan's plan with the genesis? How would he even know how to use it? Bad Acting-wise: 1) Chekov and that black guy. Especially, the black guy when he is resisting killing Kirk. 2) Khan is hokey a lot of the time. 3) People saying their last words, then dying. 4) Kirk's yelling of "Khan!" was as bad as Darth Vader yelling "No!" in Episode III.

    The Star Trek feature film debut had its fair share of ambition and spectacle, but was a lumbering beast of a film that proved bewildering and somewhat dull. It makes for a decent space opera, but in their wisdom, the filmmakers realized that they needed to spice things up for the inevitable sequel. Even at the expense of kicking Gene Roddenberry - the revered creator of the franchise - to the curb. Thus, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came into fruition. Coming after the classic Trek episode Space Seed, this film brings back Khan Noonien Singh as the story's nemesis, and the whole thing becomes a rocketing thrill ride from then on. Space battles are fairly simple and short, but they are still quite spectacular to watch, especially with the colorful backgrounds of the Mutara Nebula. The pacing is even throughout, and the film boasts some remarkable iconic moments that all audiences can recognize and relate to. The story is appealing; even though there is plenty of action and peril in the movie, it has enough breathing space for quality characterization and theme development. A good chunk of room is left for Kirk contemplating his old age and mortality, and thanks to the parallels of the Genesis torpedo and the film's ultimate solution, strong themes of death and rebirth emerge very subtly. Even without such elements, the characters come off as being well-rounded and enjoyable. The story covers some fascinating concepts, and is well-structured. This film is shot and edited with quality precision. Acting is phenomenal: while it is always a joy to see William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the rest of the crew in action, Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n steals the show as the villain, with a powerful and iconic performance. Writing is great, featuring plenty of great memorable lines. The production has a fine array of solid sets, props, costumes, and special effects (costumes in particular are much improved from the last Trek picture). Music, despite deviating from the classic Trek themes, has a catchy melodic charm of its own. Of this film, I can say this. Of all the Trek films I have known, this still the most...endearing. 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

I keep saying Trek in this film, but when this film is the best I am gonna use the word Trek a lot and if this was the worst one, which it isn't, I would use Trek a lot too. Anyway this is a great film and is a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it. This is the definitive Trek film and one of the Best Science Fiction films of all time.

    Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline that improves immensely on the first Star Trek movie,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,and you can even tell from the acting that the cast was more positive about this script than they were for the first movie.The thing I liked best about this was that it felt more cinematic,like something they couldn't do on the television series,thats the only reason films for TV shows should be made,to have a much larger situation,the first movie just feels like a long episode of Star Trek,but this movie is really what a movie based on a television series needs to be.Fans of the original Star Trek series will not be let down by the second installment. The Enterprise must work together to stop a nemesis of Captain Kirk from using his sons device,the Genesis,which is able to destroy any planet in the galaxy.

    Watching Abrams' latest tepid outing on the big screen inspired me to re-watch the film from which he stole so much material. And it's better by an even vaster margin than I remembered. The thing about TWOK is that it's not without its minor plot-holes or inconsistencies, but it has the energy and compelling, driving core story to make them seem irrelevant. It's not the sumptuous visual feast modern CGI can turn out either... but again, that's to the good, as it also has none of the tacky, moronic excess that so characterizes the CGI era. Its effects are convincing and restrained, doing what they need to do and otherwise keeping out of the story's way. What brings TWOK to the apex of the Trek universe is that it embodies the basic premise Trek was original built around: the premise of telling great stories that *just happened* to take place in an SF setting. One of the finest episodes of the original series was "Balance of Terror," a tense destroyer-versus-sub duel that could have come out of the Pacific Theatre of WW2 but for its SF trappings. TWOK riffed on this and created probably the best starship duel ever put to film, adding the original series' best-ever bad guy to the mix and putting it all together with masterful pacing and momentum. This is the difference that writing makes between a mediocre film and a great one. It was something of a curse, ironically, on the film franchise that they made it all look so deceptively straightforward and simple in TWOK. The Trek films never recovered this magic, never climbed these heights again, because too many subsequent directors -- Abrams now among them -- just didn't get what made the franchise's greatest instalment work so well. If the Next Generation crew ultimately proved the best in the televised medium, the original cast still owns the silver screen on the strength of this film.

    I just saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan for the first time. It had a lot of faulty logic in it. It felt like a bad sixties B-movie. 1) Why didn't Chekov get beamed up as soon as he was in danger? 2) Why didn't they happen weapons? 3) How could Khan have survived with those people so many years on a decrepit planet? 4) How could Khan's men just take over a starfleet ship? They are clearly outnumbered and outgunned. 5) How could Khan and his men know how to fly a starfleet ship? Wouldn't they have security measures to use things on the ship? 6) How did Khan have time to go the science station and kill all those people? 7) Why wouldn't the enterprise have its shield up at all times? What if they got shot out of nowhere? 8) When Khan is beaming up the genesis, the Star Trek crew has a good 15 seconds to move that out of the way. Instead, Kirk yells "Khan!" for 15 seconds. 9) What was Khan's plan with the genesis? How would he even know how to use it? Bad Acting-wise: 1) Chekov and that black guy. Especially, the black guy when he is resisting killing Kirk. 2) Khan is hokey a lot of the time. 3) People saying their last words, then dying. 4) Kirk's yelling of "Khan!" was as bad as Darth Vader yelling "No!" in Episode III.

    The Star Trek feature film debut had its fair share of ambition and spectacle, but was a lumbering beast of a film that proved bewildering and somewhat dull. It makes for a decent space opera, but in their wisdom, the filmmakers realized that they needed to spice things up for the inevitable sequel. Even at the expense of kicking Gene Roddenberry - the revered creator of the franchise - to the curb. Thus, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came into fruition. Coming after the classic Trek episode Space Seed, this film brings back Khan Noonien Singh as the story's nemesis, and the whole thing becomes a rocketing thrill ride from then on. Space battles are fairly simple and short, but they are still quite spectacular to watch, especially with the colorful backgrounds of the Mutara Nebula. The pacing is even throughout, and the film boasts some remarkable iconic moments that all audiences can recognize and relate to. The story is appealing; even though there is plenty of action and peril in the movie, it has enough breathing space for quality characterization and theme development. A good chunk of room is left for Kirk contemplating his old age and mortality, and thanks to the parallels of the Genesis torpedo and the film's ultimate solution, strong themes of death and rebirth emerge very subtly. Even without such elements, the characters come off as being well-rounded and enjoyable. The story covers some fascinating concepts, and is well-structured. This film is shot and edited with quality precision. Acting is phenomenal: while it is always a joy to see William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the rest of the crew in action, Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n steals the show as the villain, with a powerful and iconic performance. Writing is great, featuring plenty of great memorable lines. The production has a fine array of solid sets, props, costumes, and special effects (costumes in particular are much improved from the last Trek picture). Music, despite deviating from the classic Trek themes, has a catchy melodic charm of its own. Of this film, I can say this. Of all the Trek films I have known, this still the most...endearing. 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a terrific Star Trek film as it brings an old nemesis from the series that only made a short appearance and made a big blockbuster film. The film takes the smarter route then the first as they make it into an action-packed adventure film. The enterprise crew has gone their own ways, but when an old threat returns to cause trouble, Kirk assembles his crew to go after his old nemesis, Khan, before he uses the Genesis program that his son built as a weapon. Can Kirk win and what must he sacrifice to stop Khan? This film is such a better film then the first as the first is like one long episode and this has action, adventure, excitement, and a great villain. Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is an excellent villain and the best in the series and one of the best all-time in cinema. He is just a perfect villain. The story is better as the Genesis project (able to make life on deserted land or on a planet), is the most precious thing right now as it could be an incredible thing to change life or a weapon of mass destruction. The ending is a sad one as to stop Khan and save the ship, Spock kills himself and Kirk is heart broken. He is then shot out of the ship and lands on the nearest planet which Genesis just rebuild. This is an excellent movie and a near perfect job. By far the best out of the original and one of the best Star Trek films ever. Me: A-

    I may not be a Star Trek fan, but I usually enjoy watching the movies. Most of them are pretty good while others are very disappointing, so that's why I'm going to continue reviewing them since Star Trek Into Darkness was released starting with this second installment, "The Krath of Khan". I gotta say, out of all the entries of the franchise, this is easily the best Star Trek film I've seen in almost all my life. Seeing as how it's being known for it's memorable quote "KHAN!!!!!!!", there is absolutely no flaws at all and I'm gonna praise this epic film. The story is very compelling and is a lot closer to the spirit of Star Trek than the original film should've been. It also has a sad moment where Spock dies which is an example of tear-jerking. The script is smart and very inventive and the pacing is very good. The cast from the original film delivers a lot of solid performances especially William Shatner, Leonard Nemoy and Ricardo Montalban as Khan, who is downright creepy and frightening for a Star Trek villain. The scenery and visuals are wonderful to see, but the best part is the music score from James Horner, one of my favorite music composers. He has done some great work (including Apollo 13, Braveheart, Avatar, etc.) and his score for this film is no exception. Overall, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a masterpiece and an epic continuation that saved the franchise back at the early 1980s. Recommended to Star Trek fans who grew up and a thumbs up from me!

    I've never been a major Star Trek fan growing up. I watched a few episodes of the original 60s show and even a lot of the Next Generation but I've never gained a mega-interest in the show. The movies on the other hand, I've started to really get into with the J.J Abrams reboot getting me engaged in the franchise. I started to watch all of the original Trek films in order starting with the Motion Picture, which I was incredibly bored by as were a lot of people even Trekkies. The critical failure of the Motion Picture forced creator Gene Roddenberry out of creative control of the franchise and the series was taken in a new direction. With Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, director Nicholas Meyer crafts an adventure that is both cerebral and action-packed, with the film resembling more of the original series. Just like most people, Star Trek II is my favourite in the series and one of my favourite sci- fi films as well. As James T. Kirk's birthday arrives, he is convinced by Dr. McCoy to go back into command over the Enterprise with Spock agreeing. Meanwhile, Chekov, now serving on the U.S.S Reliant, search for a desolate planet to use as a staging ground for testing the Genesis device which can terraform a world and make it habitable. They arrive on one candidate planet named Ceti Alpha V where Chekov and the Reliant's captain are captured by Khan Noonien Singh, who had been marooned on the planet for fifteen years after Kirk had exiled him and his team of genetically engineered supermen there. Khan now vows vengeance on the Admiral for marooning him and causing the death of his wife. He then implants Chekov and the captain of the Reliant with mind control eels, making them susceptible to his will and allowing him command over the Reliant. When Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise embark on a three year training course, they are ambushed by Khan and his team and become embroiled in a ploy involving his demands for the Genesis device. A sequel to the original series episode 'Space Seed', Wrath of Khan features some of the strongest character building moments of the series. The conflict between Kirk and Khan is unique in that the two never meet face-to-face in this film. A lot of their scenes come from the two duelling it out via communication device. A lot of this is brought to life by the efforts of William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban's performances. Kirk is a more fully realized character in this endeavour. In the show, he was portrayed more as cocky womaniser who always saved the day and triumphed in the end. Here, he realizes what it's like to fail or at least win but with a price. He also discovers that he has a son as a result of a fling with an old flame and that has consequences for his well-being. Ricardo Montalban froths at the mouth as Khan, a truly worthy villain to the Trekverse. His revenge-bent monologues have made him a popular villain in science-fiction to quote and has made him one of Star Trek's most formidable foes. The visuals in Wrath of Khan are competent for a film with a limited budget and the costumes are an improvement over the first film's bland grey uniform code. The redness of the film also does a good job of highlighting the grim tone of the film. It's also important to discuss one of the most important elements of the film which is Spock's death. The death of the fan favourite in the franchise came as a shock to the fanbase and has become one of the biggest geek-out moments in film. The death was handled very well especially in the goodbye scene between Spock and Kirk. Even though he returned in the next film, his death was still played out very well and even the following film didn't damage the moment here. Star Trek Into Darkness recently incorporated this scene along with a lot of elements from this picture into it but did it without damaging the source material. Star Trek II is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, Star Trek films. It's mixture of emotion, cerebral integrity, adequate visuals and character development make this a strong entry in the franchise and one of the most significant science-fiction pictures of its time. It made up for the ponderous dull-fest that was the Motion Picture and is still a film that I watch every now and again.

    Firstly, we have to take the release year of this movie into consider, 1982, the year before Star War v released. Although the scenes of star war seems more magnificent than ours here, we can't expect more when we make it compete with one of the Top 10 movies in IMDb. The scenes of this film here are well connected with its plots. Not as tediously long as the debut of Star Trek series, not seem like as crude as which is without editing, and they accurately match the background musics, which make the whole movie more real seen. Furthermore, the story this time is more interesting and logical than the first one of this series. The villain is reasonable being, the story line is clear to follow and the conversation is much more meaningful. The most of the scenes are acted in the Enterprise and other two ships, but it doesn't make the film fail to attract audiences with the intense fights. Finally, the death of Spock really made me mist my eyes, the sacrifice is moving, it is overwhelming when the coffin was sent out to the space. However, the journey of Enterprise is not finished yet, we will look forward.

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan **1/2 (out of 4) 112 mins/ 12 Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Bibi Besch, Kirstie Alley, Ricardo Montalban Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: With his old crew on a training exercise, Admiral Kirk is forced to do battle with his old rival, Khan. JJ's Verdict: On the surface, 'Wrath of Khan' seems the perfect sci-fi film. From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series: Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour. Ricardo Montalban puts in a performance only second in his career to 'The Naked Gun', in terms of sheer entertainment. His character, Khan, is terrifying and ruthless and Montalban adds a brilliant sophistication to his character with his charming Mexican accent. In this film, as a viewer, you get a better sense of the threat to the Enterprise crew. Despite these positives, the films middle section is painfully slow and despite having a fairly simple plot, its ending, however satisfying it may be, is awfully confusing. It is a huge disappointment that the supposed space battle is very tame and that there is no final confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Probably better than its predecessor and clever in parts, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is just an attempt at copying the style that is so loved in George Lucas' 'Star Wars'.

    I wanted to immediately give this film a 10 out of 10 and then I told myself to sit back and actually judge this film. This is the best Star Trek Film in my eyes followed First Contact and by some peoples surprise Into Darkness. Anyway this is one of the Best Science Fiction films ever and I think is actually in my top 10 or 15. It has a great plot and brings back a villain from the Original nods. This one is probably one for either fans or non fans of Star Trek. Khan is by far the best Trek villain and is one of the most memorable film villains in movie history. He had a back story and this really showed watch Trek could be and had one of the greatest endings in history. I keep saying Trek in this film, but when this film is the best I am gonna use the word Trek a lot and if this was the worst one, which it isn't, I would use Trek a lot too. Anyway this is a great film and is a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it. This is the definitive Trek film and one of the Best Science Fiction films of all time.

    I've never been a major Star Trek fan growing up. I watched a few episodes of the original 60s show and even a lot of the Next Generation but I've never gained a mega-interest in the show. The movies on the other hand, I've started to really get into with the J.J Abrams reboot getting me engaged in the franchise. I started to watch all of the original Trek films in order starting with the Motion Picture, which I was incredibly bored by as were a lot of people even Trekkies. The critical failure of the Motion Picture forced creator Gene Roddenberry out of creative control of the franchise and the series was taken in a new direction. With Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, director Nicholas Meyer crafts an adventure that is both cerebral and action-packed, with the film resembling more of the original series. Just like most people, Star Trek II is my favourite in the series and one of my favourite sci- fi films as well. As James T. Kirk's birthday arrives, he is convinced by Dr. McCoy to go back into command over the Enterprise with Spock agreeing. Meanwhile, Chekov, now serving on the U.S.S Reliant, search for a desolate planet to use as a staging ground for testing the Genesis device which can terraform a world and make it habitable. They arrive on one candidate planet named Ceti Alpha V where Chekov and the Reliant's captain are captured by Khan Noonien Singh, who had been marooned on the planet for fifteen years after Kirk had exiled him and his team of genetically engineered supermen there. Khan now vows vengeance on the Admiral for marooning him and causing the death of his wife. He then implants Chekov and the captain of the Reliant with mind control eels, making them susceptible to his will and allowing him command over the Reliant. When Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise embark on a three year training course, they are ambushed by Khan and his team and become embroiled in a ploy involving his demands for the Genesis device. A sequel to the original series episode 'Space Seed', Wrath of Khan features some of the strongest character building moments of the series. The conflict between Kirk and Khan is unique in that the two never meet face-to-face in this film. A lot of their scenes come from the two duelling it out via communication device. A lot of this is brought to life by the efforts of William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban's performances. Kirk is a more fully realized character in this endeavour. In the show, he was portrayed more as cocky womaniser who always saved the day and triumphed in the end. Here, he realizes what it's like to fail or at least win but with a price. He also discovers that he has a son as a result of a fling with an old flame and that has consequences for his well-being. Ricardo Montalban froths at the mouth as Khan, a truly worthy villain to the Trekverse. His revenge-bent monologues have made him a popular villain in science-fiction to quote and has made him one of Star Trek's most formidable foes. The visuals in Wrath of Khan are competent for a film with a limited budget and the costumes are an improvement over the first film's bland grey uniform code. The redness of the film also does a good job of highlighting the grim tone of the film. It's also important to discuss one of the most important elements of the film which is Spock's death. The death of the fan favourite in the franchise came as a shock to the fanbase and has become one of the biggest geek-out moments in film. The death was handled very well especially in the goodbye scene between Spock and Kirk. Even though he returned in the next film, his death was still played out very well and even the following film didn't damage the moment here. Star Trek Into Darkness recently incorporated this scene along with a lot of elements from this picture into it but did it without damaging the source material. Star Trek II is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, Star Trek films. It's mixture of emotion, cerebral integrity, adequate visuals and character development make this a strong entry in the franchise and one of the most significant science-fiction pictures of its time. It made up for the ponderous dull-fest that was the Motion Picture and is still a film that I watch every now and again.

    Firstly, we have to take the release year of this movie into consider, 1982, the year before Star War v released. Although the scenes of star war seems more magnificent than ours here, we can't expect more when we make it compete with one of the Top 10 movies in IMDb. The scenes of this film here are well connected with its plots. Not as tediously long as the debut of Star Trek series, not seem like as crude as which is without editing, and they accurately match the background musics, which make the whole movie more real seen. Furthermore, the story this time is more interesting and logical than the first one of this series. The villain is reasonable being, the story line is clear to follow and the conversation is much more meaningful. The most of the scenes are acted in the Enterprise and other two ships, but it doesn't make the film fail to attract audiences with the intense fights. Finally, the death of Spock really made me mist my eyes, the sacrifice is moving, it is overwhelming when the coffin was sent out to the space. However, the journey of Enterprise is not finished yet, we will look forward.

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan **1/2 (out of 4) 112 mins/ 12 Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Bibi Besch, Kirstie Alley, Ricardo Montalban Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: With his old crew on a training exercise, Admiral Kirk is forced to do battle with his old rival, Khan. JJ's Verdict: On the surface, 'Wrath of Khan' seems the perfect sci-fi film. From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series: Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour. Ricardo Montalban puts in a performance only second in his career to 'The Naked Gun', in terms of sheer entertainment. His character, Khan, is terrifying and ruthless and Montalban adds a brilliant sophistication to his character with his charming Mexican accent. In this film, as a viewer, you get a better sense of the threat to the Enterprise crew. Despite these positives, the films middle section is painfully slow and despite having a fairly simple plot, its ending, however satisfying it may be, is awfully confusing. It is a huge disappointment that the supposed space battle is very tame and that there is no final confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Probably better than its predecessor and clever in parts, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is just an attempt at copying the style that is so loved in George Lucas' 'Star Wars'.

    I wanted to immediately give this film a 10 out of 10 and then I told myself to sit back and actually judge this film. This is the best Star Trek Film in my eyes followed First Contact and by some peoples surprise Into Darkness. Anyway this is one of the Best Science Fiction films ever and I think is actually in my top 10 or 15. It has a great plot and brings back a villain from the Original nods. This one is probably one for either fans or non fans of Star Trek. Khan is by far the best Trek villain and is one of the most memorable film villains in movie history. He had a back story and this really showed watch Trek could be and had one of the greatest endings in history. I keep saying Trek in this film, but when this film is the best I am gonna use the word Trek a lot and if this was the worst one, which it isn't, I would use Trek a lot too. Anyway this is a great film and is a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it. This is the definitive Trek film and one of the Best Science Fiction films of all time.

    Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline that improves immensely on the first Star Trek movie,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,and you can even tell from the acting that the cast was more positive about this script than they were for the first movie.The thing I liked best about this was that it felt more cinematic,like something they couldn't do on the television series,thats the only reason films for TV shows should be made,to have a much larger situation,the first movie just feels like a long episode of Star Trek,but this movie is really what a movie based on a television series needs to be.Fans of the original Star Trek series will not be let down by the second installment. The Enterprise must work together to stop a nemesis of Captain Kirk from using his sons device,the Genesis,which is able to destroy any planet in the galaxy.

    Watching Abrams' latest tepid outing on the big screen inspired me to re-watch the film from which he stole so much material. And it's better by an even vaster margin than I remembered. The thing about TWOK is that it's not without its minor plot-holes or inconsistencies, but it has the energy and compelling, driving core story to make them seem irrelevant. It's not the sumptuous visual feast modern CGI can turn out either... but again, that's to the good, as it also has none of the tacky, moronic excess that so characterizes the CGI era. Its effects are convincing and restrained, doing what they need to do and otherwise keeping out of the story's way. What brings TWOK to the apex of the Trek universe is that it embodies the basic premise Trek was original built around: the premise of telling great stories that *just happened* to take place in an SF setting. One of the finest episodes of the original series was "Balance of Terror," a tense destroyer-versus-sub duel that could have come out of the Pacific Theatre of WW2 but for its SF trappings. TWOK riffed on this and created probably the best starship duel ever put to film, adding the original series' best-ever bad guy to the mix and putting it all together with masterful pacing and momentum. This is the difference that writing makes between a mediocre film and a great one. It was something of a curse, ironically, on the film franchise that they made it all look so deceptively straightforward and simple in TWOK. The Trek films never recovered this magic, never climbed these heights again, because too many subsequent directors -- Abrams now among them -- just didn't get what made the franchise's greatest instalment work so well. If the Next Generation crew ultimately proved the best in the televised medium, the original cast still owns the silver screen on the strength of this film.

    I just saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan for the first time. It had a lot of faulty logic in it. It felt like a bad sixties B-movie. 1) Why didn't Chekov get beamed up as soon as he was in danger? 2) Why didn't they happen weapons? 3) How could Khan have survived with those people so many years on a decrepit planet? 4) How could Khan's men just take over a starfleet ship? They are clearly outnumbered and outgunned. 5) How could Khan and his men know how to fly a starfleet ship? Wouldn't they have security measures to use things on the ship? 6) How did Khan have time to go the science station and kill all those people? 7) Why wouldn't the enterprise have its shield up at all times? What if they got shot out of nowhere? 8) When Khan is beaming up the genesis, the Star Trek crew has a good 15 seconds to move that out of the way. Instead, Kirk yells "Khan!" for 15 seconds. 9) What was Khan's plan with the genesis? How would he even know how to use it? Bad Acting-wise: 1) Chekov and that black guy. Especially, the black guy when he is resisting killing Kirk. 2) Khan is hokey a lot of the time. 3) People saying their last words, then dying. 4) Kirk's yelling of "Khan!" was as bad as Darth Vader yelling "No!" in Episode III.

    The Star Trek feature film debut had its fair share of ambition and spectacle, but was a lumbering beast of a film that proved bewildering and somewhat dull. It makes for a decent space opera, but in their wisdom, the filmmakers realized that they needed to spice things up for the inevitable sequel. Even at the expense of kicking Gene Roddenberry - the revered creator of the franchise - to the curb. Thus, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came into fruition. Coming after the classic Trek episode Space Seed, this film brings back Khan Noonien Singh as the story's nemesis, and the whole thing becomes a rocketing thrill ride from then on. Space battles are fairly simple and short, but they are still quite spectacular to watch, especially with the colorful backgrounds of the Mutara Nebula. The pacing is even throughout, and the film boasts some remarkable iconic moments that all audiences can recognize and relate to. The story is appealing; even though there is plenty of action and peril in the movie, it has enough breathing space for quality characterization and theme development. A good chunk of room is left for Kirk contemplating his old age and mortality, and thanks to the parallels of the Genesis torpedo and the film's ultimate solution, strong themes of death and rebirth emerge very subtly. Even without such elements, the characters come off as being well-rounded and enjoyable. The story covers some fascinating concepts, and is well-structured. This film is shot and edited with quality precision. Acting is phenomenal: while it is always a joy to see William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the rest of the crew in action, Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n steals the show as the villain, with a powerful and iconic performance. Writing is great, featuring plenty of great memorable lines. The production has a fine array of solid sets, props, costumes, and special effects (costumes in particular are much improved from the last Trek picture). Music, despite deviating from the classic Trek themes, has a catchy melodic charm of its own. Of this film, I can say this. Of all the Trek films I have known, this still the most...endearing. 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a terrific Star Trek film as it brings an old nemesis from the series that only made a short appearance and made a big blockbuster film. The film takes the smarter route then the first as they make it into an action-packed adventure film. The enterprise crew has gone their own ways, but when an old threat returns to cause trouble, Kirk assembles his crew to go after his old nemesis, Khan, before he uses the Genesis program that his son built as a weapon. Can Kirk win and what must he sacrifice to stop Khan? This film is such a better film then the first as the first is like one long episode and this has action, adventure, excitement, and a great villain. Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is an excellent villain and the best in the series and one of the best all-time in cinema. He is just a perfect villain. The story is better as the Genesis project (able to make life on deserted land or on a planet), is the most precious thing right now as it could be an incredible thing to change life or a weapon of mass destruction. The ending is a sad one as to stop Khan and save the ship, Spock kills himself and Kirk is heart broken. He is then shot out of the ship and lands on the nearest planet which Genesis just rebuild. This is an excellent movie and a near perfect job. By far the best out of the original and one of the best Star Trek films ever. Me: A-

    I may not be a Star Trek fan, but I usually enjoy watching the movies. Most of them are pretty good while others are very disappointing, so that's why I'm going to continue reviewing them since Star Trek Into Darkness was released starting with this second installment, "The Krath of Khan". I gotta say, out of all the entries of the franchise, this is easily the best Star Trek film I've seen in almost all my life. Seeing as how it's being known for it's memorable quote "KHAN!!!!!!!", there is absolutely no flaws at all and I'm gonna praise this epic film. The story is very compelling and is a lot closer to the spirit of Star Trek than the original film should've been. It also has a sad moment where Spock dies which is an example of tear-jerking. The script is smart and very inventive and the pacing is very good. The cast from the original film delivers a lot of solid performances especially William Shatner, Leonard Nemoy and Ricardo Montalban as Khan, who is downright creepy and frightening for a Star Trek villain. The scenery and visuals are wonderful to see, but the best part is the music score from James Horner, one of my favorite music composers. He has done some great work (including Apollo 13, Braveheart, Avatar, etc.) and his score for this film is no exception. Overall, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a masterpiece and an epic continuation that saved the franchise back at the early 1980s. Recommended to Star Trek fans who grew up and a thumbs up from me!

If the Next Generation crew ultimately proved the best in the televised medium, the original cast still owns the silver screen on the strength of this film.

    I just saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan for the first time. It had a lot of faulty logic in it. It felt like a bad sixties B-movie. 1) Why didn't Chekov get beamed up as soon as he was in danger? 2) Why didn't they happen weapons? 3) How could Khan have survived with those people so many years on a decrepit planet? 4) How could Khan's men just take over a starfleet ship? They are clearly outnumbered and outgunned. 5) How could Khan and his men know how to fly a starfleet ship? Wouldn't they have security measures to use things on the ship? 6) How did Khan have time to go the science station and kill all those people? 7) Why wouldn't the enterprise have its shield up at all times? What if they got shot out of nowhere? 8) When Khan is beaming up the genesis, the Star Trek crew has a good 15 seconds to move that out of the way. Instead, Kirk yells "Khan!" for 15 seconds. 9) What was Khan's plan with the genesis? How would he even know how to use it? Bad Acting-wise: 1) Chekov and that black guy. Especially, the black guy when he is resisting killing Kirk. 2) Khan is hokey a lot of the time. 3) People saying their last words, then dying. 4) Kirk's yelling of "Khan!" was as bad as Darth Vader yelling "No!" in Episode III.

    The Star Trek feature film debut had its fair share of ambition and spectacle, but was a lumbering beast of a film that proved bewildering and somewhat dull. It makes for a decent space opera, but in their wisdom, the filmmakers realized that they needed to spice things up for the inevitable sequel. Even at the expense of kicking Gene Roddenberry - the revered creator of the franchise - to the curb. Thus, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came into fruition. Coming after the classic Trek episode Space Seed, this film brings back Khan Noonien Singh as the story's nemesis, and the whole thing becomes a rocketing thrill ride from then on. Space battles are fairly simple and short, but they are still quite spectacular to watch, especially with the colorful backgrounds of the Mutara Nebula. The pacing is even throughout, and the film boasts some remarkable iconic moments that all audiences can recognize and relate to. The story is appealing; even though there is plenty of action and peril in the movie, it has enough breathing space for quality characterization and theme development. A good chunk of room is left for Kirk contemplating his old age and mortality, and thanks to the parallels of the Genesis torpedo and the film's ultimate solution, strong themes of death and rebirth emerge very subtly. Even without such elements, the characters come off as being well-rounded and enjoyable. The story covers some fascinating concepts, and is well-structured. This film is shot and edited with quality precision. Acting is phenomenal: while it is always a joy to see William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the rest of the crew in action, Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n steals the show as the villain, with a powerful and iconic performance. Writing is great, featuring plenty of great memorable lines. The production has a fine array of solid sets, props, costumes, and special effects (costumes in particular are much improved from the last Trek picture). Music, despite deviating from the classic Trek themes, has a catchy melodic charm of its own. Of this film, I can say this. Of all the Trek films I have known, this still the most...endearing. 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a terrific Star Trek film as it brings an old nemesis from the series that only made a short appearance and made a big blockbuster film. The film takes the smarter route then the first as they make it into an action-packed adventure film. The enterprise crew has gone their own ways, but when an old threat returns to cause trouble, Kirk assembles his crew to go after his old nemesis, Khan, before he uses the Genesis program that his son built as a weapon. Can Kirk win and what must he sacrifice to stop Khan? This film is such a better film then the first as the first is like one long episode and this has action, adventure, excitement, and a great villain. Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is an excellent villain and the best in the series and one of the best all-time in cinema. He is just a perfect villain. The story is better as the Genesis project (able to make life on deserted land or on a planet), is the most precious thing right now as it could be an incredible thing to change life or a weapon of mass destruction. The ending is a sad one as to stop Khan and save the ship, Spock kills himself and Kirk is heart broken. He is then shot out of the ship and lands on the nearest planet which Genesis just rebuild. This is an excellent movie and a near perfect job. By far the best out of the original and one of the best Star Trek films ever. Me: A-

    I may not be a Star Trek fan, but I usually enjoy watching the movies. Most of them are pretty good while others are very disappointing, so that's why I'm going to continue reviewing them since Star Trek Into Darkness was released starting with this second installment, "The Krath of Khan". I gotta say, out of all the entries of the franchise, this is easily the best Star Trek film I've seen in almost all my life. Seeing as how it's being known for it's memorable quote "KHAN!!!!!!!", there is absolutely no flaws at all and I'm gonna praise this epic film. The story is very compelling and is a lot closer to the spirit of Star Trek than the original film should've been. It also has a sad moment where Spock dies which is an example of tear-jerking. The script is smart and very inventive and the pacing is very good. The cast from the original film delivers a lot of solid performances especially William Shatner, Leonard Nemoy and Ricardo Montalban as Khan, who is downright creepy and frightening for a Star Trek villain. The scenery and visuals are wonderful to see, but the best part is the music score from James Horner, one of my favorite music composers. He has done some great work (including Apollo 13, Braveheart, Avatar, etc.) and his score for this film is no exception. Overall, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a masterpiece and an epic continuation that saved the franchise back at the early 1980s. Recommended to Star Trek fans who grew up and a thumbs up from me!

    I've never been a major Star Trek fan growing up. I watched a few episodes of the original 60s show and even a lot of the Next Generation but I've never gained a mega-interest in the show. The movies on the other hand, I've started to really get into with the J.J Abrams reboot getting me engaged in the franchise. I started to watch all of the original Trek films in order starting with the Motion Picture, which I was incredibly bored by as were a lot of people even Trekkies. The critical failure of the Motion Picture forced creator Gene Roddenberry out of creative control of the franchise and the series was taken in a new direction. With Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, director Nicholas Meyer crafts an adventure that is both cerebral and action-packed, with the film resembling more of the original series. Just like most people, Star Trek II is my favourite in the series and one of my favourite sci- fi films as well. As James T. Kirk's birthday arrives, he is convinced by Dr. McCoy to go back into command over the Enterprise with Spock agreeing. Meanwhile, Chekov, now serving on the U.S.S Reliant, search for a desolate planet to use as a staging ground for testing the Genesis device which can terraform a world and make it habitable. They arrive on one candidate planet named Ceti Alpha V where Chekov and the Reliant's captain are captured by Khan Noonien Singh, who had been marooned on the planet for fifteen years after Kirk had exiled him and his team of genetically engineered supermen there. Khan now vows vengeance on the Admiral for marooning him and causing the death of his wife. He then implants Chekov and the captain of the Reliant with mind control eels, making them susceptible to his will and allowing him command over the Reliant. When Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise embark on a three year training course, they are ambushed by Khan and his team and become embroiled in a ploy involving his demands for the Genesis device. A sequel to the original series episode 'Space Seed', Wrath of Khan features some of the strongest character building moments of the series. The conflict between Kirk and Khan is unique in that the two never meet face-to-face in this film. A lot of their scenes come from the two duelling it out via communication device. A lot of this is brought to life by the efforts of William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban's performances. Kirk is a more fully realized character in this endeavour. In the show, he was portrayed more as cocky womaniser who always saved the day and triumphed in the end. Here, he realizes what it's like to fail or at least win but with a price. He also discovers that he has a son as a result of a fling with an old flame and that has consequences for his well-being. Ricardo Montalban froths at the mouth as Khan, a truly worthy villain to the Trekverse. His revenge-bent monologues have made him a popular villain in science-fiction to quote and has made him one of Star Trek's most formidable foes. The visuals in Wrath of Khan are competent for a film with a limited budget and the costumes are an improvement over the first film's bland grey uniform code. The redness of the film also does a good job of highlighting the grim tone of the film. It's also important to discuss one of the most important elements of the film which is Spock's death. The death of the fan favourite in the franchise came as a shock to the fanbase and has become one of the biggest geek-out moments in film. The death was handled very well especially in the goodbye scene between Spock and Kirk. Even though he returned in the next film, his death was still played out very well and even the following film didn't damage the moment here. Star Trek Into Darkness recently incorporated this scene along with a lot of elements from this picture into it but did it without damaging the source material. Star Trek II is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, Star Trek films. It's mixture of emotion, cerebral integrity, adequate visuals and character development make this a strong entry in the franchise and one of the most significant science-fiction pictures of its time. It made up for the ponderous dull-fest that was the Motion Picture and is still a film that I watch every now and again.

    Firstly, we have to take the release year of this movie into consider, 1982, the year before Star War v released. Although the scenes of star war seems more magnificent than ours here, we can't expect more when we make it compete with one of the Top 10 movies in IMDb. The scenes of this film here are well connected with its plots. Not as tediously long as the debut of Star Trek series, not seem like as crude as which is without editing, and they accurately match the background musics, which make the whole movie more real seen. Furthermore, the story this time is more interesting and logical than the first one of this series. The villain is reasonable being, the story line is clear to follow and the conversation is much more meaningful. The most of the scenes are acted in the Enterprise and other two ships, but it doesn't make the film fail to attract audiences with the intense fights. Finally, the death of Spock really made me mist my eyes, the sacrifice is moving, it is overwhelming when the coffin was sent out to the space. However, the journey of Enterprise is not finished yet, we will look forward.

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan **1/2 (out of 4) 112 mins/ 12 Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Bibi Besch, Kirstie Alley, Ricardo Montalban Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: With his old crew on a training exercise, Admiral Kirk is forced to do battle with his old rival, Khan. JJ's Verdict: On the surface, 'Wrath of Khan' seems the perfect sci-fi film. From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series: Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour. Ricardo Montalban puts in a performance only second in his career to 'The Naked Gun', in terms of sheer entertainment. His character, Khan, is terrifying and ruthless and Montalban adds a brilliant sophistication to his character with his charming Mexican accent. In this film, as a viewer, you get a better sense of the threat to the Enterprise crew. Despite these positives, the films middle section is painfully slow and despite having a fairly simple plot, its ending, however satisfying it may be, is awfully confusing. It is a huge disappointment that the supposed space battle is very tame and that there is no final confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Probably better than its predecessor and clever in parts, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is just an attempt at copying the style that is so loved in George Lucas' 'Star Wars'.

    I wanted to immediately give this film a 10 out of 10 and then I told myself to sit back and actually judge this film. This is the best Star Trek Film in my eyes followed First Contact and by some peoples surprise Into Darkness. Anyway this is one of the Best Science Fiction films ever and I think is actually in my top 10 or 15. It has a great plot and brings back a villain from the Original nods. This one is probably one for either fans or non fans of Star Trek. Khan is by far the best Trek villain and is one of the most memorable film villains in movie history. He had a back story and this really showed watch Trek could be and had one of the greatest endings in history. I keep saying Trek in this film, but when this film is the best I am gonna use the word Trek a lot and if this was the worst one, which it isn't, I would use Trek a lot too. Anyway this is a great film and is a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it. This is the definitive Trek film and one of the Best Science Fiction films of all time.

    Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline that improves immensely on the first Star Trek movie,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,and you can even tell from the acting that the cast was more positive about this script than they were for the first movie.The thing I liked best about this was that it felt more cinematic,like something they couldn't do on the television series,thats the only reason films for TV shows should be made,to have a much larger situation,the first movie just feels like a long episode of Star Trek,but this movie is really what a movie based on a television series needs to be.Fans of the original Star Trek series will not be let down by the second installment. The Enterprise must work together to stop a nemesis of Captain Kirk from using his sons device,the Genesis,which is able to destroy any planet in the galaxy.

    Watching Abrams' latest tepid outing on the big screen inspired me to re-watch the film from which he stole so much material. And it's better by an even vaster margin than I remembered. The thing about TWOK is that it's not without its minor plot-holes or inconsistencies, but it has the energy and compelling, driving core story to make them seem irrelevant. It's not the sumptuous visual feast modern CGI can turn out either... but again, that's to the good, as it also has none of the tacky, moronic excess that so characterizes the CGI era. Its effects are convincing and restrained, doing what they need to do and otherwise keeping out of the story's way. What brings TWOK to the apex of the Trek universe is that it embodies the basic premise Trek was original built around: the premise of telling great stories that *just happened* to take place in an SF setting. One of the finest episodes of the original series was "Balance of Terror," a tense destroyer-versus-sub duel that could have come out of the Pacific Theatre of WW2 but for its SF trappings. TWOK riffed on this and created probably the best starship duel ever put to film, adding the original series' best-ever bad guy to the mix and putting it all together with masterful pacing and momentum. This is the difference that writing makes between a mediocre film and a great one. It was something of a curse, ironically, on the film franchise that they made it all look so deceptively straightforward and simple in TWOK. The Trek films never recovered this magic, never climbed these heights again, because too many subsequent directors -- Abrams now among them -- just didn't get what made the franchise's greatest instalment work so well. If the Next Generation crew ultimately proved the best in the televised medium, the original cast still owns the silver screen on the strength of this film.

Star Trek Into Darkness recently incorporated this scene along with a lot of elements from this picture into it but did it without damaging the source material. Star Trek II is one of my favourite, if not my favourite, Star Trek films. It's mixture of emotion, cerebral integrity, adequate visuals and character development make this a strong entry in the franchise and one of the most significant science-fiction pictures of its time. It made up for the ponderous dull-fest that was the Motion Picture and is still a film that I watch every now and again.

    Firstly, we have to take the release year of this movie into consider, 1982, the year before Star War v released. Although the scenes of star war seems more magnificent than ours here, we can't expect more when we make it compete with one of the Top 10 movies in IMDb. The scenes of this film here are well connected with its plots. Not as tediously long as the debut of Star Trek series, not seem like as crude as which is without editing, and they accurately match the background musics, which make the whole movie more real seen. Furthermore, the story this time is more interesting and logical than the first one of this series. The villain is reasonable being, the story line is clear to follow and the conversation is much more meaningful. The most of the scenes are acted in the Enterprise and other two ships, but it doesn't make the film fail to attract audiences with the intense fights. Finally, the death of Spock really made me mist my eyes, the sacrifice is moving, it is overwhelming when the coffin was sent out to the space. However, the journey of Enterprise is not finished yet, we will look forward.

    Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan **1/2 (out of 4) 112 mins/ 12 Cast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Bibi Besch, Kirstie Alley, Ricardo Montalban Director: Nicholas Meyer Plot: With his old crew on a training exercise, Admiral Kirk is forced to do battle with his old rival, Khan. JJ's Verdict: On the surface, 'Wrath of Khan' seems the perfect sci-fi film. From a cool film opening, to its humour, likable protagonists, good special effects, a brilliant villain and an epic score. However, all of these just seem an imitation of a far superior film series: Star Wars. The first entry in the Star Trek series, although had its faults, at least had its own style unlike this. This doesn't mean it isn't a bad film, however. Yet again the entire crew put in commanding performances and William's Shatner portrayal of an ageing Kirk is probably his best. The film also has better sound and visual effects and ups the suspense, most notable in the film's first and last half an hour. Ricardo Montalban puts in a performance only second in his career to 'The Naked Gun', in terms of sheer entertainment. His character, Khan, is terrifying and ruthless and Montalban adds a brilliant sophistication to his character with his charming Mexican accent. In this film, as a viewer, you get a better sense of the threat to the Enterprise crew. Despite these positives, the films middle section is painfully slow and despite having a fairly simple plot, its ending, however satisfying it may be, is awfully confusing. It is a huge disappointment that the supposed space battle is very tame and that there is no final confrontation between Kirk and Khan. Probably better than its predecessor and clever in parts, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is just an attempt at copying the style that is so loved in George Lucas' 'Star Wars'.

    I wanted to immediately give this film a 10 out of 10 and then I told myself to sit back and actually judge this film. This is the best Star Trek Film in my eyes followed First Contact and by some peoples surprise Into Darkness. Anyway this is one of the Best Science Fiction films ever and I think is actually in my top 10 or 15. It has a great plot and brings back a villain from the Original nods. This one is probably one for either fans or non fans of Star Trek. Khan is by far the best Trek villain and is one of the most memorable film villains in movie history. He had a back story and this really showed watch Trek could be and had one of the greatest endings in history. I keep saying Trek in this film, but when this film is the best I am gonna use the word Trek a lot and if this was the worst one, which it isn't, I would use Trek a lot too. Anyway this is a great film and is a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it. This is the definitive Trek film and one of the Best Science Fiction films of all time.

    Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan is a great movie with a really well thought out storyline that improves immensely on the first Star Trek movie,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,and you can even tell from the acting that the cast was more positive about this script than they were for the first movie.The thing I liked best about this was that it felt more cinematic,like something they couldn't do on the television series,thats the only reason films for TV shows should be made,to have a much larger situation,the first movie just feels like a long episode of Star Trek,but this movie is really what a movie based on a television series needs to be.Fans of the original Star Trek series will not be let down by the second installment. The Enterprise must work together to stop a nemesis of Captain Kirk from using his sons device,the Genesis,which is able to destroy any planet in the galaxy.

    Watching Abrams' latest tepid outing on the big screen inspired me to re-watch the film from which he stole so much material. And it's better by an even vaster margin than I remembered. The thing about TWOK is that it's not without its minor plot-holes or inconsistencies, but it has the energy and compelling, driving core story to make them seem irrelevant. It's not the sumptuous visual feast modern CGI can turn out either... but again, that's to the good, as it also has none of the tacky, moronic excess that so characterizes the CGI era. Its effects are convincing and restrained, doing what they need to do and otherwise keeping out of the story's way. What brings TWOK to the apex of the Trek universe is that it embodies the basic premise Trek was original built around: the premise of telling great stories that *just happened* to take place in an SF setting. One of the finest episodes of the original series was "Balance of Terror," a tense destroyer-versus-sub duel that could have come out of the Pacific Theatre of WW2 but for its SF trappings. TWOK riffed on this and created probably the best starship duel ever put to film, adding the original series' best-ever bad guy to the mix and putting it all together with masterful pacing and momentum. This is the difference that writing makes between a mediocre film and a great one. It was something of a curse, ironically, on the film franchise that they made it all look so deceptively straightforward and simple in TWOK. The Trek films never recovered this magic, never climbed these heights again, because too many subsequent directors -- Abrams now among them -- just didn't get what made the franchise's greatest instalment work so well. If the Next Generation crew ultimately proved the best in the televised medium, the original cast still owns the silver screen on the strength of this film.

    I just saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan for the first time. It had a lot of faulty logic in it. It felt like a bad sixties B-movie. 1) Why didn't Chekov get beamed up as soon as he was in danger? 2) Why didn't they happen weapons? 3) How could Khan have survived with those people so many years on a decrepit planet? 4) How could Khan's men just take over a starfleet ship? They are clearly outnumbered and outgunned. 5) How could Khan and his men know how to fly a starfleet ship? Wouldn't they have security measures to use things on the ship? 6) How did Khan have time to go the science station and kill all those people? 7) Why wouldn't the enterprise have its shield up at all times? What if they got shot out of nowhere? 8) When Khan is beaming up the genesis, the Star Trek crew has a good 15 seconds to move that out of the way. Instead, Kirk yells "Khan!" for 15 seconds. 9) What was Khan's plan with the genesis? How would he even know how to use it? Bad Acting-wise: 1) Chekov and that black guy. Especially, the black guy when he is resisting killing Kirk. 2) Khan is hokey a lot of the time. 3) People saying their last words, then dying. 4) Kirk's yelling of "Khan!" was as bad as Darth Vader yelling "No!" in Episode III.

    The Star Trek feature film debut had its fair share of ambition and spectacle, but was a lumbering beast of a film that proved bewildering and somewhat dull. It makes for a decent space opera, but in their wisdom, the filmmakers realized that they needed to spice things up for the inevitable sequel. Even at the expense of kicking Gene Roddenberry - the revered creator of the franchise - to the curb. Thus, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came into fruition. Coming after the classic Trek episode Space Seed, this film brings back Khan Noonien Singh as the story's nemesis, and the whole thing becomes a rocketing thrill ride from then on. Space battles are fairly simple and short, but they are still quite spectacular to watch, especially with the colorful backgrounds of the Mutara Nebula. The pacing is even throughout, and the film boasts some remarkable iconic moments that all audiences can recognize and relate to. The story is appealing; even though there is plenty of action and peril in the movie, it has enough breathing space for quality characterization and theme development. A good chunk of room is left for Kirk contemplating his old age and mortality, and thanks to the parallels of the Genesis torpedo and the film's ultimate solution, strong themes of death and rebirth emerge very subtly. Even without such elements, the characters come off as being well-rounded and enjoyable. The story covers some fascinating concepts, and is well-structured. This film is shot and edited with quality precision. Acting is phenomenal: while it is always a joy to see William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the rest of the crew in action, Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n steals the show as the villain, with a powerful and iconic performance. Writing is great, featuring plenty of great memorable lines. The production has a fine array of solid sets, props, costumes, and special effects (costumes in particular are much improved from the last Trek picture). Music, despite deviating from the classic Trek themes, has a catchy melodic charm of its own. Of this film, I can say this. Of all the Trek films I have known, this still the most...endearing. 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)
