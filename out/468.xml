    It's about the guy who once had a dream, but he was always listening others about how he cannot reach it. His name is Rudy and he's big fan of Notre dame football team, his childhood dream is to play for them or at least to made a debut for them. Whole his family was watching them and they were big supporters of them, every Sunday they were in front of television watching them. After graduation of high school, he couldn't go to Notre dame college since he had bad grades so his dream just fall in river. He decided to start working family job, in steel mill. After death of his best friend, Pete, he decided to get back to college, but yet again his grades were too low for this one, so he had to go to other one called Holy Cross College. After some years in Holy Cross College, he got applied to Norte Dame and his dream got real. He was good student, he was getting better and better grades, playing for football team and one pretty impressive fact is he never missed any of trainings in those 2 years of playing. But, he wasn't good enough for those guys due his psychical problems. His teammates were just too strong for him, but Rudy had a faith, he had a dream that he's going to reach one day and hearth. His teammates noticed it and they respected that. They were impressed of how he can go so hard even though he got refused many times. And before their last game, they decided to help him reaching his dream by talking on their trainer to put him in first team. Trainer wasn't alright with that decision but he made it, he put him as sub. He made his debut match against Georgia tech, whole stadium was screaming his name. Rudy reached his dream, his parents, brothers, friend were proud of him. If you like inspirations movies this one is perfect for you, for binging up your motivation. I must mention that this movie is based on true story.

    The most amazing thing about this movie is that I didn't slip into a long term comma before the end. In fact, the other night I painted the living room... and I have to say, watching the paint dry was more entertaining than this film. The entire script is non eventful. The acting is shallow and one dimensional. I think a cardboard cutout would have been more convincing in the lead role. And the ending is totally predictable (if you can make it to the end without falling asleep). It could have been a great story, but somehow they've managed to turn a potentially inspiring story into something more boring than watching a Bob Ross show in slow motion. Icing on the cake, is the grandiose sound track. It just doesn't match what your viewing. There's nothing happening and the overly orchestrated background music sounds as if something incredible is going on. When in fact, nothing vital to the "underdog defeats the world" plot is going on. And sad thing is, the underdog is somebody you don't really care about, or can relate to and by the end of the film you wish he would just go away.

    I guess it is just assumed that every Notre Dame fan likes the movie Rudy. I don't, so I guess that makes me an anomaly. Now that I've got that out of the way, this movie does a good job with playing the underdog card. The acting is good, and it does not detract in almost any of the scenes. An exception may be some of the football player actors. Slightly clunky lines and delivery there, but nothing that derails the narrative. Also, the cinematography is great; this is a very beautiful looking film. I also think the movie did a good job of capturing the feeling of the University of Notre Dame on football Saturday. So why do I not like this movie? The based on a true story claim. Look, I get that Hollywood needs to take certain liberties with the facts to make it a better product, but this movie is an instance where it just goes too far. I don't actually know much about Rudy's personal life, I am referring more to the actual finale of the movie. There are plenty of accounts of the inaccuracies of the ending game and buildup, so I won't go into it. And while I don't like some of the liberties taken with facts, I HATE the depiction of Dan Devine in this movie. This movie didn't need to have an antagonist. It is incredibly lazy how they wrote him to be a stereotypical jerk who won't let the protagonist succeed at any cost. Devine was nice guy in real life who became a convenient scapegoat for this smaltzy movie. That is absolutely TERRIBLE writing.

    OK, a few scenes I liked: the scene with the walk-on tryouts where the assistant coach tells them they can expect to get pounded on by the first teamers, and nobody cares whether they get hurt or not. Also during Rudy's senior year, the background music and late autumn scenes were both breathtaking, yet with the realization that time was running out on Rudy's last season and his last chance to play. Finally, it was neat to see how the other players gradually came to appreciate Rudy for his stick-to-itiveness, to the point where each of the starters asked Coach Divine to let Rudy dress in their place. Only problem with that: in real life it never happened that way. Coach Divine had every intention to let Rudy play and was rather angry that the movie portrayed him otherwise. Still though, it added to the drama. My favorite scene of all is when Fortune (Charles Dutton)encourages Rudy to go to his final practice because if he doesn't, he'll regret it for the rest of his life, "letting them get the best of you". My only criticism is with the excessive profanity coming from Rudy's friend at Holy Cross. I try not to let a few bad words bother me, but when it's excessive and really adds nothing whatsoever to the story. I mean, really, how would this movie have been any worse without the friend's repeated use of "G..D.."? Without those scenes, this movie is a 10. Overall, very inspiring, even if you're not a football fan.

    I just caught this on Sunday afternoon TV, I live down under, born and bred in Holland, and have no real interest in Grid Iron, hey I only know the real Football (soccer), but man I really like this great story. It was great to watch a film that had no sex drugs or rock and roll, just a great story about a small bloke trying his best to prove every one wrong, that size does not matter! I myself am 6'4' 250 pounds, and grew another foot in height on the inside, just a great simple direct to the point film about courage and inner strength! 8 out of 10 for this most see good feel film

    3.5/5 This movie is for all those people who constantly hear that they are not fit or good enough to do something, that they are inadequate. Rudy is small in stature. So his father and his brothers tell him that he cannot achieve his goal of playing football for the Notre Dame which is what he dreams about all the time. His grades are down the drain, so he cannot apply to that university as a student. The movie is the true story of what he does to prove everyone wrong and seize the day. This is a "underdog takes on the world and wins" movie in the league of the far widely known Rocky. But this is one of the better sports movies out there and if you haven't seen it, you should. And don't miss the blink and miss act by Vince Vaughan and John Favreau (the director of Iron Man 1 and 2) as a desperate-for-girls guy who teaches Rudy. Thank you Gaurav Mehta for another splendid recommendation.

    Rudy is a story of the underdog who rises from modest beginnings into a brave, admirable character. Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors. Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted. Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream. In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance. The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment. Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clich&eacute;s monitor the area. So why is Rudy a "good" film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself. I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones. Starring: Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by: David Anspaugh.

    This is a movie that I could watch 100 times and never once get tired of it, it's such a great David vs. Goliath movie. Rudy was a small guy who everyone told you're never going to play for Notre Dame and for good reason, he was 5'9" and weighed next to nothing. He had to fight just to get into Notre Dame as a student by going to Holy Cross for 2 years. Then once he got to ND he tried out for the football team as a walkon. With his absolute never giving up on any of the plays they let him participate in practice as a member of the scout team. But even with that it looked like he would never actually make it into a game. Rudy got coach Ara Parseghian to promise to let him suit up for a game for 1 game during his senior year. But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy. Rudy had won himself over to the rest of the team and the rest of the team threatened to walk out if Rudy didn't get a chance to suit up for a game so Devine finally relented.

    A young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this sports drama entitled,Rudy.This is a film that gives an account of the life of Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh. Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6" and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, "Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!" After "walking on" as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or "scout") squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a "Rudy!" chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates. The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life.

    I saw Rudy on a sunny morning as I had nothing better to do. This movie is so much more than just a kid running behind a football. It is so much more. You start off seeing this kid who is a 5 footer and does not even weigh a 150 pounds who has a larger than life dream. This movie makes you believe that if you do have a dream and you want it badly enough and if you are willing to work for it hard enough there will come along unseen angels who will help you fulfill it. It might be the groundsman(Fortune), D-Bob or all the players on the Norte Dame football team, there will be people who will pull you through thick and thin. The performance by Sean Austin is moving. He portrays the character of Rudy with such ease that you will begin to believe that this is how the real Rudy Ruettiger would have been. The direction and screenplay are of top notch quality. If you do truly connect to the movie the last seconds of the game when Rudy comes on the pitch and makes his tackle will indeed move you to tears. He does deserve to be carried off the field. For an excellently well made movie with one of the strongest characters I've seen on screen and the sheer heart displayed by that young man I give this movie a 10/10.

    Rudy is a story of the underdog who rises from modest beginnings into a brave, admirable character. Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors. Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted. Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream. In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance. The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment. Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clich&eacute;s monitor the area. So why is Rudy a "good" film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself. I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones. Starring: Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by: David Anspaugh.

    This is a movie that I could watch 100 times and never once get tired of it, it's such a great David vs. Goliath movie. Rudy was a small guy who everyone told you're never going to play for Notre Dame and for good reason, he was 5'9" and weighed next to nothing. He had to fight just to get into Notre Dame as a student by going to Holy Cross for 2 years. Then once he got to ND he tried out for the football team as a walkon. With his absolute never giving up on any of the plays they let him participate in practice as a member of the scout team. But even with that it looked like he would never actually make it into a game. Rudy got coach Ara Parseghian to promise to let him suit up for a game for 1 game during his senior year. But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy. Rudy had won himself over to the rest of the team and the rest of the team threatened to walk out if Rudy didn't get a chance to suit up for a game so Devine finally relented.

    A young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this sports drama entitled,Rudy.This is a film that gives an account of the life of Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh. Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6" and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, "Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!" After "walking on" as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or "scout") squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a "Rudy!" chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates. The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life.

    I saw Rudy on a sunny morning as I had nothing better to do. This movie is so much more than just a kid running behind a football. It is so much more. You start off seeing this kid who is a 5 footer and does not even weigh a 150 pounds who has a larger than life dream. This movie makes you believe that if you do have a dream and you want it badly enough and if you are willing to work for it hard enough there will come along unseen angels who will help you fulfill it. It might be the groundsman(Fortune), D-Bob or all the players on the Norte Dame football team, there will be people who will pull you through thick and thin. The performance by Sean Austin is moving. He portrays the character of Rudy with such ease that you will begin to believe that this is how the real Rudy Ruettiger would have been. The direction and screenplay are of top notch quality. If you do truly connect to the movie the last seconds of the game when Rudy comes on the pitch and makes his tackle will indeed move you to tears. He does deserve to be carried off the field. For an excellently well made movie with one of the strongest characters I've seen on screen and the sheer heart displayed by that young man I give this movie a 10/10.

    It's about the guy who once had a dream, but he was always listening others about how he cannot reach it. His name is Rudy and he's big fan of Notre dame football team, his childhood dream is to play for them or at least to made a debut for them. Whole his family was watching them and they were big supporters of them, every Sunday they were in front of television watching them. After graduation of high school, he couldn't go to Notre dame college since he had bad grades so his dream just fall in river. He decided to start working family job, in steel mill. After death of his best friend, Pete, he decided to get back to college, but yet again his grades were too low for this one, so he had to go to other one called Holy Cross College. After some years in Holy Cross College, he got applied to Norte Dame and his dream got real. He was good student, he was getting better and better grades, playing for football team and one pretty impressive fact is he never missed any of trainings in those 2 years of playing. But, he wasn't good enough for those guys due his psychical problems. His teammates were just too strong for him, but Rudy had a faith, he had a dream that he's going to reach one day and hearth. His teammates noticed it and they respected that. They were impressed of how he can go so hard even though he got refused many times. And before their last game, they decided to help him reaching his dream by talking on their trainer to put him in first team. Trainer wasn't alright with that decision but he made it, he put him as sub. He made his debut match against Georgia tech, whole stadium was screaming his name. Rudy reached his dream, his parents, brothers, friend were proud of him. If you like inspirations movies this one is perfect for you, for binging up your motivation. I must mention that this movie is based on true story.

    The most amazing thing about this movie is that I didn't slip into a long term comma before the end. In fact, the other night I painted the living room... and I have to say, watching the paint dry was more entertaining than this film. The entire script is non eventful. The acting is shallow and one dimensional. I think a cardboard cutout would have been more convincing in the lead role. And the ending is totally predictable (if you can make it to the end without falling asleep). It could have been a great story, but somehow they've managed to turn a potentially inspiring story into something more boring than watching a Bob Ross show in slow motion. Icing on the cake, is the grandiose sound track. It just doesn't match what your viewing. There's nothing happening and the overly orchestrated background music sounds as if something incredible is going on. When in fact, nothing vital to the "underdog defeats the world" plot is going on. And sad thing is, the underdog is somebody you don't really care about, or can relate to and by the end of the film you wish he would just go away.

    I guess it is just assumed that every Notre Dame fan likes the movie Rudy. I don't, so I guess that makes me an anomaly. Now that I've got that out of the way, this movie does a good job with playing the underdog card. The acting is good, and it does not detract in almost any of the scenes. An exception may be some of the football player actors. Slightly clunky lines and delivery there, but nothing that derails the narrative. Also, the cinematography is great; this is a very beautiful looking film. I also think the movie did a good job of capturing the feeling of the University of Notre Dame on football Saturday. So why do I not like this movie? The based on a true story claim. Look, I get that Hollywood needs to take certain liberties with the facts to make it a better product, but this movie is an instance where it just goes too far. I don't actually know much about Rudy's personal life, I am referring more to the actual finale of the movie. There are plenty of accounts of the inaccuracies of the ending game and buildup, so I won't go into it. And while I don't like some of the liberties taken with facts, I HATE the depiction of Dan Devine in this movie. This movie didn't need to have an antagonist. It is incredibly lazy how they wrote him to be a stereotypical jerk who won't let the protagonist succeed at any cost. Devine was nice guy in real life who became a convenient scapegoat for this smaltzy movie. That is absolutely TERRIBLE writing.

    OK, a few scenes I liked: the scene with the walk-on tryouts where the assistant coach tells them they can expect to get pounded on by the first teamers, and nobody cares whether they get hurt or not. Also during Rudy's senior year, the background music and late autumn scenes were both breathtaking, yet with the realization that time was running out on Rudy's last season and his last chance to play. Finally, it was neat to see how the other players gradually came to appreciate Rudy for his stick-to-itiveness, to the point where each of the starters asked Coach Divine to let Rudy dress in their place. Only problem with that: in real life it never happened that way. Coach Divine had every intention to let Rudy play and was rather angry that the movie portrayed him otherwise. Still though, it added to the drama. My favorite scene of all is when Fortune (Charles Dutton)encourages Rudy to go to his final practice because if he doesn't, he'll regret it for the rest of his life, "letting them get the best of you". My only criticism is with the excessive profanity coming from Rudy's friend at Holy Cross. I try not to let a few bad words bother me, but when it's excessive and really adds nothing whatsoever to the story. I mean, really, how would this movie have been any worse without the friend's repeated use of "G..D.."? Without those scenes, this movie is a 10. Overall, very inspiring, even if you're not a football fan.

    I just caught this on Sunday afternoon TV, I live down under, born and bred in Holland, and have no real interest in Grid Iron, hey I only know the real Football (soccer), but man I really like this great story. It was great to watch a film that had no sex drugs or rock and roll, just a great story about a small bloke trying his best to prove every one wrong, that size does not matter! I myself am 6'4' 250 pounds, and grew another foot in height on the inside, just a great simple direct to the point film about courage and inner strength! 8 out of 10 for this most see good feel film

    3.5/5 This movie is for all those people who constantly hear that they are not fit or good enough to do something, that they are inadequate. Rudy is small in stature. So his father and his brothers tell him that he cannot achieve his goal of playing football for the Notre Dame which is what he dreams about all the time. His grades are down the drain, so he cannot apply to that university as a student. The movie is the true story of what he does to prove everyone wrong and seize the day. This is a "underdog takes on the world and wins" movie in the league of the far widely known Rocky. But this is one of the better sports movies out there and if you haven't seen it, you should. And don't miss the blink and miss act by Vince Vaughan and John Favreau (the director of Iron Man 1 and 2) as a desperate-for-girls guy who teaches Rudy. Thank you Gaurav Mehta for another splendid recommendation.

His teammates noticed it and they respected that. They were impressed of how he can go so hard even though he got refused many times. And before their last game, they decided to help him reaching his dream by talking on their trainer to put him in first team. Trainer wasn't alright with that decision but he made it, he put him as sub. He made his debut match against Georgia tech, whole stadium was screaming his name. Rudy reached his dream, his parents, brothers, friend were proud of him. If you like inspirations movies this one is perfect for you, for binging up your motivation. I must mention that this movie is based on true story.

    The most amazing thing about this movie is that I didn't slip into a long term comma before the end. In fact, the other night I painted the living room... and I have to say, watching the paint dry was more entertaining than this film. The entire script is non eventful. The acting is shallow and one dimensional. I think a cardboard cutout would have been more convincing in the lead role. And the ending is totally predictable (if you can make it to the end without falling asleep). It could have been a great story, but somehow they've managed to turn a potentially inspiring story into something more boring than watching a Bob Ross show in slow motion. Icing on the cake, is the grandiose sound track. It just doesn't match what your viewing. There's nothing happening and the overly orchestrated background music sounds as if something incredible is going on. When in fact, nothing vital to the "underdog defeats the world" plot is going on. And sad thing is, the underdog is somebody you don't really care about, or can relate to and by the end of the film you wish he would just go away.

    I guess it is just assumed that every Notre Dame fan likes the movie Rudy. I don't, so I guess that makes me an anomaly. Now that I've got that out of the way, this movie does a good job with playing the underdog card. The acting is good, and it does not detract in almost any of the scenes. An exception may be some of the football player actors. Slightly clunky lines and delivery there, but nothing that derails the narrative. Also, the cinematography is great; this is a very beautiful looking film. I also think the movie did a good job of capturing the feeling of the University of Notre Dame on football Saturday. So why do I not like this movie? The based on a true story claim. Look, I get that Hollywood needs to take certain liberties with the facts to make it a better product, but this movie is an instance where it just goes too far. I don't actually know much about Rudy's personal life, I am referring more to the actual finale of the movie. There are plenty of accounts of the inaccuracies of the ending game and buildup, so I won't go into it. And while I don't like some of the liberties taken with facts, I HATE the depiction of Dan Devine in this movie. This movie didn't need to have an antagonist. It is incredibly lazy how they wrote him to be a stereotypical jerk who won't let the protagonist succeed at any cost. Devine was nice guy in real life who became a convenient scapegoat for this smaltzy movie. That is absolutely TERRIBLE writing.

    OK, a few scenes I liked: the scene with the walk-on tryouts where the assistant coach tells them they can expect to get pounded on by the first teamers, and nobody cares whether they get hurt or not. Also during Rudy's senior year, the background music and late autumn scenes were both breathtaking, yet with the realization that time was running out on Rudy's last season and his last chance to play. Finally, it was neat to see how the other players gradually came to appreciate Rudy for his stick-to-itiveness, to the point where each of the starters asked Coach Divine to let Rudy dress in their place. Only problem with that: in real life it never happened that way. Coach Divine had every intention to let Rudy play and was rather angry that the movie portrayed him otherwise. Still though, it added to the drama. My favorite scene of all is when Fortune (Charles Dutton)encourages Rudy to go to his final practice because if he doesn't, he'll regret it for the rest of his life, "letting them get the best of you". My only criticism is with the excessive profanity coming from Rudy's friend at Holy Cross. I try not to let a few bad words bother me, but when it's excessive and really adds nothing whatsoever to the story. I mean, really, how would this movie have been any worse without the friend's repeated use of "G..D.."? Without those scenes, this movie is a 10. Overall, very inspiring, even if you're not a football fan.

    I just caught this on Sunday afternoon TV, I live down under, born and bred in Holland, and have no real interest in Grid Iron, hey I only know the real Football (soccer), but man I really like this great story. It was great to watch a film that had no sex drugs or rock and roll, just a great story about a small bloke trying his best to prove every one wrong, that size does not matter! I myself am 6'4' 250 pounds, and grew another foot in height on the inside, just a great simple direct to the point film about courage and inner strength! 8 out of 10 for this most see good feel film

    3.5/5 This movie is for all those people who constantly hear that they are not fit or good enough to do something, that they are inadequate. Rudy is small in stature. So his father and his brothers tell him that he cannot achieve his goal of playing football for the Notre Dame which is what he dreams about all the time. His grades are down the drain, so he cannot apply to that university as a student. The movie is the true story of what he does to prove everyone wrong and seize the day. This is a "underdog takes on the world and wins" movie in the league of the far widely known Rocky. But this is one of the better sports movies out there and if you haven't seen it, you should. And don't miss the blink and miss act by Vince Vaughan and John Favreau (the director of Iron Man 1 and 2) as a desperate-for-girls guy who teaches Rudy. Thank you Gaurav Mehta for another splendid recommendation.

    Rudy is a story of the underdog who rises from modest beginnings into a brave, admirable character. Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors. Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted. Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream. In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance. The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment. Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clich&eacute;s monitor the area. So why is Rudy a "good" film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself. I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones. Starring: Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by: David Anspaugh.

    This is a movie that I could watch 100 times and never once get tired of it, it's such a great David vs. Goliath movie. Rudy was a small guy who everyone told you're never going to play for Notre Dame and for good reason, he was 5'9" and weighed next to nothing. He had to fight just to get into Notre Dame as a student by going to Holy Cross for 2 years. Then once he got to ND he tried out for the football team as a walkon. With his absolute never giving up on any of the plays they let him participate in practice as a member of the scout team. But even with that it looked like he would never actually make it into a game. Rudy got coach Ara Parseghian to promise to let him suit up for a game for 1 game during his senior year. But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy. Rudy had won himself over to the rest of the team and the rest of the team threatened to walk out if Rudy didn't get a chance to suit up for a game so Devine finally relented.

    A young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this sports drama entitled,Rudy.This is a film that gives an account of the life of Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh. Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6" and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, "Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!" After "walking on" as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or "scout") squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a "Rudy!" chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates. The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life.

    I saw Rudy on a sunny morning as I had nothing better to do. This movie is so much more than just a kid running behind a football. It is so much more. You start off seeing this kid who is a 5 footer and does not even weigh a 150 pounds who has a larger than life dream. This movie makes you believe that if you do have a dream and you want it badly enough and if you are willing to work for it hard enough there will come along unseen angels who will help you fulfill it. It might be the groundsman(Fortune), D-Bob or all the players on the Norte Dame football team, there will be people who will pull you through thick and thin. The performance by Sean Austin is moving. He portrays the character of Rudy with such ease that you will begin to believe that this is how the real Rudy Ruettiger would have been. The direction and screenplay are of top notch quality. If you do truly connect to the movie the last seconds of the game when Rudy comes on the pitch and makes his tackle will indeed move you to tears. He does deserve to be carried off the field. For an excellently well made movie with one of the strongest characters I've seen on screen and the sheer heart displayed by that young man I give this movie a 10/10.

    It's about the guy who once had a dream, but he was always listening others about how he cannot reach it. His name is Rudy and he's big fan of Notre dame football team, his childhood dream is to play for them or at least to made a debut for them. Whole his family was watching them and they were big supporters of them, every Sunday they were in front of television watching them. After graduation of high school, he couldn't go to Notre dame college since he had bad grades so his dream just fall in river. He decided to start working family job, in steel mill. After death of his best friend, Pete, he decided to get back to college, but yet again his grades were too low for this one, so he had to go to other one called Holy Cross College. After some years in Holy Cross College, he got applied to Norte Dame and his dream got real. He was good student, he was getting better and better grades, playing for football team and one pretty impressive fact is he never missed any of trainings in those 2 years of playing. But, he wasn't good enough for those guys due his psychical problems. His teammates were just too strong for him, but Rudy had a faith, he had a dream that he's going to reach one day and hearth.

    This is a movie that I could watch 100 times and never once get tired of it, it's such a great David vs. Goliath movie. Rudy was a small guy who everyone told you're never going to play for Notre Dame and for good reason, he was 5'9" and weighed next to nothing. He had to fight just to get into Notre Dame as a student by going to Holy Cross for 2 years. Then once he got to ND he tried out for the football team as a walkon. With his absolute never giving up on any of the plays they let him participate in practice as a member of the scout team. But even with that it looked like he would never actually make it into a game. Rudy got coach Ara Parseghian to promise to let him suit up for a game for 1 game during his senior year. But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy. Rudy had won himself over to the rest of the team and the rest of the team threatened to walk out if Rudy didn't get a chance to suit up for a game so Devine finally relented.

    A young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this sports drama entitled,Rudy.This is a film that gives an account of the life of Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh. Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6" and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, "Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!" After "walking on" as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or "scout") squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a "Rudy!" chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates. The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life.

    I saw Rudy on a sunny morning as I had nothing better to do. This movie is so much more than just a kid running behind a football. It is so much more. You start off seeing this kid who is a 5 footer and does not even weigh a 150 pounds who has a larger than life dream. This movie makes you believe that if you do have a dream and you want it badly enough and if you are willing to work for it hard enough there will come along unseen angels who will help you fulfill it. It might be the groundsman(Fortune), D-Bob or all the players on the Norte Dame football team, there will be people who will pull you through thick and thin. The performance by Sean Austin is moving. He portrays the character of Rudy with such ease that you will begin to believe that this is how the real Rudy Ruettiger would have been. The direction and screenplay are of top notch quality. If you do truly connect to the movie the last seconds of the game when Rudy comes on the pitch and makes his tackle will indeed move you to tears. He does deserve to be carried off the field. For an excellently well made movie with one of the strongest characters I've seen on screen and the sheer heart displayed by that young man I give this movie a 10/10.

    It's about the guy who once had a dream, but he was always listening others about how he cannot reach it. His name is Rudy and he's big fan of Notre dame football team, his childhood dream is to play for them or at least to made a debut for them. Whole his family was watching them and they were big supporters of them, every Sunday they were in front of television watching them. After graduation of high school, he couldn't go to Notre dame college since he had bad grades so his dream just fall in river. He decided to start working family job, in steel mill. After death of his best friend, Pete, he decided to get back to college, but yet again his grades were too low for this one, so he had to go to other one called Holy Cross College. After some years in Holy Cross College, he got applied to Norte Dame and his dream got real. He was good student, he was getting better and better grades, playing for football team and one pretty impressive fact is he never missed any of trainings in those 2 years of playing. But, he wasn't good enough for those guys due his psychical problems. His teammates were just too strong for him, but Rudy had a faith, he had a dream that he's going to reach one day and hearth. His teammates noticed it and they respected that. They were impressed of how he can go so hard even though he got refused many times. And before their last game, they decided to help him reaching his dream by talking on their trainer to put him in first team. Trainer wasn't alright with that decision but he made it, he put him as sub. He made his debut match against Georgia tech, whole stadium was screaming his name. Rudy reached his dream, his parents, brothers, friend were proud of him. If you like inspirations movies this one is perfect for you, for binging up your motivation. I must mention that this movie is based on true story.

    The most amazing thing about this movie is that I didn't slip into a long term comma before the end. In fact, the other night I painted the living room... and I have to say, watching the paint dry was more entertaining than this film. The entire script is non eventful. The acting is shallow and one dimensional. I think a cardboard cutout would have been more convincing in the lead role. And the ending is totally predictable (if you can make it to the end without falling asleep). It could have been a great story, but somehow they've managed to turn a potentially inspiring story into something more boring than watching a Bob Ross show in slow motion. Icing on the cake, is the grandiose sound track. It just doesn't match what your viewing. There's nothing happening and the overly orchestrated background music sounds as if something incredible is going on. When in fact, nothing vital to the "underdog defeats the world" plot is going on. And sad thing is, the underdog is somebody you don't really care about, or can relate to and by the end of the film you wish he would just go away.

    I guess it is just assumed that every Notre Dame fan likes the movie Rudy. I don't, so I guess that makes me an anomaly. Now that I've got that out of the way, this movie does a good job with playing the underdog card. The acting is good, and it does not detract in almost any of the scenes. An exception may be some of the football player actors. Slightly clunky lines and delivery there, but nothing that derails the narrative. Also, the cinematography is great; this is a very beautiful looking film. I also think the movie did a good job of capturing the feeling of the University of Notre Dame on football Saturday. So why do I not like this movie? The based on a true story claim. Look, I get that Hollywood needs to take certain liberties with the facts to make it a better product, but this movie is an instance where it just goes too far. I don't actually know much about Rudy's personal life, I am referring more to the actual finale of the movie. There are plenty of accounts of the inaccuracies of the ending game and buildup, so I won't go into it. And while I don't like some of the liberties taken with facts, I HATE the depiction of Dan Devine in this movie. This movie didn't need to have an antagonist. It is incredibly lazy how they wrote him to be a stereotypical jerk who won't let the protagonist succeed at any cost. Devine was nice guy in real life who became a convenient scapegoat for this smaltzy movie. That is absolutely TERRIBLE writing.

    OK, a few scenes I liked: the scene with the walk-on tryouts where the assistant coach tells them they can expect to get pounded on by the first teamers, and nobody cares whether they get hurt or not. Also during Rudy's senior year, the background music and late autumn scenes were both breathtaking, yet with the realization that time was running out on Rudy's last season and his last chance to play. Finally, it was neat to see how the other players gradually came to appreciate Rudy for his stick-to-itiveness, to the point where each of the starters asked Coach Divine to let Rudy dress in their place. Only problem with that: in real life it never happened that way. Coach Divine had every intention to let Rudy play and was rather angry that the movie portrayed him otherwise. Still though, it added to the drama. My favorite scene of all is when Fortune (Charles Dutton)encourages Rudy to go to his final practice because if he doesn't, he'll regret it for the rest of his life, "letting them get the best of you". My only criticism is with the excessive profanity coming from Rudy's friend at Holy Cross. I try not to let a few bad words bother me, but when it's excessive and really adds nothing whatsoever to the story. I mean, really, how would this movie have been any worse without the friend's repeated use of "G..D.."? Without those scenes, this movie is a 10. Overall, very inspiring, even if you're not a football fan.

    I just caught this on Sunday afternoon TV, I live down under, born and bred in Holland, and have no real interest in Grid Iron, hey I only know the real Football (soccer), but man I really like this great story. It was great to watch a film that had no sex drugs or rock and roll, just a great story about a small bloke trying his best to prove every one wrong, that size does not matter! I myself am 6'4' 250 pounds, and grew another foot in height on the inside, just a great simple direct to the point film about courage and inner strength! 8 out of 10 for this most see good feel film

    3.5/5 This movie is for all those people who constantly hear that they are not fit or good enough to do something, that they are inadequate. Rudy is small in stature. So his father and his brothers tell him that he cannot achieve his goal of playing football for the Notre Dame which is what he dreams about all the time. His grades are down the drain, so he cannot apply to that university as a student. The movie is the true story of what he does to prove everyone wrong and seize the day. This is a "underdog takes on the world and wins" movie in the league of the far widely known Rocky. But this is one of the better sports movies out there and if you haven't seen it, you should. And don't miss the blink and miss act by Vince Vaughan and John Favreau (the director of Iron Man 1 and 2) as a desperate-for-girls guy who teaches Rudy. Thank you Gaurav Mehta for another splendid recommendation.

    Rudy is a story of the underdog who rises from modest beginnings into a brave, admirable character. Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors. Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted. Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream. In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance. The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment. Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clich&eacute;s monitor the area. So why is Rudy a "good" film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself. I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones. Starring: Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by: David Anspaugh.

There are plenty of accounts of the inaccuracies of the ending game and buildup, so I won't go into it. And while I don't like some of the liberties taken with facts, I HATE the depiction of Dan Devine in this movie. This movie didn't need to have an antagonist. It is incredibly lazy how they wrote him to be a stereotypical jerk who won't let the protagonist succeed at any cost. Devine was nice guy in real life who became a convenient scapegoat for this smaltzy movie. That is absolutely TERRIBLE writing.

    OK, a few scenes I liked: the scene with the walk-on tryouts where the assistant coach tells them they can expect to get pounded on by the first teamers, and nobody cares whether they get hurt or not. Also during Rudy's senior year, the background music and late autumn scenes were both breathtaking, yet with the realization that time was running out on Rudy's last season and his last chance to play. Finally, it was neat to see how the other players gradually came to appreciate Rudy for his stick-to-itiveness, to the point where each of the starters asked Coach Divine to let Rudy dress in their place. Only problem with that: in real life it never happened that way. Coach Divine had every intention to let Rudy play and was rather angry that the movie portrayed him otherwise. Still though, it added to the drama. My favorite scene of all is when Fortune (Charles Dutton)encourages Rudy to go to his final practice because if he doesn't, he'll regret it for the rest of his life, "letting them get the best of you". My only criticism is with the excessive profanity coming from Rudy's friend at Holy Cross. I try not to let a few bad words bother me, but when it's excessive and really adds nothing whatsoever to the story. I mean, really, how would this movie have been any worse without the friend's repeated use of "G..D.."? Without those scenes, this movie is a 10. Overall, very inspiring, even if you're not a football fan.

    I just caught this on Sunday afternoon TV, I live down under, born and bred in Holland, and have no real interest in Grid Iron, hey I only know the real Football (soccer), but man I really like this great story. It was great to watch a film that had no sex drugs or rock and roll, just a great story about a small bloke trying his best to prove every one wrong, that size does not matter! I myself am 6'4' 250 pounds, and grew another foot in height on the inside, just a great simple direct to the point film about courage and inner strength! 8 out of 10 for this most see good feel film

    3.5/5 This movie is for all those people who constantly hear that they are not fit or good enough to do something, that they are inadequate. Rudy is small in stature. So his father and his brothers tell him that he cannot achieve his goal of playing football for the Notre Dame which is what he dreams about all the time. His grades are down the drain, so he cannot apply to that university as a student. The movie is the true story of what he does to prove everyone wrong and seize the day. This is a "underdog takes on the world and wins" movie in the league of the far widely known Rocky. But this is one of the better sports movies out there and if you haven't seen it, you should. And don't miss the blink and miss act by Vince Vaughan and John Favreau (the director of Iron Man 1 and 2) as a desperate-for-girls guy who teaches Rudy. Thank you Gaurav Mehta for another splendid recommendation.

    Rudy is a story of the underdog who rises from modest beginnings into a brave, admirable character. Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors. Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted. Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream. In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance. The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment. Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clich&eacute;s monitor the area. So why is Rudy a "good" film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself. I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones. Starring: Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by: David Anspaugh.

    This is a movie that I could watch 100 times and never once get tired of it, it's such a great David vs. Goliath movie. Rudy was a small guy who everyone told you're never going to play for Notre Dame and for good reason, he was 5'9" and weighed next to nothing. He had to fight just to get into Notre Dame as a student by going to Holy Cross for 2 years. Then once he got to ND he tried out for the football team as a walkon. With his absolute never giving up on any of the plays they let him participate in practice as a member of the scout team. But even with that it looked like he would never actually make it into a game. Rudy got coach Ara Parseghian to promise to let him suit up for a game for 1 game during his senior year. But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy. Rudy had won himself over to the rest of the team and the rest of the team threatened to walk out if Rudy didn't get a chance to suit up for a game so Devine finally relented.

    A young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this sports drama entitled,Rudy.This is a film that gives an account of the life of Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh. Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6" and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, "Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!" After "walking on" as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or "scout") squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a "Rudy!" chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates. The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life.

    I saw Rudy on a sunny morning as I had nothing better to do. This movie is so much more than just a kid running behind a football. It is so much more. You start off seeing this kid who is a 5 footer and does not even weigh a 150 pounds who has a larger than life dream. This movie makes you believe that if you do have a dream and you want it badly enough and if you are willing to work for it hard enough there will come along unseen angels who will help you fulfill it. It might be the groundsman(Fortune), D-Bob or all the players on the Norte Dame football team, there will be people who will pull you through thick and thin. The performance by Sean Austin is moving. He portrays the character of Rudy with such ease that you will begin to believe that this is how the real Rudy Ruettiger would have been. The direction and screenplay are of top notch quality. If you do truly connect to the movie the last seconds of the game when Rudy comes on the pitch and makes his tackle will indeed move you to tears. He does deserve to be carried off the field. For an excellently well made movie with one of the strongest characters I've seen on screen and the sheer heart displayed by that young man I give this movie a 10/10.

    It's about the guy who once had a dream, but he was always listening others about how he cannot reach it. His name is Rudy and he's big fan of Notre dame football team, his childhood dream is to play for them or at least to made a debut for them. Whole his family was watching them and they were big supporters of them, every Sunday they were in front of television watching them. After graduation of high school, he couldn't go to Notre dame college since he had bad grades so his dream just fall in river. He decided to start working family job, in steel mill. After death of his best friend, Pete, he decided to get back to college, but yet again his grades were too low for this one, so he had to go to other one called Holy Cross College. After some years in Holy Cross College, he got applied to Norte Dame and his dream got real. He was good student, he was getting better and better grades, playing for football team and one pretty impressive fact is he never missed any of trainings in those 2 years of playing. But, he wasn't good enough for those guys due his psychical problems. His teammates were just too strong for him, but Rudy had a faith, he had a dream that he's going to reach one day and hearth. His teammates noticed it and they respected that. They were impressed of how he can go so hard even though he got refused many times. And before their last game, they decided to help him reaching his dream by talking on their trainer to put him in first team. Trainer wasn't alright with that decision but he made it, he put him as sub. He made his debut match against Georgia tech, whole stadium was screaming his name. Rudy reached his dream, his parents, brothers, friend were proud of him. If you like inspirations movies this one is perfect for you, for binging up your motivation. I must mention that this movie is based on true story.

    The most amazing thing about this movie is that I didn't slip into a long term comma before the end. In fact, the other night I painted the living room... and I have to say, watching the paint dry was more entertaining than this film. The entire script is non eventful. The acting is shallow and one dimensional. I think a cardboard cutout would have been more convincing in the lead role. And the ending is totally predictable (if you can make it to the end without falling asleep). It could have been a great story, but somehow they've managed to turn a potentially inspiring story into something more boring than watching a Bob Ross show in slow motion. Icing on the cake, is the grandiose sound track. It just doesn't match what your viewing. There's nothing happening and the overly orchestrated background music sounds as if something incredible is going on. When in fact, nothing vital to the "underdog defeats the world" plot is going on. And sad thing is, the underdog is somebody you don't really care about, or can relate to and by the end of the film you wish he would just go away.

    I guess it is just assumed that every Notre Dame fan likes the movie Rudy. I don't, so I guess that makes me an anomaly. Now that I've got that out of the way, this movie does a good job with playing the underdog card. The acting is good, and it does not detract in almost any of the scenes. An exception may be some of the football player actors. Slightly clunky lines and delivery there, but nothing that derails the narrative. Also, the cinematography is great; this is a very beautiful looking film. I also think the movie did a good job of capturing the feeling of the University of Notre Dame on football Saturday. So why do I not like this movie? The based on a true story claim. Look, I get that Hollywood needs to take certain liberties with the facts to make it a better product, but this movie is an instance where it just goes too far. I don't actually know much about Rudy's personal life, I am referring more to the actual finale of the movie. There are plenty of accounts of the inaccuracies of the ending game and buildup, so I won't go into it. And while I don't like some of the liberties taken with facts, I HATE the depiction of Dan Devine in this movie. This movie didn't need to have an antagonist.

He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, "Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!" After "walking on" as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or "scout") squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a "Rudy!" chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates. The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life.

    I saw Rudy on a sunny morning as I had nothing better to do. This movie is so much more than just a kid running behind a football. It is so much more. You start off seeing this kid who is a 5 footer and does not even weigh a 150 pounds who has a larger than life dream. This movie makes you believe that if you do have a dream and you want it badly enough and if you are willing to work for it hard enough there will come along unseen angels who will help you fulfill it. It might be the groundsman(Fortune), D-Bob or all the players on the Norte Dame football team, there will be people who will pull you through thick and thin. The performance by Sean Austin is moving. He portrays the character of Rudy with such ease that you will begin to believe that this is how the real Rudy Ruettiger would have been. The direction and screenplay are of top notch quality. If you do truly connect to the movie the last seconds of the game when Rudy comes on the pitch and makes his tackle will indeed move you to tears. He does deserve to be carried off the field. For an excellently well made movie with one of the strongest characters I've seen on screen and the sheer heart displayed by that young man I give this movie a 10/10.

    It's about the guy who once had a dream, but he was always listening others about how he cannot reach it. His name is Rudy and he's big fan of Notre dame football team, his childhood dream is to play for them or at least to made a debut for them. Whole his family was watching them and they were big supporters of them, every Sunday they were in front of television watching them. After graduation of high school, he couldn't go to Notre dame college since he had bad grades so his dream just fall in river. He decided to start working family job, in steel mill. After death of his best friend, Pete, he decided to get back to college, but yet again his grades were too low for this one, so he had to go to other one called Holy Cross College. After some years in Holy Cross College, he got applied to Norte Dame and his dream got real. He was good student, he was getting better and better grades, playing for football team and one pretty impressive fact is he never missed any of trainings in those 2 years of playing. But, he wasn't good enough for those guys due his psychical problems. His teammates were just too strong for him, but Rudy had a faith, he had a dream that he's going to reach one day and hearth. His teammates noticed it and they respected that. They were impressed of how he can go so hard even though he got refused many times. And before their last game, they decided to help him reaching his dream by talking on their trainer to put him in first team. Trainer wasn't alright with that decision but he made it, he put him as sub. He made his debut match against Georgia tech, whole stadium was screaming his name. Rudy reached his dream, his parents, brothers, friend were proud of him. If you like inspirations movies this one is perfect for you, for binging up your motivation. I must mention that this movie is based on true story.

    The most amazing thing about this movie is that I didn't slip into a long term comma before the end. In fact, the other night I painted the living room... and I have to say, watching the paint dry was more entertaining than this film. The entire script is non eventful. The acting is shallow and one dimensional. I think a cardboard cutout would have been more convincing in the lead role. And the ending is totally predictable (if you can make it to the end without falling asleep). It could have been a great story, but somehow they've managed to turn a potentially inspiring story into something more boring than watching a Bob Ross show in slow motion. Icing on the cake, is the grandiose sound track. It just doesn't match what your viewing. There's nothing happening and the overly orchestrated background music sounds as if something incredible is going on. When in fact, nothing vital to the "underdog defeats the world" plot is going on. And sad thing is, the underdog is somebody you don't really care about, or can relate to and by the end of the film you wish he would just go away.

    I guess it is just assumed that every Notre Dame fan likes the movie Rudy. I don't, so I guess that makes me an anomaly. Now that I've got that out of the way, this movie does a good job with playing the underdog card. The acting is good, and it does not detract in almost any of the scenes. An exception may be some of the football player actors. Slightly clunky lines and delivery there, but nothing that derails the narrative. Also, the cinematography is great; this is a very beautiful looking film. I also think the movie did a good job of capturing the feeling of the University of Notre Dame on football Saturday. So why do I not like this movie? The based on a true story claim. Look, I get that Hollywood needs to take certain liberties with the facts to make it a better product, but this movie is an instance where it just goes too far. I don't actually know much about Rudy's personal life, I am referring more to the actual finale of the movie. There are plenty of accounts of the inaccuracies of the ending game and buildup, so I won't go into it. And while I don't like some of the liberties taken with facts, I HATE the depiction of Dan Devine in this movie. This movie didn't need to have an antagonist. It is incredibly lazy how they wrote him to be a stereotypical jerk who won't let the protagonist succeed at any cost. Devine was nice guy in real life who became a convenient scapegoat for this smaltzy movie. That is absolutely TERRIBLE writing.

    OK, a few scenes I liked: the scene with the walk-on tryouts where the assistant coach tells them they can expect to get pounded on by the first teamers, and nobody cares whether they get hurt or not. Also during Rudy's senior year, the background music and late autumn scenes were both breathtaking, yet with the realization that time was running out on Rudy's last season and his last chance to play. Finally, it was neat to see how the other players gradually came to appreciate Rudy for his stick-to-itiveness, to the point where each of the starters asked Coach Divine to let Rudy dress in their place. Only problem with that: in real life it never happened that way. Coach Divine had every intention to let Rudy play and was rather angry that the movie portrayed him otherwise. Still though, it added to the drama. My favorite scene of all is when Fortune (Charles Dutton)encourages Rudy to go to his final practice because if he doesn't, he'll regret it for the rest of his life, "letting them get the best of you". My only criticism is with the excessive profanity coming from Rudy's friend at Holy Cross. I try not to let a few bad words bother me, but when it's excessive and really adds nothing whatsoever to the story. I mean, really, how would this movie have been any worse without the friend's repeated use of "G..D.."? Without those scenes, this movie is a 10. Overall, very inspiring, even if you're not a football fan.

    I just caught this on Sunday afternoon TV, I live down under, born and bred in Holland, and have no real interest in Grid Iron, hey I only know the real Football (soccer), but man I really like this great story. It was great to watch a film that had no sex drugs or rock and roll, just a great story about a small bloke trying his best to prove every one wrong, that size does not matter! I myself am 6'4' 250 pounds, and grew another foot in height on the inside, just a great simple direct to the point film about courage and inner strength! 8 out of 10 for this most see good feel film

    3.5/5 This movie is for all those people who constantly hear that they are not fit or good enough to do something, that they are inadequate. Rudy is small in stature. So his father and his brothers tell him that he cannot achieve his goal of playing football for the Notre Dame which is what he dreams about all the time. His grades are down the drain, so he cannot apply to that university as a student. The movie is the true story of what he does to prove everyone wrong and seize the day. This is a "underdog takes on the world and wins" movie in the league of the far widely known Rocky. But this is one of the better sports movies out there and if you haven't seen it, you should. And don't miss the blink and miss act by Vince Vaughan and John Favreau (the director of Iron Man 1 and 2) as a desperate-for-girls guy who teaches Rudy. Thank you Gaurav Mehta for another splendid recommendation.

    Rudy is a story of the underdog who rises from modest beginnings into a brave, admirable character. Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors. Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted. Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream. In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance. The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment. Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clich&eacute;s monitor the area. So why is Rudy a "good" film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself. I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones. Starring: Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by: David Anspaugh.

    This is a movie that I could watch 100 times and never once get tired of it, it's such a great David vs. Goliath movie. Rudy was a small guy who everyone told you're never going to play for Notre Dame and for good reason, he was 5'9" and weighed next to nothing. He had to fight just to get into Notre Dame as a student by going to Holy Cross for 2 years. Then once he got to ND he tried out for the football team as a walkon. With his absolute never giving up on any of the plays they let him participate in practice as a member of the scout team. But even with that it looked like he would never actually make it into a game. Rudy got coach Ara Parseghian to promise to let him suit up for a game for 1 game during his senior year. But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy. Rudy had won himself over to the rest of the team and the rest of the team threatened to walk out if Rudy didn't get a chance to suit up for a game so Devine finally relented.

    A young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this sports drama entitled,Rudy.This is a film that gives an account of the life of Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh. Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6" and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, "Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!"

I myself am 6'4' 250 pounds, and grew another foot in height on the inside, just a great simple direct to the point film about courage and inner strength! 8 out of 10 for this most see good feel film

    3.5/5 This movie is for all those people who constantly hear that they are not fit or good enough to do something, that they are inadequate. Rudy is small in stature. So his father and his brothers tell him that he cannot achieve his goal of playing football for the Notre Dame which is what he dreams about all the time. His grades are down the drain, so he cannot apply to that university as a student. The movie is the true story of what he does to prove everyone wrong and seize the day. This is a "underdog takes on the world and wins" movie in the league of the far widely known Rocky. But this is one of the better sports movies out there and if you haven't seen it, you should. And don't miss the blink and miss act by Vince Vaughan and John Favreau (the director of Iron Man 1 and 2) as a desperate-for-girls guy who teaches Rudy. Thank you Gaurav Mehta for another splendid recommendation.

    Rudy is a story of the underdog who rises from modest beginnings into a brave, admirable character. Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors. Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted. Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream. In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance. The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment. Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clich&eacute;s monitor the area. So why is Rudy a "good" film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself. I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones. Starring: Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by: David Anspaugh.

    This is a movie that I could watch 100 times and never once get tired of it, it's such a great David vs. Goliath movie. Rudy was a small guy who everyone told you're never going to play for Notre Dame and for good reason, he was 5'9" and weighed next to nothing. He had to fight just to get into Notre Dame as a student by going to Holy Cross for 2 years. Then once he got to ND he tried out for the football team as a walkon. With his absolute never giving up on any of the plays they let him participate in practice as a member of the scout team. But even with that it looked like he would never actually make it into a game. Rudy got coach Ara Parseghian to promise to let him suit up for a game for 1 game during his senior year. But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy. Rudy had won himself over to the rest of the team and the rest of the team threatened to walk out if Rudy didn't get a chance to suit up for a game so Devine finally relented.

    A young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this sports drama entitled,Rudy.This is a film that gives an account of the life of Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh. Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6" and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, "Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!" After "walking on" as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or "scout") squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a "Rudy!" chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates. The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life.

    I saw Rudy on a sunny morning as I had nothing better to do. This movie is so much more than just a kid running behind a football. It is so much more. You start off seeing this kid who is a 5 footer and does not even weigh a 150 pounds who has a larger than life dream. This movie makes you believe that if you do have a dream and you want it badly enough and if you are willing to work for it hard enough there will come along unseen angels who will help you fulfill it. It might be the groundsman(Fortune), D-Bob or all the players on the Norte Dame football team, there will be people who will pull you through thick and thin. The performance by Sean Austin is moving. He portrays the character of Rudy with such ease that you will begin to believe that this is how the real Rudy Ruettiger would have been. The direction and screenplay are of top notch quality. If you do truly connect to the movie the last seconds of the game when Rudy comes on the pitch and makes his tackle will indeed move you to tears. He does deserve to be carried off the field. For an excellently well made movie with one of the strongest characters I've seen on screen and the sheer heart displayed by that young man I give this movie a 10/10.
