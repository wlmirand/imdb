    If you would like to watch the most humblest, kindest, generous child ever on screen, then this 1936 adaption of the classic " Little Lord Fauntleroy " is perfect for you. Freddie Bartholomew is absolutely irresistible as the impeccably polite Cedric, a role that seems tailored made just for him. C. Aubrey Smith's performance is strong and convincing, and even a little, scene stealing as the cantankerous grandfather, The Earl Of Dorincourt. Dolores Costello is lovely playing the gentle Dearest. Even the Lord's brusque Great Dane gives in to the charms of "Ceddie." Add Mickey Rooney, Guy Kibbee, along with a host of superb supporting actors all perfectly portraying their parts. The results are a first class, and outstanding film of a classic story. A very delightful and heartwarming picture, for all ages to enjoy. A must see for your list of early classic movies.

    The book by Frances Hodgson Burnett was published in the 1880s and carried a simple message: humanitarianism is better than arrogance. This is William James' distinction between the tough minded and the tender minded. I must be one of the former because I found it a nonpareil of sentimental and inelegant pap. Pardon me while I light an expensive cigar and stomp the cat. Sheesh, how triumph follows tragedy and vice versa. Freddy Bartholomew is a nine-year-old boy living in genteel poverty with his loving mother ("Dearest") in a crummy neighborhood in Brooklyn. But not the real Brooklyn of the 1880s. This is a fairyland Brooklyn where there is no garbage or horse manure on the streets, and where Freddy's pal, Mickey Rooney, only betrays his lack of breeding by saying "erl" instead of "oil" and never busts Freddy in the snot locker. Freddy loves his pals, who include the greengrocer, and everybody loves Freddy, just as love loves to love love. I almost burst into sobs when a lawyer arrives from England and informs Freddy that, since he is the only surviving grandson of the Earl of Dorincourt, he's invited to come to England, join his grandfather in the family mansion, and be inculcated into the aristoi. The present Earl is a bilious and bushy old man who knows no pity except for himself. He hates Freddy's mother and she must live elsewhere, not in the mansion. He treats his tenant farmers the way they treat their dirt. Freddy, though, is a winsome little lad, naive and generous. To a fault, one might say. And before you know it, Freddy has the crotchety old curmudgeon learning how to be generous and kind -- in an old fashioned way, of course. He's not going to give the family silverware to the poor. He's just not going to berate the servants quite as much. Then tragedy strikes, and just when it seems things are going so well. Another woman shows up with a lollipop-sucking son who is older than Freddy, and SHE claims to be the first wife of the son of the current Earl. And, believe me, this babe is a real wasp. She laughs and taunts the white-haired old man who has grown to love Freddy, just as everyone else loves Freddy. Do things turn out all right? Is there a happy ending? Doesn't it prompt you to weep when you hear "Auld Lang Syne" played adagio? On a solo violin? Well, Freddy Bartholomew is unquestionably cute in appearance, speech, and demeanor although, to be sure, a little fist fight in the schoolyard might have done him a power of good. Actually, the illustrations in Hodgson's book started a sartorial fad and kids began to dress like Little Lord Fauntleroy in outfits that resembled little sailor suits with lace collars. The fad lasted for years. I believe there's a photo of young Ernest Hemingway floating around out there somewhere in the ether. The character of Little Lord Fauntleroy is winning, precisely because it's so improbable. The whole movie is as fantastic as The Wizard of Oz. C. Aubrey Smith is great as the grumbling old Earl, only reluctantly won over by his new grandson. Dolores Costello as "Dearest" always looks as if she's wearing a brave smile to keep from breaking into sobs of some sort, grief or gratitude -- it doesn't matter. Like so much sentimental material it has its charm. But that's about all it has, sentiment and charm. There's not a laugh in it, and there's no edginess to it. We know at once that the mistaken people will realize their errors, that the bad people will be punished or thwarted, and that the good people will be rewarded. A bit of edge might not have hurt. Have Freddy sneak a few puffs on a corn silk cigarette or something.

    Freddie Bartholomew, the little British lad with the face of an angel and a sweet disposition, is the title character in this classic David O. Selznick version of the famous story. He steals your heart as he plays wonderfully touching scenes with C. Aubrey Smith whereby his character charms the gruff old man and softens his heart forever. The plot has Smith resenting the lad because he thinks so little of the boy's mother, through a misunderstanding of her true character. All of these things are swept aside by the time the story reaches its conclusion, with boy, mother and grandfather all reunited for a happy ending. I have to say that C. Aubrey Smith, the venerable old actor who stole scenes in many a British film, is at his finest in this particular role. Using his bushy eyebrows and monocle for great effect, his expressions of anger, joy, surprise or stern contempt are beautifully executed. What an actor! I don't think he ever showed such range in any other of his memorable character roles. Never for a moment intimidated by his gruff grandfather, Freddie stands up to him in scene after scene, matching him for pure professionalism. He too delivers a standout performance as the polite but resolute lad who worships his loving mother (Dolores Costello) whom he calls "Dearest." Mickey Rooney and Guy Kibbe are excellent in good supporting roles. John Cromwell's detailed direction is superb for this charming, if old-fashioned tale played to perfection by Freddie Bartholomew and C. Aubrey Smith. Notice how Cromwell even fleshes out background scenes with a single paper boy working hard to attract buyers while adding reality to a street scene focused on two other characters in the forefront.

    This film, although almost unbelievably dated, is a work of fine quality and utterly charming. It certainly is something special when it comes to the plot. This is the story of a little boy with a normal life who could have never imagined he was a heir of the title Earl of Dorincourt. Dutty calls this boy. Make no mistake: this is an endearing story. This fine-mannered curly-haired little lord captivates the Earl so much that the austere old man has a change of heart. He truly cares for this boy in a way he never though he could care about a child. Freddie Bartholomew's special acting as the Little Lord Fauntleroy is simply divine. Dolores Costello too is divine as "Dearest". As for C. Aubrey Smith, his acting as the old Earl is captivating. Mickey Rooney is hilarious as Dick Tipton. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    This film is like a little box of surprises. True, it looks and feels as aged as it is, but that's exactly this old-fashioned charm that makes it fun. The plot is an unexpected surprise in the positive sense. This plot is certainly original, unique and unusual, different from other films regardless of the era. The plot concerns a widowed mother and her son Ceddie living in America in the 1880's. Ceddie likes to call her "Dearest". That is another surprise. I've never seen a movie with someone calling their mother "Dearest" before. I find that quite cute. Ceddie seems popular where he lives, everybody likes him (except the bullies, of course) and he is very nice to everyone. Meanwhile, Ceddie's grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt, wants the boy to be brought to England to be his heir, as he has no more living sons. However, the Earl does not allow his mother to live in his castle. Ceddie gets devastated but "Dearest" does everything she can to convince him that the man is a very generous person, not touching on subjects that could be traumatic for the kid. The Earl, although reluctant at first, gets deeply impressed with the boy from the start. He, a bitter and cranky old man who always hated children, never thought he could be so fond of a child. Ceddie believes in the Earl's generosity so much that the stern old man really becomes generous. He couldn't have found a better heir. Ceddie is so delicate, so polite and has such aristocratic manners. This cute curly-haired boy has the face of an angel and the posture and manners of a little prince... or lord. He definitely conquers the old man's heart. They have a perfect chemistry from the very start. Even when an information that tells that Ceddie is not the real heir, the Earl is so proud of him that he doesn't want anyone else as his heir. He even gets to see the supposed real heir but dislikes him and thinks he is annoying. His wish is granted and he even allows Ceddie's mother to live in the castle in the ending. Freddie Bartholomew is noble as Ceddie, Dolores Costello is wonderful as "Dearest", C. Aubrey Smith has dignity as the Earl of Dorincourt and it's fun to see a very young Mickey Rooney as the bootblack and Ceddie's friend Dick Tipton. Mickey Rooney is like a comic relief, to which the actor's hilarious accent and charismatic acting contribute greatly. Guy Kibbee is fine as Mr. Hobbs... This precious little film should be properly restored to improve its slight audio flaws, as well as its many image scratches and "bounces", characteristic flaws in very old movies. Title in Portugal: 'O Pequeno Lorde'.

    "Little Lord Fauntleroy" is a tale about a lonely but extremely gruff old English Lord discovering that his estranged grandson in America is a wonderful child. It also includes the boy teaching the man humility and gentleness along the way. This is the third version of this story that I have seen and the second one I've seen recently. While I am sure there are other versions of this classic tale out there as well, I can't imagine any of them being better than this lovely 1936 version. Even with the ridiculous casting of the very English-sounding Freddie Bartholomew in the lead (he's supposed to be an American), the film is just wonderful. C. Aubry Smith is delightful as Bartholomew's gruff grandfather, but everyone else in the film also seemed so well-cast. This, combined with great sets, direction and the full David O. Selznick touch make this a terrific film for all ages. One not to be missed.

    The famous children's novel later made into a play is a vehicle that is perfectly suited for MGM's British born child star Freddie Bartholomew. Little Lord Fauntleroy can well be said to be his perfect role during his childhood years with Leo the Lion. Little Lord Fauntleroy was first published in 1885 and it concerns young Cedric Erroll who is living in Brooklyn in reduced circumstances with his mother due to the recent death of his father. Who as it turns out was the last surviving heir to an earldom back across the pond. Which brings Henry Stephenson over from the United Kingdom to tell Dolores Costello and her son Freddie Bartholomew that the young lad is now the new Earl to be of Dorrincourt once the old Earl, C. Aubrey Smith has passed on. Smith is one crusty old dude, but if you had lived as long as he had and seen all your sons predecease you, you might be bitter as well. And set in your ways and prejudices. One of the conditions is that Dolores Costello can come over as well, but she has to live separate and apart from her child as the Earl of Dorrincourt does not like those rebellious colonials and never forgave his son for marrying one. But cute and mannered young Freddie charms the old guy as only Freddie Bartholomew could back in those days and Smith warms up to the lad. However then another claimant comes on the horizon, Helen Flint says that she was the wife of an older deceased son and she's got a son by him played by Jackie Searl. Rounding out the principal players are Guy Kibbee who is the local grocer where Costello and Bartholomew live, in Brooklyn of all places and Mickey Rooney a pal from those mean streets who actually hold the key to the inheritance problem. Little Lord Fauntleroy was old fashioned even for 1936, it is set perfectly during the time of 1885. With the UK and USA going through two hot World Wars and one Cold War, the prejudices shown by Smith and Kibbee who starts out as a big Anglophobe despite liking Bartholomew are quaint to say the least. But the film does have a nostalgic charm about it though I daresay the play made from the original novel hasn't been too much revived. Probably the novel itself is still on a reading list in some public schools. The film is a great example of why both Freddie Bartholomew and Mickey Rooney were held in such esteem by the movie going public. MGM teamed them in a few films during these years, Captains Courageous and The Devil Is A Sissy also made good money for the coffers of Louis B. Mayer. One can still enjoy this film today.

    My sister and I just finished watching the movie again. It is one of our favorites. Not only do I give it a #10 rating - I also give a rating to infinity. I grew up on the 'edge' of earlier, more sane days of our country and world - at least the first few years were more sane, even though it was after WWII. I saw enough of the kind of family life that Cedric had with his Mom, and the love and kindness shown, to gratefully remember it. My Mom continued to show me and my siblings, and others, the same kind of love and caring that Ced's mother showed him and others, with such love, kindness, and gentleness, this present world knows little, if anything, about - and today's world is really missing a lot. All generations has it's good and bad sides, and good and bad people. The kind of morals and love which this movie showed, shows what the majority of society believed and lived, which made life more sane, not perfectly so, but more so. What today's world is missing out on.

    In 1880s Brooklyn, prissy Freddie Bartholomew (as Cedric "Ceddie" Erroll) celebrates his birthday by receiving a beautiful "highwheeler" from widowed mother Dolores Costello (as "Dearest" Erroll). When young Mr. Bartholomew takes the bicycle out for a ride, he is roughed-up by local bullies. But, Bartholomew fights back; and, he receives help from a swell pal, shoeshine boy Mickey Rooney (as Dick Tipton). Dusting themselves off, the lads listen to grocer Guy Kibbee (as Silas Hobbs) rail against "British aristocracy," after learning of their arrival in town. The British are coming, ironically, to take Bartholomew home to England. As it turns out, Ms. Costello's once denounced late husband fathered the only heir to the title "Little Lord Fauntleroy". And, Bartholomew must prepare to inherit grandfather C. Aubrey Smith's Earlship. In England, young Bartholomew (representing American idealism) clashes with gruff Earl Smith (representing British aristocracy). While that storyline reaches an obvious conclusion, there are others that make this film significantly more interesting than expected. Based on the classic story by (underrated) writer Frances Hodgson Burnett, it conveys some of the novel's nuances well, cleverly intertwining class, sex, and politics. In the 1930s, nobody could put a production together like David O. Selznick, and this is one of his best. As usual, they start with a perfectly cast lead. In one of his best parts, Bartholomew fits "Little Lord Fauntleroy" like a glove; he's even better "suited" to the role than was Mary Pickford (in 1921's version). Bartholomew was riding high after supporting Greta Garbo in Selznick's masterfully realized "Anna Karenina" (1935). Mr. Selznick liked to lure legends back before the camera, and succeeds with Ms. Costello; certainly, film-goers in 1936 couldn't help but be impressed with her billing - "Dolores" (a star on her own) "Costello" (as in Maurice) "Barrymore" (as in John) - the latter was used despite the fact that Dolores had recently divorced John Barrymore. Times change; nowadays, C. Aubrey Smith will raise more critics' bushy eyebrows. You also get Mr. Kibbee, providing seasoned counterpoint for the upper-crusted Mr. Smith, and similarly dignified Henry Stephenson (as Havisham). Kibbee's last words reveal the story's one real downer, but he handles the role expertly (and, you see the seeds of Bartholomew's likely post-pubescent rebellion). Watching old/young soul-mates Kibbee and Mr. Rooney perform together is a delight; and, Rooney is likewise marvelous. By the way, note director John Cromwell's simple, but stately, direction; smoothly tracking, he moves the story perfectly. Mr. Cromwell and the Selznick crew make the film into one of the era's better-looking productions. With photography by no less than Charles Rosher and music by Max Steiner, it's unfortunate this lost "Best Picture" received no award notices. If Selznick produced it at MGM, there'd have been nominations. The well-staged street scenes and beautiful sets are obviously highlights, with the opening sequences most impressive - but also noteworthy are simpler scenes. For example, later in the production, as Rooney and Kibbee shine each other's shoes, a singular paperboy is added to the background. Note the horse-drawn carriages, storefronts, and passersby throughout - this film is richly detailed, but never over-decorated. Taking a trip further down the credits, watch for great expressions from maid Una O'Connor (as Mary); the extraordinary Constance Collier (as Constanzia Lorridale), who inspired Joan Crawford and other legends; bratty Jackie Searl (as Tom Tipton), who gave Bartholomew a run for his money; lovable scene-enhancing Jessie Ralph (selling apples); and, listen for Helen Flint (as Minna Tipton) to exclaim, "What a hole!" ********* Little Lord Fauntleroy (4/2/36) John Cromwell ~ Freddie Bartholomew, Dolores Costello, Mickey Rooney, Guy Kibbee

    This film, although almost unbelievably dated, is a work of fine quality and utterly charming. It certainly is something special when it comes to the plot. This is the story of a little boy with a normal life who could have never imagined he was a heir of the title Earl of Dorincourt. Dutty calls this boy. Make no mistake: this is an endearing story. This fine-mannered curly-haired little lord captivates the Earl so much that the austere old man has a change of heart. He truly cares for this boy in a way he never though he could care about a child. Freddie Bartholomew's special acting as the Little Lord Fauntleroy is simply divine. Dolores Costello too is divine as "Dearest". As for C. Aubrey Smith, his acting as the old Earl is captivating. Mickey Rooney is hilarious as Dick Tipton. This should definitely be on Top 250.

    This film is like a little box of surprises. True, it looks and feels as aged as it is, but that's exactly this old-fashioned charm that makes it fun. The plot is an unexpected surprise in the positive sense. This plot is certainly original, unique and unusual, different from other films regardless of the era. The plot concerns a widowed mother and her son Ceddie living in America in the 1880's. Ceddie likes to call her "Dearest". That is another surprise. I've never seen a movie with someone calling their mother "Dearest" before. I find that quite cute. Ceddie seems popular where he lives, everybody likes him (except the bullies, of course) and he is very nice to everyone. Meanwhile, Ceddie's grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt, wants the boy to be brought to England to be his heir, as he has no more living sons. However, the Earl does not allow his mother to live in his castle. Ceddie gets devastated but "Dearest" does everything she can to convince him that the man is a very generous person, not touching on subjects that could be traumatic for the kid. The Earl, although reluctant at first, gets deeply impressed with the boy from the start. He, a bitter and cranky old man who always hated children, never thought he could be so fond of a child. Ceddie believes in the Earl's generosity so much that the stern old man really becomes generous. He couldn't have found a better heir. Ceddie is so delicate, so polite and has such aristocratic manners. This cute curly-haired boy has the face of an angel and the posture and manners of a little prince... or lord. He definitely conquers the old man's heart. They have a perfect chemistry from the very start. Even when an information that tells that Ceddie is not the real heir, the Earl is so proud of him that he doesn't want anyone else as his heir. He even gets to see the supposed real heir but dislikes him and thinks he is annoying. His wish is granted and he even allows Ceddie's mother to live in the castle in the ending. Freddie Bartholomew is noble as Ceddie, Dolores Costello is wonderful as "Dearest", C. Aubrey Smith has dignity as the Earl of Dorincourt and it's fun to see a very young Mickey Rooney as the bootblack and Ceddie's friend Dick Tipton. Mickey Rooney is like a comic relief, to which the actor's hilarious accent and charismatic acting contribute greatly. Guy Kibbee is fine as Mr. Hobbs... This precious little film should be properly restored to improve its slight audio flaws, as well as its many image scratches and "bounces", characteristic flaws in very old movies. Title in Portugal: 'O Pequeno Lorde'.

    "Little Lord Fauntleroy" is a tale about a lonely but extremely gruff old English Lord discovering that his estranged grandson in America is a wonderful child. It also includes the boy teaching the man humility and gentleness along the way. This is the third version of this story that I have seen and the second one I've seen recently. While I am sure there are other versions of this classic tale out there as well, I can't imagine any of them being better than this lovely 1936 version. Even with the ridiculous casting of the very English-sounding Freddie Bartholomew in the lead (he's supposed to be an American), the film is just wonderful. C. Aubry Smith is delightful as Bartholomew's gruff grandfather, but everyone else in the film also seemed so well-cast. This, combined with great sets, direction and the full David O. Selznick touch make this a terrific film for all ages. One not to be missed.

    The famous children's novel later made into a play is a vehicle that is perfectly suited for MGM's British born child star Freddie Bartholomew. Little Lord Fauntleroy can well be said to be his perfect role during his childhood years with Leo the Lion. Little Lord Fauntleroy was first published in 1885 and it concerns young Cedric Erroll who is living in Brooklyn in reduced circumstances with his mother due to the recent death of his father. Who as it turns out was the last surviving heir to an earldom back across the pond. Which brings Henry Stephenson over from the United Kingdom to tell Dolores Costello and her son Freddie Bartholomew that the young lad is now the new Earl to be of Dorrincourt once the old Earl, C. Aubrey Smith has passed on. Smith is one crusty old dude, but if you had lived as long as he had and seen all your sons predecease you, you might be bitter as well. And set in your ways and prejudices. One of the conditions is that Dolores Costello can come over as well, but she has to live separate and apart from her child as the Earl of Dorrincourt does not like those rebellious colonials and never forgave his son for marrying one. But cute and mannered young Freddie charms the old guy as only Freddie Bartholomew could back in those days and Smith warms up to the lad. However then another claimant comes on the horizon, Helen Flint says that she was the wife of an older deceased son and she's got a son by him played by Jackie Searl. Rounding out the principal players are Guy Kibbee who is the local grocer where Costello and Bartholomew live, in Brooklyn of all places and Mickey Rooney a pal from those mean streets who actually hold the key to the inheritance problem. Little Lord Fauntleroy was old fashioned even for 1936, it is set perfectly during the time of 1885. With the UK and USA going through two hot World Wars and one Cold War, the prejudices shown by Smith and Kibbee who starts out as a big Anglophobe despite liking Bartholomew are quaint to say the least. But the film does have a nostalgic charm about it though I daresay the play made from the original novel hasn't been too much revived. Probably the novel itself is still on a reading list in some public schools. The film is a great example of why both Freddie Bartholomew and Mickey Rooney were held in such esteem by the movie going public. MGM teamed them in a few films during these years, Captains Courageous and The Devil Is A Sissy also made good money for the coffers of Louis B. Mayer. One can still enjoy this film today.

    My sister and I just finished watching the movie again. It is one of our favorites. Not only do I give it a #10 rating - I also give a rating to infinity. I grew up on the 'edge' of earlier, more sane days of our country and world - at least the first few years were more sane, even though it was after WWII. I saw enough of the kind of family life that Cedric had with his Mom, and the love and kindness shown, to gratefully remember it. My Mom continued to show me and my siblings, and others, the same kind of love and caring that Ced's mother showed him and others, with such love, kindness, and gentleness, this present world knows little, if anything, about - and today's world is really missing a lot. All generations has it's good and bad sides, and good and bad people. The kind of morals and love which this movie showed, shows what the majority of society believed and lived, which made life more sane, not perfectly so, but more so. What today's world is missing out on.

    In 1880s Brooklyn, prissy Freddie Bartholomew (as Cedric "Ceddie" Erroll) celebrates his birthday by receiving a beautiful "highwheeler" from widowed mother Dolores Costello (as "Dearest" Erroll). When young Mr. Bartholomew takes the bicycle out for a ride, he is roughed-up by local bullies. But, Bartholomew fights back; and, he receives help from a swell pal, shoeshine boy Mickey Rooney (as Dick Tipton). Dusting themselves off, the lads listen to grocer Guy Kibbee (as Silas Hobbs) rail against "British aristocracy," after learning of their arrival in town. The British are coming, ironically, to take Bartholomew home to England. As it turns out, Ms. Costello's once denounced late husband fathered the only heir to the title "Little Lord Fauntleroy". And, Bartholomew must prepare to inherit grandfather C. Aubrey Smith's Earlship. In England, young Bartholomew (representing American idealism) clashes with gruff Earl Smith (representing British aristocracy). While that storyline reaches an obvious conclusion, there are others that make this film significantly more interesting than expected. Based on the classic story by (underrated) writer Frances Hodgson Burnett, it conveys some of the novel's nuances well, cleverly intertwining class, sex, and politics. In the 1930s, nobody could put a production together like David O. Selznick, and this is one of his best. As usual, they start with a perfectly cast lead. In one of his best parts, Bartholomew fits "Little Lord Fauntleroy" like a glove; he's even better "suited" to the role than was Mary Pickford (in 1921's version). Bartholomew was riding high after supporting Greta Garbo in Selznick's masterfully realized "Anna Karenina" (1935). Mr. Selznick liked to lure legends back before the camera, and succeeds with Ms. Costello; certainly, film-goers in 1936 couldn't help but be impressed with her billing - "Dolores" (a star on her own) "Costello" (as in Maurice) "Barrymore" (as in John) - the latter was used despite the fact that Dolores had recently divorced John Barrymore. Times change; nowadays, C. Aubrey Smith will raise more critics' bushy eyebrows. You also get Mr. Kibbee, providing seasoned counterpoint for the upper-crusted Mr. Smith, and similarly dignified Henry Stephenson (as Havisham). Kibbee's last words reveal the story's one real downer, but he handles the role expertly (and, you see the seeds of Bartholomew's likely post-pubescent rebellion). Watching old/young soul-mates Kibbee and Mr. Rooney perform together is a delight; and, Rooney is likewise marvelous. By the way, note director John Cromwell's simple, but stately, direction; smoothly tracking, he moves the story perfectly. Mr. Cromwell and the Selznick crew make the film into one of the era's better-looking productions. With photography by no less than Charles Rosher and music by Max Steiner, it's unfortunate this lost "Best Picture" received no award notices. If Selznick produced it at MGM, there'd have been nominations. The well-staged street scenes and beautiful sets are obviously highlights, with the opening sequences most impressive - but also noteworthy are simpler scenes. For example, later in the production, as Rooney and Kibbee shine each other's shoes, a singular paperboy is added to the background. Note the horse-drawn carriages, storefronts, and passersby throughout - this film is richly detailed, but never over-decorated. Taking a trip further down the credits, watch for great expressions from maid Una O'Connor (as Mary); the extraordinary Constance Collier (as Constanzia Lorridale), who inspired Joan Crawford and other legends; bratty Jackie Searl (as Tom Tipton), who gave Bartholomew a run for his money; lovable scene-enhancing Jessie Ralph (selling apples); and, listen for Helen Flint (as Minna Tipton) to exclaim, "What a hole!" ********* Little Lord Fauntleroy (4/2/36) John Cromwell ~ Freddie Bartholomew, Dolores Costello, Mickey Rooney, Guy Kibbee

    If you would like to watch the most humblest, kindest, generous child ever on screen, then this 1936 adaption of the classic " Little Lord Fauntleroy " is perfect for you. Freddie Bartholomew is absolutely irresistible as the impeccably polite Cedric, a role that seems tailored made just for him. C. Aubrey Smith's performance is strong and convincing, and even a little, scene stealing as the cantankerous grandfather, The Earl Of Dorincourt. Dolores Costello is lovely playing the gentle Dearest. Even the Lord's brusque Great Dane gives in to the charms of "Ceddie." Add Mickey Rooney, Guy Kibbee, along with a host of superb supporting actors all perfectly portraying their parts. The results are a first class, and outstanding film of a classic story. A very delightful and heartwarming picture, for all ages to enjoy. A must see for your list of early classic movies.

    Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936) Freddie Bartholomew, C. Aubrey Smith, Delores Costello, Guy Kibbee. Made from an 1880's novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, this is a loving, sweet story of a fatherless boy and his mother and how they come into their own. The grandfather is gruff and unforgiving of his son for marrying a foreigner and going off to America. But all is put right by the sweet grandson, who loves his father's "dearest" as he calls his mother. Called back to England to take his rightful place at the manor, little Lord Fauntleroy is the pride and joy of everyone on the estate in short order. A wonderful film to this day for all who have a heart and are willing to go along with a world of make believe. 8/10

    The book by Frances Hodgson Burnett was published in the 1880s and carried a simple message: humanitarianism is better than arrogance. This is William James' distinction between the tough minded and the tender minded. I must be one of the former because I found it a nonpareil of sentimental and inelegant pap. Pardon me while I light an expensive cigar and stomp the cat. Sheesh, how triumph follows tragedy and vice versa. Freddy Bartholomew is a nine-year-old boy living in genteel poverty with his loving mother ("Dearest") in a crummy neighborhood in Brooklyn. But not the real Brooklyn of the 1880s. This is a fairyland Brooklyn where there is no garbage or horse manure on the streets, and where Freddy's pal, Mickey Rooney, only betrays his lack of breeding by saying "erl" instead of "oil" and never busts Freddy in the snot locker. Freddy loves his pals, who include the greengrocer, and everybody loves Freddy, just as love loves to love love. I almost burst into sobs when a lawyer arrives from England and informs Freddy that, since he is the only surviving grandson of the Earl of Dorincourt, he's invited to come to England, join his grandfather in the family mansion, and be inculcated into the aristoi. The present Earl is a bilious and bushy old man who knows no pity except for himself. He hates Freddy's mother and she must live elsewhere, not in the mansion. He treats his tenant farmers the way they treat their dirt. Freddy, though, is a winsome little lad, naive and generous. To a fault, one might say. And before you know it, Freddy has the crotchety old curmudgeon learning how to be generous and kind -- in an old fashioned way, of course. He's not going to give the family silverware to the poor. He's just not going to berate the servants quite as much. Then tragedy strikes, and just when it seems things are going so well. Another woman shows up with a lollipop-sucking son who is older than Freddy, and SHE claims to be the first wife of the son of the current Earl. And, believe me, this babe is a real wasp. She laughs and taunts the white-haired old man who has grown to love Freddy, just as everyone else loves Freddy. Do things turn out all right? Is there a happy ending? Doesn't it prompt you to weep when you hear "Auld Lang Syne" played adagio? On a solo violin? Well, Freddy Bartholomew is unquestionably cute in appearance, speech, and demeanor although, to be sure, a little fist fight in the schoolyard might have done him a power of good. Actually, the illustrations in Hodgson's book started a sartorial fad and kids began to dress like Little Lord Fauntleroy in outfits that resembled little sailor suits with lace collars. The fad lasted for years. I believe there's a photo of young Ernest Hemingway floating around out there somewhere in the ether. The character of Little Lord Fauntleroy is winning, precisely because it's so improbable. The whole movie is as fantastic as The Wizard of Oz. C. Aubrey Smith is great as the grumbling old Earl, only reluctantly won over by his new grandson. Dolores Costello as "Dearest" always looks as if she's wearing a brave smile to keep from breaking into sobs of some sort, grief or gratitude -- it doesn't matter. Like so much sentimental material it has its charm. But that's about all it has, sentiment and charm. There's not a laugh in it, and there's no edginess to it. We know at once that the mistaken people will realize their errors, that the bad people will be punished or thwarted, and that the good people will be rewarded. A bit of edge might not have hurt. Have Freddy sneak a few puffs on a corn silk cigarette or something.

    Freddie Bartholomew, the little British lad with the face of an angel and a sweet disposition, is the title character in this classic David O. Selznick version of the famous story. He steals your heart as he plays wonderfully touching scenes with C. Aubrey Smith whereby his character charms the gruff old man and softens his heart forever. The plot has Smith resenting the lad because he thinks so little of the boy's mother, through a misunderstanding of her true character. All of these things are swept aside by the time the story reaches its conclusion, with boy, mother and grandfather all reunited for a happy ending. I have to say that C. Aubrey Smith, the venerable old actor who stole scenes in many a British film, is at his finest in this particular role. Using his bushy eyebrows and monocle for great effect, his expressions of anger, joy, surprise or stern contempt are beautifully executed. What an actor! I don't think he ever showed such range in any other of his memorable character roles. Never for a moment intimidated by his gruff grandfather, Freddie stands up to him in scene after scene, matching him for pure professionalism. He too delivers a standout performance as the polite but resolute lad who worships his loving mother (Dolores Costello) whom he calls "Dearest." Mickey Rooney and Guy Kibbe are excellent in good supporting roles. John Cromwell's detailed direction is superb for this charming, if old-fashioned tale played to perfection by Freddie Bartholomew and C. Aubrey Smith. Notice how Cromwell even fleshes out background scenes with a single paper boy working hard to attract buyers while adding reality to a street scene focused on two other characters in the forefront.

And, Bartholomew must prepare to inherit grandfather C. Aubrey Smith's Earlship. In England, young Bartholomew (representing American idealism) clashes with gruff Earl Smith (representing British aristocracy). While that storyline reaches an obvious conclusion, there are others that make this film significantly more interesting than expected. Based on the classic story by (underrated) writer Frances Hodgson Burnett, it conveys some of the novel's nuances well, cleverly intertwining class, sex, and politics. In the 1930s, nobody could put a production together like David O. Selznick, and this is one of his best. As usual, they start with a perfectly cast lead. In one of his best parts, Bartholomew fits "Little Lord Fauntleroy" like a glove; he's even better "suited" to the role than was Mary Pickford (in 1921's version). Bartholomew was riding high after supporting Greta Garbo in Selznick's masterfully realized "Anna Karenina" (1935). Mr. Selznick liked to lure legends back before the camera, and succeeds with Ms. Costello; certainly, film-goers in 1936 couldn't help but be impressed with her billing - "Dolores" (a star on her own) "Costello" (as in Maurice) "Barrymore" (as in John) - the latter was used despite the fact that Dolores had recently divorced John Barrymore. Times change; nowadays, C. Aubrey Smith will raise more critics' bushy eyebrows. You also get Mr. Kibbee, providing seasoned counterpoint for the upper-crusted Mr. Smith, and similarly dignified Henry Stephenson (as Havisham). Kibbee's last words reveal the story's one real downer, but he handles the role expertly (and, you see the seeds of Bartholomew's likely post-pubescent rebellion). Watching old/young soul-mates Kibbee and Mr. Rooney perform together is a delight; and, Rooney is likewise marvelous. By the way, note director John Cromwell's simple, but stately, direction; smoothly tracking, he moves the story perfectly. Mr. Cromwell and the Selznick crew make the film into one of the era's better-looking productions. With photography by no less than Charles Rosher and music by Max Steiner, it's unfortunate this lost "Best Picture" received no award notices. If Selznick produced it at MGM, there'd have been nominations. The well-staged street scenes and beautiful sets are obviously highlights, with the opening sequences most impressive - but also noteworthy are simpler scenes. For example, later in the production, as Rooney and Kibbee shine each other's shoes, a singular paperboy is added to the background. Note the horse-drawn carriages, storefronts, and passersby throughout - this film is richly detailed, but never over-decorated. Taking a trip further down the credits, watch for great expressions from maid Una O'Connor (as Mary); the extraordinary Constance Collier (as Constanzia Lorridale), who inspired Joan Crawford and other legends; bratty Jackie Searl (as Tom Tipton), who gave Bartholomew a run for his money; lovable scene-enhancing Jessie Ralph (selling apples); and, listen for Helen Flint (as Minna Tipton) to exclaim, "What a hole!" ********* Little Lord Fauntleroy (4/2/36) John Cromwell ~ Freddie Bartholomew, Dolores Costello, Mickey Rooney, Guy Kibbee
