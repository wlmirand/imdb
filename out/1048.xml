 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  How do siblings deal with each other in their targets? This is the question tackled in this movie. Blue-collared Mickey drives a New York taxicab since the breakup with his promiscuous ex-fianc&eacute;e Heather two years ago. His younger, white-collared brother, Francis, cannot let Mickey forget the tragedy of the "hairy ass": (Mickey's image of his apartment floor of the guy having sex with Heather after walking in on them). Finding relief in driving his cab, Mickey meets an art student named Hope whom he marries after knowing her for only 24 hours. Mickey also meets his old lover Heather, and learns more about life itself as taxi fares in the course of a summer. Francis, a young Wall Street corporate raider, unhappy in his marriage to Renee and led by his infidelity, continues his shots at Mickey throughout the film, only to find himself a plot device that lends humor and lessons about marriage and brotherhood when he meets and starts an dangerous affair with Heather, despite Mickey's ...

    Good job burying Aniston in the script, because she won't amount to much, and OD'ing us on whatever else is left. Not one genuinely funny moment. Too malicious for romance. Too lost for drama. I'll leave it as 90's puffery. The chemistry between Mickey and Hope, the couple we're suppose to cheer for, was non-existent. The brotherly relationship between Mickey and Francis was undercut, well... by the acting. Besides Aniston, the very little of her, this film provides nothing that works. What was this film trying to portray, what was the message, what was the point? Answer: its Sex In The City meets Friends minus the talent, the writing and the humor.

    Edward Burns wrote and directed this bittersweet romantic comedy that has some sharp lines and a brisk pace, but whose characters resemble real people only in the fact that they have two eyes and a nose, etc. People in this movie do irrational things which are casually accepted by those around them as if the things they've done are everyday occurrences. The cast is an attractive one and they all give decent performances, even if some - such as Cameron Diaz's slutty businesswoman - are under-written. The outcome of all this preoccupation with sex and relationships is pretty obvious from the outset, but the sometimes witty lines ('let me get this straight,' asks an incredulous John Mahoney of his philandering son (Mike McGlone), 'You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?') keep things bubbling nicely. It won't stay in your memory for long, but it won't disturb you while it's in there.

    All around bad movie. I start it with that, so people who have their hopes up for a good review can just read that and know that this movie sucked! The only reason why it got anything close to a decent rating was because of Jennifer Anistonshe was funny, adorable, and charming in her role. The writer, Edward Burnsmay think of getting himself a different job. I mean, I've seen some of the movies he's written, directed, and acted inand they have (for the most part) all sucked! Now, when he is just acting in a movie (like the movie 27 Dresses), he is actually good. Maybe he needs to spend a little more time with his workor maybe he should just stick with acting and leave writing and directing alone for a while.

    Dry as a bone relationships comedy ends up being too parched to produce the humour needed. Heavily reliant on good performances, the cast (including Ed Burns, Mike McGlone, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Anniston, Maxine Bahns and John Mahoney) do well, but there are no standouts. Writer-director Burns is unfortunately unable to endear us to any of his characters in "She's the One", so you won't care who ends up with whom. Super cool, trendy yet uninspiring 90's fare.

    I didn't really know anything about this going in. That includes the fact that Burns had directed or done a script. He's pretty good, I'd give another one of his a chance. The plot is interesting and develops nicely throughout. This has quite fast pace, and at no point does it really seem to slow down, without being overwhelming in speed. The acting is marvelous, everyone hands in a solid performance. Dialog is clever and well-delivered. All of the writing is rather well-done, the story, the characters, etc. The parts are well-cast, they are all credible. This is very funny, and it doesn't particularly try too hard at getting laughs. Almost all of the humor lies in the snappy lines and exchanges. No one in this feels flat or overly perfect, they are all flawed in some way, and thus much easier to relate to. This is a nice, not too cutesy or predictable romantic comedy, with a little more of an attitude, without completely ceasing to fall into that genre. The language is relatively frequent, and definitely moderate to strong. Sexuality is mainly hinted at or mentioned, not seen. I recommend this to fans of those involved in making it. 7/10

    This is, as the summary says, one of my favorite comedies, despite the flaws pointed out by others. The reason is that it works as a metaphor for life better than it does as a literal story--parts of it are a stretch. But I think it is a wonderful comedy with some great things to say about relationships and life. A big part of why I like it is the writing, which strikes me as natural, believable, and unforced--which is certainly aided by the acting performances. Some of the lines are simply hilarious: "You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?" Or "That's an interesting theory. I hope you didn't hurt yourself coming up with that one," just to pick two. I also mostly like the acting performances. Burns and McGlone play off each other very well, and if McGlone's character can seem a bit over the top, I think that's a directorial choice to help make the point. And for those people who don't care for Maxine Bahns, I think she's better than she is given credit for. She has some moments that are just terrific, like when she first pops over the front seat of the cab and introduces herself with the story of her friend under the sink. This was the performance that convinced me that Jennifer Aniston really can act well--the scene where McGlone says he wants a divorce is wonderfully played by her-- that mix of anger and hurt and shock are portrayed beautifully. And John Mahoney is great, as is Cameron Diaz. The structural parallels are also terrific, as they illustrate the differences in the two couples. Shopping in a thrift shop as opposed to an upscale boutique, the contrast in apartments, etc., are all great devices to illustrate and underline the differences between the two brothers and couples. And using McGlone's driver as a kind of chorus worked very well, at least for me. In conclusion, this film is a ton of fun, and conveys meaning beyond what one would expect from a romantic comedy (if I have to categorize it). Is it flawed? Of course. But for me, this is a film that transcends its flaws and works on a number of levels, both literal and figurative. I highly recommend it.

    While I can't say there's any real moral compass to the storyline (with everyone cheating on everyone else), if nothing else EDWARD BURNS can consider himself a Long Island Woody Allen--because the story told in brief vignettes is exactly the sort of tale that Allen likes to spin about ditsy relationships and dysfunctional human beings. It may lack the more subtle wit and dry humor found in some of Allen's works, but it's safe to say that if this had been penned by Allen Hollywood would be jumping all over it with awards. As it is, EDWARD BURNS as the older brother--a cabbie aptly described by another as probably the only English-speaking cab driver in the city of NY--is excellent, even if some of his motivations aren't crystal clear, like the casual decision to go to Paris with his girlfriend when both of them are clearly broke. MIKE McGLONE is fine as his financially solvent but mentally challenged brother who works on Wall Street but is hopelessly in love with a trashy blonde, CAMERON DIAZ, in another one of her bubble-gum roles. None of it rises above the level of a good TV script and the language is pretty salty throughout, dealing as it does with SEX almost exclusively. But Burns directs it at a good pace and it moves briskly to a satisfying conclusion which finds him reunited with his girlfriend after a series of misunderstandings. A pleasant way to spend an hour-and-a-half but don't expect anything great. Burns and McGlone were much better in THE BROTHERS McMULLEN the previous year.

    The movie is kind of a one-two punch about relationships and the responsibilities of men within the relationships. It does a fantastic job outlining and fleshing out the female characters. As such, Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston's characters are probably some of the better written and most believable characters in the movie. (In fact, Cameron Diaz stole the show) You really do feel for some of the female casts. This, however, does not mean it gets a free pass with it's less than stellar characters... Maxine Bahns was... mediocre at best. But the rest of the male characters come across more like caricatures then real people. Mike McGlone is basically what happens if you take every alpha male stereotype, roll it through some dirt, and mix it together. I'd like to say that it's a good concept, but he comes across as just too unbelievable to me. The same can be said about John Mahoney's character, who while not as much of a caricature, can basically be summed with "chauvinistic conservative patriarch who ends up screwing up their son's lives". The only person that is even remotely likable, being Edward Burns character is a little unbelievable at times too. I think the only good moments that Ed Burns has are from the scenes where he's with Cameron Diaz. And in the end, these characters are not written to be people, they were written to be ideas and archetypes to be used for commentary. However, having said that, some of the dialogue is pretty entertaining and some of the repartee between the characters are fun to listen to. The thing is though, funny dialogue doesn't give character depth. Not bad as far as a romantic comedy goes, but definitely not home run movie.

    What's to say about a film in which Cameron Diaz is one of the better actors? The unexceptional young cast varies from okay-ish to really bad, and the script isn't much better. Aniston tries hard but she is utterly talent-free, McGlone is simply awful, Burns's girlfriend is stiff and boring, and only the director Burns seems to have a little bit of charisma to be able to play in a film like this; however, he isn't much of a director (or writer). The film tries hard to be one of those clever, sophisticated, modern relationshit comedies but comes off as lame and pretty stupid (and rather unfunny). The humour and the dialog are strictly your average TV sitcom material, except that there is no laughing track to save the jokes; and this is no "Seinfeld" - it's more like "Murphy Brown" or "Friends" or some other nit-witty, pathetic show. The dialog is forced. I haven't laughed once during the film. The bubble-gum characterization also doesn't help. Many of the relationshits in the film don't make sense, and the film as a whole is just unconvincing; the acting, the dialog, the plot, the characters - practically everything. A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face? Or was it because he picked up a TV set from his long-gone ex-fianc&eacute;e? The viewer is actually required to accept this nonsense. Absurd. And what about Burns's wife flying to Paris? Where the hell did she find the money for a ticket to Europe if she is so goddamn broke? (Or maybe I forgot what it means to be broke for an American: having "only" one car and eating out "only" six times a week.) But never-mind this little detail; it is not one of the reasons this film is so mediocre. It all comes down to the fact that too little talent has joined together to make a movie. It seems that in the 90s any Joe Shmoe can make a movie and be hailed as a writer-director-actor prodigy. If you want to read my parody/satire bio of Cameron Diaz (and other Hollywood morons), contact me by e-mail.

    I am a fan of Edward Burns' movies. For the most part I thought "She's the One" was an enjoyable film. However, there was some definite ups and downs: Ups: Characters and Acting. I really liked the characters in this film Hands down, my favorite was John Mahoney as the father. He was superb has an uber-Catholic Irish hard ass father with a soft spot for his boys. Maxine Bahns was absolutely beautiful and lovable in this film as well. I also really liked the brother relationship between Edward Burns and Mike McGlone. I also have a brother that is close an age and Burns did a really great job capturing the competitive nature between siblings. Downs: Triteness. I could not watch this movie at some parts because of how cheesy some of them were. Burns did nothing to set "She the One" apart from every other 90's coming-of-age relationship film. While I thought there was some good dialogue, it could not save the film from becoming just another typical 90's dramatic comedy about relationships. Although I did enjoy this movie and always put it on whenever it I see it on HBO, this is not Edward Burns' best film. Go see Brothers McMullen, Sidewalks of New York, and the Groomsmen for better Edward Burns films. And if you have some free time..."She's the One" will do OK.

A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face? Or was it because he picked up a TV set from his long-gone ex-fianc&eacute;e? The viewer is actually required to accept this nonsense. Absurd. And what about Burns's wife flying to Paris? Where the hell did she find the money for a ticket to Europe if she is so goddamn broke? (Or maybe I forgot what it means to be broke for an American: having "only" one car and eating out "only" six times a week.) But never-mind this little detail; it is not one of the reasons this film is so mediocre. It all comes down to the fact that too little talent has joined together to make a movie. It seems that in the 90s any Joe Shmoe can make a movie and be hailed as a writer-director-actor prodigy.

    I am a fan of Edward Burns' movies. For the most part I thought "She's the One" was an enjoyable film. However, there was some definite ups and downs: Ups: Characters and Acting. I really liked the characters in this film Hands down, my favorite was John Mahoney as the father. He was superb has an uber-Catholic Irish hard ass father with a soft spot for his boys. Maxine Bahns was absolutely beautiful and lovable in this film as well. I also really liked the brother relationship between Edward Burns and Mike McGlone. I also have a brother that is close an age and Burns did a really great job capturing the competitive nature between siblings. Downs: Triteness. I could not watch this movie at some parts because of how cheesy some of them were. Burns did nothing to set "She the One" apart from every other 90's coming-of-age relationship film. While I thought there was some good dialogue, it could not save the film from becoming just another typical 90's dramatic comedy about relationships. Although I did enjoy this movie and always put it on whenever it I see it on HBO, this is not Edward Burns' best film. Go see Brothers McMullen, Sidewalks of New York, and the Groomsmen for better Edward Burns films. And if you have some free time..."She's the One" will do OK.

    Good job burying Aniston in the script, because she won't amount to much, and OD'ing us on whatever else is left. Not one genuinely funny moment. Too malicious for romance. Too lost for drama. I'll leave it as 90's puffery. The chemistry between Mickey and Hope, the couple we're suppose to cheer for, was non-existent. The brotherly relationship between Mickey and Francis was undercut, well... by the acting. Besides Aniston, the very little of her, this film provides nothing that works. What was this film trying to portray, what was the message, what was the point? Answer: its Sex In The City meets Friends minus the talent, the writing and the humor.

    Edward Burns wrote and directed this bittersweet romantic comedy that has some sharp lines and a brisk pace, but whose characters resemble real people only in the fact that they have two eyes and a nose, etc. People in this movie do irrational things which are casually accepted by those around them as if the things they've done are everyday occurrences. The cast is an attractive one and they all give decent performances, even if some - such as Cameron Diaz's slutty businesswoman - are under-written. The outcome of all this preoccupation with sex and relationships is pretty obvious from the outset, but the sometimes witty lines ('let me get this straight,' asks an incredulous John Mahoney of his philandering son (Mike McGlone), 'You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?') keep things bubbling nicely. It won't stay in your memory for long, but it won't disturb you while it's in there.

    All around bad movie. I start it with that, so people who have their hopes up for a good review can just read that and know that this movie sucked! The only reason why it got anything close to a decent rating was because of Jennifer Anistonshe was funny, adorable, and charming in her role. The writer, Edward Burnsmay think of getting himself a different job. I mean, I've seen some of the movies he's written, directed, and acted inand they have (for the most part) all sucked! Now, when he is just acting in a movie (like the movie 27 Dresses), he is actually good. Maybe he needs to spend a little more time with his workor maybe he should just stick with acting and leave writing and directing alone for a while.

    Dry as a bone relationships comedy ends up being too parched to produce the humour needed. Heavily reliant on good performances, the cast (including Ed Burns, Mike McGlone, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Anniston, Maxine Bahns and John Mahoney) do well, but there are no standouts. Writer-director Burns is unfortunately unable to endear us to any of his characters in "She's the One", so you won't care who ends up with whom. Super cool, trendy yet uninspiring 90's fare.

    I didn't really know anything about this going in. That includes the fact that Burns had directed or done a script. He's pretty good, I'd give another one of his a chance. The plot is interesting and develops nicely throughout. This has quite fast pace, and at no point does it really seem to slow down, without being overwhelming in speed. The acting is marvelous, everyone hands in a solid performance. Dialog is clever and well-delivered. All of the writing is rather well-done, the story, the characters, etc. The parts are well-cast, they are all credible. This is very funny, and it doesn't particularly try too hard at getting laughs. Almost all of the humor lies in the snappy lines and exchanges. No one in this feels flat or overly perfect, they are all flawed in some way, and thus much easier to relate to. This is a nice, not too cutesy or predictable romantic comedy, with a little more of an attitude, without completely ceasing to fall into that genre. The language is relatively frequent, and definitely moderate to strong. Sexuality is mainly hinted at or mentioned, not seen. I recommend this to fans of those involved in making it. 7/10

    This is, as the summary says, one of my favorite comedies, despite the flaws pointed out by others. The reason is that it works as a metaphor for life better than it does as a literal story--parts of it are a stretch. But I think it is a wonderful comedy with some great things to say about relationships and life. A big part of why I like it is the writing, which strikes me as natural, believable, and unforced--which is certainly aided by the acting performances. Some of the lines are simply hilarious: "You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?" Or "That's an interesting theory. I hope you didn't hurt yourself coming up with that one," just to pick two. I also mostly like the acting performances. Burns and McGlone play off each other very well, and if McGlone's character can seem a bit over the top, I think that's a directorial choice to help make the point. And for those people who don't care for Maxine Bahns, I think she's better than she is given credit for. She has some moments that are just terrific, like when she first pops over the front seat of the cab and introduces herself with the story of her friend under the sink. This was the performance that convinced me that Jennifer Aniston really can act well--the scene where McGlone says he wants a divorce is wonderfully played by her-- that mix of anger and hurt and shock are portrayed beautifully. And John Mahoney is great, as is Cameron Diaz. The structural parallels are also terrific, as they illustrate the differences in the two couples. Shopping in a thrift shop as opposed to an upscale boutique, the contrast in apartments, etc., are all great devices to illustrate and underline the differences between the two brothers and couples. And using McGlone's driver as a kind of chorus worked very well, at least for me. In conclusion, this film is a ton of fun, and conveys meaning beyond what one would expect from a romantic comedy (if I have to categorize it). Is it flawed? Of course. But for me, this is a film that transcends its flaws and works on a number of levels, both literal and figurative. I highly recommend it.

    While I can't say there's any real moral compass to the storyline (with everyone cheating on everyone else), if nothing else EDWARD BURNS can consider himself a Long Island Woody Allen--because the story told in brief vignettes is exactly the sort of tale that Allen likes to spin about ditsy relationships and dysfunctional human beings. It may lack the more subtle wit and dry humor found in some of Allen's works, but it's safe to say that if this had been penned by Allen Hollywood would be jumping all over it with awards. As it is, EDWARD BURNS as the older brother--a cabbie aptly described by another as probably the only English-speaking cab driver in the city of NY--is excellent, even if some of his motivations aren't crystal clear, like the casual decision to go to Paris with his girlfriend when both of them are clearly broke. MIKE McGLONE is fine as his financially solvent but mentally challenged brother who works on Wall Street but is hopelessly in love with a trashy blonde, CAMERON DIAZ, in another one of her bubble-gum roles. None of it rises above the level of a good TV script and the language is pretty salty throughout, dealing as it does with SEX almost exclusively. But Burns directs it at a good pace and it moves briskly to a satisfying conclusion which finds him reunited with his girlfriend after a series of misunderstandings. A pleasant way to spend an hour-and-a-half but don't expect anything great. Burns and McGlone were much better in THE BROTHERS McMULLEN the previous year.

    The movie is kind of a one-two punch about relationships and the responsibilities of men within the relationships. It does a fantastic job outlining and fleshing out the female characters. As such, Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston's characters are probably some of the better written and most believable characters in the movie. (In fact, Cameron Diaz stole the show) You really do feel for some of the female casts. This, however, does not mean it gets a free pass with it's less than stellar characters... Maxine Bahns was... mediocre at best. But the rest of the male characters come across more like caricatures then real people. Mike McGlone is basically what happens if you take every alpha male stereotype, roll it through some dirt, and mix it together. I'd like to say that it's a good concept, but he comes across as just too unbelievable to me. The same can be said about John Mahoney's character, who while not as much of a caricature, can basically be summed with "chauvinistic conservative patriarch who ends up screwing up their son's lives". The only person that is even remotely likable, being Edward Burns character is a little unbelievable at times too. I think the only good moments that Ed Burns has are from the scenes where he's with Cameron Diaz. And in the end, these characters are not written to be people, they were written to be ideas and archetypes to be used for commentary. However, having said that, some of the dialogue is pretty entertaining and some of the repartee between the characters are fun to listen to. The thing is though, funny dialogue doesn't give character depth. Not bad as far as a romantic comedy goes, but definitely not home run movie.

    What's to say about a film in which Cameron Diaz is one of the better actors? The unexceptional young cast varies from okay-ish to really bad, and the script isn't much better. Aniston tries hard but she is utterly talent-free, McGlone is simply awful, Burns's girlfriend is stiff and boring, and only the director Burns seems to have a little bit of charisma to be able to play in a film like this; however, he isn't much of a director (or writer). The film tries hard to be one of those clever, sophisticated, modern relationshit comedies but comes off as lame and pretty stupid (and rather unfunny). The humour and the dialog are strictly your average TV sitcom material, except that there is no laughing track to save the jokes; and this is no "Seinfeld" - it's more like "Murphy Brown" or "Friends" or some other nit-witty, pathetic show. The dialog is forced. I haven't laughed once during the film. The bubble-gum characterization also doesn't help. Many of the relationshits in the film don't make sense, and the film as a whole is just unconvincing; the acting, the dialog, the plot, the characters - practically everything. A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face?

A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face? Or was it because he picked up a TV set from his long-gone ex-fianc&eacute;e? The viewer is actually required to accept this nonsense. Absurd. And what about Burns's wife flying to Paris? Where the hell did she find the money for a ticket to Europe if she is so goddamn broke? (Or maybe I forgot what it means to be broke for an American: having "only" one car and eating out "only" six times a week.) But never-mind this little detail; it is not one of the reasons this film is so mediocre. It all comes down to the fact that too little talent has joined together to make a movie. It seems that in the 90s any Joe Shmoe can make a movie and be hailed as a writer-director-actor prodigy.

    I am a fan of Edward Burns' movies. For the most part I thought "She's the One" was an enjoyable film. However, there was some definite ups and downs: Ups: Characters and Acting. I really liked the characters in this film Hands down, my favorite was John Mahoney as the father. He was superb has an uber-Catholic Irish hard ass father with a soft spot for his boys. Maxine Bahns was absolutely beautiful and lovable in this film as well. I also really liked the brother relationship between Edward Burns and Mike McGlone. I also have a brother that is close an age and Burns did a really great job capturing the competitive nature between siblings. Downs: Triteness. I could not watch this movie at some parts because of how cheesy some of them were. Burns did nothing to set "She the One" apart from every other 90's coming-of-age relationship film. While I thought there was some good dialogue, it could not save the film from becoming just another typical 90's dramatic comedy about relationships. Although I did enjoy this movie and always put it on whenever it I see it on HBO, this is not Edward Burns' best film. Go see Brothers McMullen, Sidewalks of New York, and the Groomsmen for better Edward Burns films. And if you have some free time..."She's the One" will do OK.

    Good job burying Aniston in the script, because she won't amount to much, and OD'ing us on whatever else is left. Not one genuinely funny moment. Too malicious for romance. Too lost for drama. I'll leave it as 90's puffery. The chemistry between Mickey and Hope, the couple we're suppose to cheer for, was non-existent. The brotherly relationship between Mickey and Francis was undercut, well... by the acting. Besides Aniston, the very little of her, this film provides nothing that works. What was this film trying to portray, what was the message, what was the point? Answer: its Sex In The City meets Friends minus the talent, the writing and the humor.

    Edward Burns wrote and directed this bittersweet romantic comedy that has some sharp lines and a brisk pace, but whose characters resemble real people only in the fact that they have two eyes and a nose, etc. People in this movie do irrational things which are casually accepted by those around them as if the things they've done are everyday occurrences. The cast is an attractive one and they all give decent performances, even if some - such as Cameron Diaz's slutty businesswoman - are under-written. The outcome of all this preoccupation with sex and relationships is pretty obvious from the outset, but the sometimes witty lines ('let me get this straight,' asks an incredulous John Mahoney of his philandering son (Mike McGlone), 'You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?') keep things bubbling nicely. It won't stay in your memory for long, but it won't disturb you while it's in there.

    All around bad movie. I start it with that, so people who have their hopes up for a good review can just read that and know that this movie sucked! The only reason why it got anything close to a decent rating was because of Jennifer Anistonshe was funny, adorable, and charming in her role. The writer, Edward Burnsmay think of getting himself a different job. I mean, I've seen some of the movies he's written, directed, and acted inand they have (for the most part) all sucked! Now, when he is just acting in a movie (like the movie 27 Dresses), he is actually good. Maybe he needs to spend a little more time with his workor maybe he should just stick with acting and leave writing and directing alone for a while.

    Dry as a bone relationships comedy ends up being too parched to produce the humour needed. Heavily reliant on good performances, the cast (including Ed Burns, Mike McGlone, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Anniston, Maxine Bahns and John Mahoney) do well, but there are no standouts. Writer-director Burns is unfortunately unable to endear us to any of his characters in "She's the One", so you won't care who ends up with whom. Super cool, trendy yet uninspiring 90's fare.

    I didn't really know anything about this going in. That includes the fact that Burns had directed or done a script. He's pretty good, I'd give another one of his a chance. The plot is interesting and develops nicely throughout. This has quite fast pace, and at no point does it really seem to slow down, without being overwhelming in speed. The acting is marvelous, everyone hands in a solid performance. Dialog is clever and well-delivered. All of the writing is rather well-done, the story, the characters, etc. The parts are well-cast, they are all credible. This is very funny, and it doesn't particularly try too hard at getting laughs. Almost all of the humor lies in the snappy lines and exchanges. No one in this feels flat or overly perfect, they are all flawed in some way, and thus much easier to relate to. This is a nice, not too cutesy or predictable romantic comedy, with a little more of an attitude, without completely ceasing to fall into that genre. The language is relatively frequent, and definitely moderate to strong. Sexuality is mainly hinted at or mentioned, not seen. I recommend this to fans of those involved in making it. 7/10

    This is, as the summary says, one of my favorite comedies, despite the flaws pointed out by others. The reason is that it works as a metaphor for life better than it does as a literal story--parts of it are a stretch. But I think it is a wonderful comedy with some great things to say about relationships and life. A big part of why I like it is the writing, which strikes me as natural, believable, and unforced--which is certainly aided by the acting performances. Some of the lines are simply hilarious: "You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?" Or "That's an interesting theory. I hope you didn't hurt yourself coming up with that one," just to pick two. I also mostly like the acting performances. Burns and McGlone play off each other very well, and if McGlone's character can seem a bit over the top, I think that's a directorial choice to help make the point. And for those people who don't care for Maxine Bahns, I think she's better than she is given credit for. She has some moments that are just terrific, like when she first pops over the front seat of the cab and introduces herself with the story of her friend under the sink. This was the performance that convinced me that Jennifer Aniston really can act well--the scene where McGlone says he wants a divorce is wonderfully played by her-- that mix of anger and hurt and shock are portrayed beautifully. And John Mahoney is great, as is Cameron Diaz. The structural parallels are also terrific, as they illustrate the differences in the two couples. Shopping in a thrift shop as opposed to an upscale boutique, the contrast in apartments, etc., are all great devices to illustrate and underline the differences between the two brothers and couples. And using McGlone's driver as a kind of chorus worked very well, at least for me. In conclusion, this film is a ton of fun, and conveys meaning beyond what one would expect from a romantic comedy (if I have to categorize it). Is it flawed? Of course. But for me, this is a film that transcends its flaws and works on a number of levels, both literal and figurative. I highly recommend it.

    While I can't say there's any real moral compass to the storyline (with everyone cheating on everyone else), if nothing else EDWARD BURNS can consider himself a Long Island Woody Allen--because the story told in brief vignettes is exactly the sort of tale that Allen likes to spin about ditsy relationships and dysfunctional human beings. It may lack the more subtle wit and dry humor found in some of Allen's works, but it's safe to say that if this had been penned by Allen Hollywood would be jumping all over it with awards. As it is, EDWARD BURNS as the older brother--a cabbie aptly described by another as probably the only English-speaking cab driver in the city of NY--is excellent, even if some of his motivations aren't crystal clear, like the casual decision to go to Paris with his girlfriend when both of them are clearly broke. MIKE McGLONE is fine as his financially solvent but mentally challenged brother who works on Wall Street but is hopelessly in love with a trashy blonde, CAMERON DIAZ, in another one of her bubble-gum roles. None of it rises above the level of a good TV script and the language is pretty salty throughout, dealing as it does with SEX almost exclusively. But Burns directs it at a good pace and it moves briskly to a satisfying conclusion which finds him reunited with his girlfriend after a series of misunderstandings. A pleasant way to spend an hour-and-a-half but don't expect anything great. Burns and McGlone were much better in THE BROTHERS McMULLEN the previous year.

    The movie is kind of a one-two punch about relationships and the responsibilities of men within the relationships. It does a fantastic job outlining and fleshing out the female characters. As such, Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston's characters are probably some of the better written and most believable characters in the movie. (In fact, Cameron Diaz stole the show) You really do feel for some of the female casts. This, however, does not mean it gets a free pass with it's less than stellar characters... Maxine Bahns was... mediocre at best. But the rest of the male characters come across more like caricatures then real people. Mike McGlone is basically what happens if you take every alpha male stereotype, roll it through some dirt, and mix it together. I'd like to say that it's a good concept, but he comes across as just too unbelievable to me. The same can be said about John Mahoney's character, who while not as much of a caricature, can basically be summed with "chauvinistic conservative patriarch who ends up screwing up their son's lives". The only person that is even remotely likable, being Edward Burns character is a little unbelievable at times too. I think the only good moments that Ed Burns has are from the scenes where he's with Cameron Diaz. And in the end, these characters are not written to be people, they were written to be ideas and archetypes to be used for commentary. However, having said that, some of the dialogue is pretty entertaining and some of the repartee between the characters are fun to listen to. The thing is though, funny dialogue doesn't give character depth. Not bad as far as a romantic comedy goes, but definitely not home run movie.

    What's to say about a film in which Cameron Diaz is one of the better actors? The unexceptional young cast varies from okay-ish to really bad, and the script isn't much better. Aniston tries hard but she is utterly talent-free, McGlone is simply awful, Burns's girlfriend is stiff and boring, and only the director Burns seems to have a little bit of charisma to be able to play in a film like this; however, he isn't much of a director (or writer). The film tries hard to be one of those clever, sophisticated, modern relationshit comedies but comes off as lame and pretty stupid (and rather unfunny). The humour and the dialog are strictly your average TV sitcom material, except that there is no laughing track to save the jokes; and this is no "Seinfeld" - it's more like "Murphy Brown" or "Friends" or some other nit-witty, pathetic show. The dialog is forced. I haven't laughed once during the film. The bubble-gum characterization also doesn't help. Many of the relationshits in the film don't make sense, and the film as a whole is just unconvincing; the acting, the dialog, the plot, the characters - practically everything. A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face?

A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face? Or was it because he picked up a TV set from his long-gone ex-fianc&eacute;e? The viewer is actually required to accept this nonsense. Absurd. And what about Burns's wife flying to Paris? Where the hell did she find the money for a ticket to Europe if she is so goddamn broke? (Or maybe I forgot what it means to be broke for an American: having "only" one car and eating out "only" six times a week.) But never-mind this little detail; it is not one of the reasons this film is so mediocre. It all comes down to the fact that too little talent has joined together to make a movie. It seems that in the 90s any Joe Shmoe can make a movie and be hailed as a writer-director-actor prodigy.

    I am a fan of Edward Burns' movies. For the most part I thought "She's the One" was an enjoyable film. However, there was some definite ups and downs: Ups: Characters and Acting. I really liked the characters in this film Hands down, my favorite was John Mahoney as the father. He was superb has an uber-Catholic Irish hard ass father with a soft spot for his boys. Maxine Bahns was absolutely beautiful and lovable in this film as well. I also really liked the brother relationship between Edward Burns and Mike McGlone. I also have a brother that is close an age and Burns did a really great job capturing the competitive nature between siblings. Downs: Triteness. I could not watch this movie at some parts because of how cheesy some of them were. Burns did nothing to set "She the One" apart from every other 90's coming-of-age relationship film. While I thought there was some good dialogue, it could not save the film from becoming just another typical 90's dramatic comedy about relationships. Although I did enjoy this movie and always put it on whenever it I see it on HBO, this is not Edward Burns' best film. Go see Brothers McMullen, Sidewalks of New York, and the Groomsmen for better Edward Burns films. And if you have some free time..."She's the One" will do OK.

    Good job burying Aniston in the script, because she won't amount to much, and OD'ing us on whatever else is left. Not one genuinely funny moment. Too malicious for romance. Too lost for drama. I'll leave it as 90's puffery. The chemistry between Mickey and Hope, the couple we're suppose to cheer for, was non-existent. The brotherly relationship between Mickey and Francis was undercut, well... by the acting. Besides Aniston, the very little of her, this film provides nothing that works. What was this film trying to portray, what was the message, what was the point? Answer: its Sex In The City meets Friends minus the talent, the writing and the humor.

    Edward Burns wrote and directed this bittersweet romantic comedy that has some sharp lines and a brisk pace, but whose characters resemble real people only in the fact that they have two eyes and a nose, etc. People in this movie do irrational things which are casually accepted by those around them as if the things they've done are everyday occurrences. The cast is an attractive one and they all give decent performances, even if some - such as Cameron Diaz's slutty businesswoman - are under-written. The outcome of all this preoccupation with sex and relationships is pretty obvious from the outset, but the sometimes witty lines ('let me get this straight,' asks an incredulous John Mahoney of his philandering son (Mike McGlone), 'You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?') keep things bubbling nicely. It won't stay in your memory for long, but it won't disturb you while it's in there.

    All around bad movie. I start it with that, so people who have their hopes up for a good review can just read that and know that this movie sucked! The only reason why it got anything close to a decent rating was because of Jennifer Anistonshe was funny, adorable, and charming in her role. The writer, Edward Burnsmay think of getting himself a different job. I mean, I've seen some of the movies he's written, directed, and acted inand they have (for the most part) all sucked! Now, when he is just acting in a movie (like the movie 27 Dresses), he is actually good. Maybe he needs to spend a little more time with his workor maybe he should just stick with acting and leave writing and directing alone for a while.

    Dry as a bone relationships comedy ends up being too parched to produce the humour needed. Heavily reliant on good performances, the cast (including Ed Burns, Mike McGlone, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Anniston, Maxine Bahns and John Mahoney) do well, but there are no standouts. Writer-director Burns is unfortunately unable to endear us to any of his characters in "She's the One", so you won't care who ends up with whom. Super cool, trendy yet uninspiring 90's fare.

    I didn't really know anything about this going in. That includes the fact that Burns had directed or done a script. He's pretty good, I'd give another one of his a chance. The plot is interesting and develops nicely throughout. This has quite fast pace, and at no point does it really seem to slow down, without being overwhelming in speed. The acting is marvelous, everyone hands in a solid performance. Dialog is clever and well-delivered. All of the writing is rather well-done, the story, the characters, etc. The parts are well-cast, they are all credible. This is very funny, and it doesn't particularly try too hard at getting laughs. Almost all of the humor lies in the snappy lines and exchanges. No one in this feels flat or overly perfect, they are all flawed in some way, and thus much easier to relate to. This is a nice, not too cutesy or predictable romantic comedy, with a little more of an attitude, without completely ceasing to fall into that genre. The language is relatively frequent, and definitely moderate to strong. Sexuality is mainly hinted at or mentioned, not seen. I recommend this to fans of those involved in making it. 7/10

    This is, as the summary says, one of my favorite comedies, despite the flaws pointed out by others. The reason is that it works as a metaphor for life better than it does as a literal story--parts of it are a stretch. But I think it is a wonderful comedy with some great things to say about relationships and life. A big part of why I like it is the writing, which strikes me as natural, believable, and unforced--which is certainly aided by the acting performances. Some of the lines are simply hilarious: "You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?" Or "That's an interesting theory. I hope you didn't hurt yourself coming up with that one," just to pick two. I also mostly like the acting performances. Burns and McGlone play off each other very well, and if McGlone's character can seem a bit over the top, I think that's a directorial choice to help make the point. And for those people who don't care for Maxine Bahns, I think she's better than she is given credit for. She has some moments that are just terrific, like when she first pops over the front seat of the cab and introduces herself with the story of her friend under the sink. This was the performance that convinced me that Jennifer Aniston really can act well--the scene where McGlone says he wants a divorce is wonderfully played by her-- that mix of anger and hurt and shock are portrayed beautifully. And John Mahoney is great, as is Cameron Diaz. The structural parallels are also terrific, as they illustrate the differences in the two couples. Shopping in a thrift shop as opposed to an upscale boutique, the contrast in apartments, etc., are all great devices to illustrate and underline the differences between the two brothers and couples. And using McGlone's driver as a kind of chorus worked very well, at least for me. In conclusion, this film is a ton of fun, and conveys meaning beyond what one would expect from a romantic comedy (if I have to categorize it). Is it flawed? Of course. But for me, this is a film that transcends its flaws and works on a number of levels, both literal and figurative. I highly recommend it.

    While I can't say there's any real moral compass to the storyline (with everyone cheating on everyone else), if nothing else EDWARD BURNS can consider himself a Long Island Woody Allen--because the story told in brief vignettes is exactly the sort of tale that Allen likes to spin about ditsy relationships and dysfunctional human beings. It may lack the more subtle wit and dry humor found in some of Allen's works, but it's safe to say that if this had been penned by Allen Hollywood would be jumping all over it with awards. As it is, EDWARD BURNS as the older brother--a cabbie aptly described by another as probably the only English-speaking cab driver in the city of NY--is excellent, even if some of his motivations aren't crystal clear, like the casual decision to go to Paris with his girlfriend when both of them are clearly broke. MIKE McGLONE is fine as his financially solvent but mentally challenged brother who works on Wall Street but is hopelessly in love with a trashy blonde, CAMERON DIAZ, in another one of her bubble-gum roles. None of it rises above the level of a good TV script and the language is pretty salty throughout, dealing as it does with SEX almost exclusively. But Burns directs it at a good pace and it moves briskly to a satisfying conclusion which finds him reunited with his girlfriend after a series of misunderstandings. A pleasant way to spend an hour-and-a-half but don't expect anything great. Burns and McGlone were much better in THE BROTHERS McMULLEN the previous year.

    The movie is kind of a one-two punch about relationships and the responsibilities of men within the relationships. It does a fantastic job outlining and fleshing out the female characters. As such, Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston's characters are probably some of the better written and most believable characters in the movie. (In fact, Cameron Diaz stole the show) You really do feel for some of the female casts. This, however, does not mean it gets a free pass with it's less than stellar characters... Maxine Bahns was... mediocre at best. But the rest of the male characters come across more like caricatures then real people. Mike McGlone is basically what happens if you take every alpha male stereotype, roll it through some dirt, and mix it together. I'd like to say that it's a good concept, but he comes across as just too unbelievable to me. The same can be said about John Mahoney's character, who while not as much of a caricature, can basically be summed with "chauvinistic conservative patriarch who ends up screwing up their son's lives". The only person that is even remotely likable, being Edward Burns character is a little unbelievable at times too. I think the only good moments that Ed Burns has are from the scenes where he's with Cameron Diaz. And in the end, these characters are not written to be people, they were written to be ideas and archetypes to be used for commentary. However, having said that, some of the dialogue is pretty entertaining and some of the repartee between the characters are fun to listen to. The thing is though, funny dialogue doesn't give character depth. Not bad as far as a romantic comedy goes, but definitely not home run movie.

    What's to say about a film in which Cameron Diaz is one of the better actors? The unexceptional young cast varies from okay-ish to really bad, and the script isn't much better. Aniston tries hard but she is utterly talent-free, McGlone is simply awful, Burns's girlfriend is stiff and boring, and only the director Burns seems to have a little bit of charisma to be able to play in a film like this; however, he isn't much of a director (or writer). The film tries hard to be one of those clever, sophisticated, modern relationshit comedies but comes off as lame and pretty stupid (and rather unfunny). The humour and the dialog are strictly your average TV sitcom material, except that there is no laughing track to save the jokes; and this is no "Seinfeld" - it's more like "Murphy Brown" or "Friends" or some other nit-witty, pathetic show. The dialog is forced. I haven't laughed once during the film. The bubble-gum characterization also doesn't help. Many of the relationshits in the film don't make sense, and the film as a whole is just unconvincing; the acting, the dialog, the plot, the characters - practically everything. A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face?

A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face? Or was it because he picked up a TV set from his long-gone ex-fianc&eacute;e? The viewer is actually required to accept this nonsense. Absurd. And what about Burns's wife flying to Paris? Where the hell did she find the money for a ticket to Europe if she is so goddamn broke? (Or maybe I forgot what it means to be broke for an American: having "only" one car and eating out "only" six times a week.) But never-mind this little detail; it is not one of the reasons this film is so mediocre. It all comes down to the fact that too little talent has joined together to make a movie. It seems that in the 90s any Joe Shmoe can make a movie and be hailed as a writer-director-actor prodigy.

    I am a fan of Edward Burns' movies. For the most part I thought "She's the One" was an enjoyable film. However, there was some definite ups and downs: Ups: Characters and Acting. I really liked the characters in this film Hands down, my favorite was John Mahoney as the father. He was superb has an uber-Catholic Irish hard ass father with a soft spot for his boys. Maxine Bahns was absolutely beautiful and lovable in this film as well. I also really liked the brother relationship between Edward Burns and Mike McGlone. I also have a brother that is close an age and Burns did a really great job capturing the competitive nature between siblings. Downs: Triteness. I could not watch this movie at some parts because of how cheesy some of them were. Burns did nothing to set "She the One" apart from every other 90's coming-of-age relationship film. While I thought there was some good dialogue, it could not save the film from becoming just another typical 90's dramatic comedy about relationships. Although I did enjoy this movie and always put it on whenever it I see it on HBO, this is not Edward Burns' best film. Go see Brothers McMullen, Sidewalks of New York, and the Groomsmen for better Edward Burns films. And if you have some free time..."She's the One" will do OK.

    Good job burying Aniston in the script, because she won't amount to much, and OD'ing us on whatever else is left. Not one genuinely funny moment. Too malicious for romance. Too lost for drama. I'll leave it as 90's puffery. The chemistry between Mickey and Hope, the couple we're suppose to cheer for, was non-existent. The brotherly relationship between Mickey and Francis was undercut, well... by the acting. Besides Aniston, the very little of her, this film provides nothing that works. What was this film trying to portray, what was the message, what was the point? Answer: its Sex In The City meets Friends minus the talent, the writing and the humor.

    Edward Burns wrote and directed this bittersweet romantic comedy that has some sharp lines and a brisk pace, but whose characters resemble real people only in the fact that they have two eyes and a nose, etc. People in this movie do irrational things which are casually accepted by those around them as if the things they've done are everyday occurrences. The cast is an attractive one and they all give decent performances, even if some - such as Cameron Diaz's slutty businesswoman - are under-written. The outcome of all this preoccupation with sex and relationships is pretty obvious from the outset, but the sometimes witty lines ('let me get this straight,' asks an incredulous John Mahoney of his philandering son (Mike McGlone), 'You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?') keep things bubbling nicely. It won't stay in your memory for long, but it won't disturb you while it's in there.

    All around bad movie. I start it with that, so people who have their hopes up for a good review can just read that and know that this movie sucked! The only reason why it got anything close to a decent rating was because of Jennifer Anistonshe was funny, adorable, and charming in her role. The writer, Edward Burnsmay think of getting himself a different job. I mean, I've seen some of the movies he's written, directed, and acted inand they have (for the most part) all sucked! Now, when he is just acting in a movie (like the movie 27 Dresses), he is actually good. Maybe he needs to spend a little more time with his workor maybe he should just stick with acting and leave writing and directing alone for a while.

    Dry as a bone relationships comedy ends up being too parched to produce the humour needed. Heavily reliant on good performances, the cast (including Ed Burns, Mike McGlone, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Anniston, Maxine Bahns and John Mahoney) do well, but there are no standouts. Writer-director Burns is unfortunately unable to endear us to any of his characters in "She's the One", so you won't care who ends up with whom. Super cool, trendy yet uninspiring 90's fare.

    I didn't really know anything about this going in. That includes the fact that Burns had directed or done a script. He's pretty good, I'd give another one of his a chance. The plot is interesting and develops nicely throughout. This has quite fast pace, and at no point does it really seem to slow down, without being overwhelming in speed. The acting is marvelous, everyone hands in a solid performance. Dialog is clever and well-delivered. All of the writing is rather well-done, the story, the characters, etc. The parts are well-cast, they are all credible. This is very funny, and it doesn't particularly try too hard at getting laughs. Almost all of the humor lies in the snappy lines and exchanges. No one in this feels flat or overly perfect, they are all flawed in some way, and thus much easier to relate to. This is a nice, not too cutesy or predictable romantic comedy, with a little more of an attitude, without completely ceasing to fall into that genre. The language is relatively frequent, and definitely moderate to strong. Sexuality is mainly hinted at or mentioned, not seen. I recommend this to fans of those involved in making it. 7/10

    This is, as the summary says, one of my favorite comedies, despite the flaws pointed out by others. The reason is that it works as a metaphor for life better than it does as a literal story--parts of it are a stretch. But I think it is a wonderful comedy with some great things to say about relationships and life. A big part of why I like it is the writing, which strikes me as natural, believable, and unforced--which is certainly aided by the acting performances. Some of the lines are simply hilarious: "You don't want to cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?" Or "That's an interesting theory. I hope you didn't hurt yourself coming up with that one," just to pick two. I also mostly like the acting performances. Burns and McGlone play off each other very well, and if McGlone's character can seem a bit over the top, I think that's a directorial choice to help make the point. And for those people who don't care for Maxine Bahns, I think she's better than she is given credit for. She has some moments that are just terrific, like when she first pops over the front seat of the cab and introduces herself with the story of her friend under the sink. This was the performance that convinced me that Jennifer Aniston really can act well--the scene where McGlone says he wants a divorce is wonderfully played by her-- that mix of anger and hurt and shock are portrayed beautifully. And John Mahoney is great, as is Cameron Diaz. The structural parallels are also terrific, as they illustrate the differences in the two couples. Shopping in a thrift shop as opposed to an upscale boutique, the contrast in apartments, etc., are all great devices to illustrate and underline the differences between the two brothers and couples. And using McGlone's driver as a kind of chorus worked very well, at least for me. In conclusion, this film is a ton of fun, and conveys meaning beyond what one would expect from a romantic comedy (if I have to categorize it). Is it flawed? Of course. But for me, this is a film that transcends its flaws and works on a number of levels, both literal and figurative. I highly recommend it.

    While I can't say there's any real moral compass to the storyline (with everyone cheating on everyone else), if nothing else EDWARD BURNS can consider himself a Long Island Woody Allen--because the story told in brief vignettes is exactly the sort of tale that Allen likes to spin about ditsy relationships and dysfunctional human beings. It may lack the more subtle wit and dry humor found in some of Allen's works, but it's safe to say that if this had been penned by Allen Hollywood would be jumping all over it with awards. As it is, EDWARD BURNS as the older brother--a cabbie aptly described by another as probably the only English-speaking cab driver in the city of NY--is excellent, even if some of his motivations aren't crystal clear, like the casual decision to go to Paris with his girlfriend when both of them are clearly broke. MIKE McGLONE is fine as his financially solvent but mentally challenged brother who works on Wall Street but is hopelessly in love with a trashy blonde, CAMERON DIAZ, in another one of her bubble-gum roles. None of it rises above the level of a good TV script and the language is pretty salty throughout, dealing as it does with SEX almost exclusively. But Burns directs it at a good pace and it moves briskly to a satisfying conclusion which finds him reunited with his girlfriend after a series of misunderstandings. A pleasant way to spend an hour-and-a-half but don't expect anything great. Burns and McGlone were much better in THE BROTHERS McMULLEN the previous year.

    The movie is kind of a one-two punch about relationships and the responsibilities of men within the relationships. It does a fantastic job outlining and fleshing out the female characters. As such, Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston's characters are probably some of the better written and most believable characters in the movie. (In fact, Cameron Diaz stole the show) You really do feel for some of the female casts. This, however, does not mean it gets a free pass with it's less than stellar characters... Maxine Bahns was... mediocre at best. But the rest of the male characters come across more like caricatures then real people. Mike McGlone is basically what happens if you take every alpha male stereotype, roll it through some dirt, and mix it together. I'd like to say that it's a good concept, but he comes across as just too unbelievable to me. The same can be said about John Mahoney's character, who while not as much of a caricature, can basically be summed with "chauvinistic conservative patriarch who ends up screwing up their son's lives". The only person that is even remotely likable, being Edward Burns character is a little unbelievable at times too. I think the only good moments that Ed Burns has are from the scenes where he's with Cameron Diaz. And in the end, these characters are not written to be people, they were written to be ideas and archetypes to be used for commentary. However, having said that, some of the dialogue is pretty entertaining and some of the repartee between the characters are fun to listen to. The thing is though, funny dialogue doesn't give character depth. Not bad as far as a romantic comedy goes, but definitely not home run movie.

    What's to say about a film in which Cameron Diaz is one of the better actors? The unexceptional young cast varies from okay-ish to really bad, and the script isn't much better. Aniston tries hard but she is utterly talent-free, McGlone is simply awful, Burns's girlfriend is stiff and boring, and only the director Burns seems to have a little bit of charisma to be able to play in a film like this; however, he isn't much of a director (or writer). The film tries hard to be one of those clever, sophisticated, modern relationshit comedies but comes off as lame and pretty stupid (and rather unfunny). The humour and the dialog are strictly your average TV sitcom material, except that there is no laughing track to save the jokes; and this is no "Seinfeld" - it's more like "Murphy Brown" or "Friends" or some other nit-witty, pathetic show. The dialog is forced. I haven't laughed once during the film. The bubble-gum characterization also doesn't help. Many of the relationshits in the film don't make sense, and the film as a whole is just unconvincing; the acting, the dialog, the plot, the characters - practically everything. A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face?

A few questions; how has Burns "screwed up" with his wife so that he had to apologize at the end? He didn't do anything wrong. Did he upset his wife because he punched his brother's face? Or was it because he picked up a TV set from his long-gone ex-fianc&eacute;e? The viewer is actually required to accept this nonsense. Absurd. And what about Burns's wife flying to Paris? Where the hell did she find the money for a ticket to Europe if she is so goddamn broke? (Or maybe I forgot what it means to be broke for an American: having "only" one car and eating out "only" six times a week.) But never-mind this little detail; it is not one of the reasons this film is so mediocre. It all comes down to the fact that too little talent has joined together to make a movie. It seems that in the 90s any Joe Shmoe can make a movie and be hailed as a writer-director-actor prodigy.

    I am a fan of Edward Burns' movies. For the most part I thought "She's the One" was an enjoyable film. However, there was some definite ups and downs: Ups: Characters and Acting. I really liked the characters in this film Hands down, my favorite was John Mahoney as the father. He was superb has an uber-Catholic Irish hard ass father with a soft spot for his boys. Maxine Bahns was absolutely beautiful and lovable in this film as well. I also really liked the brother relationship between Edward Burns and Mike McGlone. I also have a brother that is close an age and Burns did a really great job capturing the competitive nature between siblings. Downs: Triteness. I could not watch this movie at some parts because of how cheesy some of them were. Burns did nothing to set "She the One" apart from every other 90's coming-of-age relationship film. While I thought there was some good dialogue, it could not save the film from becoming just another typical 90's dramatic comedy about relationships. Although I did enjoy this movie and always put it on whenever it I see it on HBO, this is not Edward Burns' best film. Go see Brothers McMullen, Sidewalks of New York, and the Groomsmen for better Edward Burns films. And if you have some free time..."She's the One" will do OK.
