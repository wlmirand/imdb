    When written on paper you know the structure of this story. Girl makes friends at a High School, as time goes on they discover that they can make things happen, they abuse the power, girl from beginning backs down while the leader of the group goes insane, the conflict is resolved. Now I have just explained to you the basic plot. My one biggest beef with the movie is Robin Tunney, she can't act. She delivers the lines almost as if she is bored. Fairuza Balk on the other hand is by far the best thing about this movie. If you've seen her in enough roles (and I have) the name Fairuza Balk is almost a selling point. If only they got someone as talented as her to replace Robin Tunney. This movie is worth a watch. The Story is a good idea (even if it isn't original) and so is the performance by Fairuza Balk but that is around about it.

    Okay, first off I need to more or less shed some light on how I first watched this film. I first saw it when I was 13. I absolutely hated it. If you asked me "does The Craft rate on your bottom 20 films?" I would've answered with "Yes." I almost forgot about this movie until the start of this year when my brother sat me through Return To Oz. I more or less fell in love with Fairuza Balk's acting ability and due to that and the fact that I loved a film that runs along similar lines (Ginger Snaps) I decided it needs to be re-watched and to be honest, it wasn't bad. Okay, I have to say something about the acting. Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and even Rachel True put in solid enough performances but out of the three of them Fairuza feels like she is the only one really given any material to shine in. Unfortunately, as well, Robin Tunney was in the lead role and to pull off this specific role requires a great actress and Tunney was terrible. My mother introduced me to this movie, she loved it but even she had to admit that Tunney was awful. The plot; Three Wicca girls are awaiting a fourth member to join their group because they can't practice real magic without someone to back them up. Along comes Sarah Bailey, a girl who is a "natural witch". The three win her affections and become friends. They soon start practicing magic together after they describe their God; Manon. They all use spells to get back at people that have angered them; Nancy kills her father, Sarah makes a boy that used her actually love her, Bonnie removes the scars on her back, Rochelle makes the hair fall out of a popular girl who gave her sh!t. Soon the leader, Nancy organizes a ritual where she would be given the power of Manon. It succeeds but soon everything goes out of balance and Sarah has to find a way to stop it. Okay, this film is not perfect. The one thing that needed a bit more time is the script. If only Peter Filardi and Andrew Fleming had one more draft to work with. Just one more, I bet this film could've been an 8/10. I have given 8/10's to films with horrible acting before (Star Wars: Episode III) and I would go so far as to say that Tunney is the only problem besides the script so I would even say a 9. The visual style of this film is rather interesting to watch. While I have seen better cinematography and special effects, this film has enough "realism" to them to make me turn off "Oh yeah, Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie are flying into Sarah's room, trying to terrify her" which is rather interesting considering I was only born this film was made and when I go to see a film made today and look at its visuals, I can't turn off because it is so obviously fake. I suppose I was born at the time when the plot was meant to serve the visual effects instead of the other way 'round. Overall this film is a great watch if your thing is a mindless horror film however this is not without its problems.

    When I saw this movie for the first time (in the 90s), I was impressed. I even thought it was a bit scary. Watched it again the other day, and it's still good. But why is this movie tagged as "horror"? That it's definitely not! It's a teen drama -- that's what it is. If you watch it expecting horror, you will be hugely disappointed. It isn't one bit scary; not even creepy. But it IS quite original and entertaining. The characters are very well developed, too. I didn't think the acting was very good, but I've seen worse. Well, I have to say that the movie is very predictable, but it doesn't really spoil it much -- still entertaining. Definitely worth seeing. I've seen it several times; it's one of those movies you can watch periodically and not get tired of.

    Like most movies in Hollywood this one uses the word Witchcraft loosely. There are so many reviews I'm not going to rehash the movie. These girls in no way are practicing any form of witchcraft. Only Wiccans and ritual magicians, etc. call the Corners. Traditional Witchcraft is not like Wicca at all which is a Pagan religion developed by Gardner in the 20th Century. Many believe it is based on the ways of Witchcraft but the differences are like night and day. One must take the movie as totally baseless entertainment. It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror story but is well acted and delivered. All of the young actresses are a little old to be portraying High School students but it didn't detract from the movie at all. I found it amusing when the Mother is trying to explain who Connie Francis is and they walk off uninterested. All in all this movie was well done and anyone who likes the focus of a female dominated major cast will love this movie.

    God, what an awesome movie this is! 1996's "The Craft" is one of those really cool movies from the 90s that they just don't make anymore. The film opens up to a group of teenage witches chanting for a fourth witch to come to them and complete their circle. Then, images of fire and Wiccan symbols fill the screen and the beginning of a cover version of "Tommorrow Never Knows" by Our Lady Peace blasts out at us. As soon as I saw that, I knew this was going to be good. Enters Sara, played by Robin Tunney of "The Mentalist", who is just arriving to a new town and school. There, she meets up with the outcast group of witches who are Nancy (Played by the great Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (played by Neve Campbell of "Scream" fame), and Rochelle (played by Rachel True who gives a convincing performance of being the only black person at her school). While reluctant at first, Sara eventually joins the coven and together they conjure up magic and life is good, at first. Each one wishes for something and they get it but at a cost. Since I don't want to spoil the movie for others, I won't go too much into detail about that. What I will say is "The Craft", while being about teenage girls and obviously being aimed at that group, is a movie that anyone can enjoy. First and foremost, who doesn't love magic and second it deals with the issue of feeling like an outsider and/or being picked on, and just about everyone would fall into one of those categories at least once in their life. Add in a great MTV generation soundtrack and you got yourself "The Craft". Don't miss it.

    Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell, Rachel True, Skeet Ulrich, Christine Taylor and Cliff De Young star in this 1996 horror film. Sarah (Tunney) has just moved to L.A. with her father (De Young) and stepmother. She meets and befriends 3 outcast girls, Nancy (Balk), Bonnie (Campbell) and Rochelle (True) who practice witchcraft to strike back at tormentors. They learn that Sarah is a natural witch and together they perform magic until Nancy becomes power crazy. Ulrich plays Chris, a teen who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she puts a spell on him and Taylor plays Laura, a bimbo teen who is cruel to Rochelle until she gets a spell put on her. This is pretty good and it's funny that Fairuza was a witch 10 years prior in "The Worst Witch." I recommend this.

    Teen angst movies are rarely realistic, and more rarely cast actual teenagers. A gaggle of twenty-somethings working through their collective angst with witchcraft is about as far-fetched as you can get. I'd willing to accept all of this if the film were clever or atmospheric, but it achieves neither, opting for a TV-style, by-the-numbers approach. It could have been so much more. The story features four outcast girls (the sad, pouting Robin Tunney, the 29-year-old Rachel True, the mightily-boobed Neve Campbell, and the absolutely dee-lish Fairuza Balk) who come together to invoke the spirit of Manon (as sort-of universal deity with unlimited power) in order to satisfy their petty desires. Low-wattage drama with not one shred of an epic moment follows. I liked this film when I saw it in the cinema as a teenager, mainly because of the yummy girls. As an adult I can see that the film has lots of lame dialogue, bad editing, and poor photography. Revenge fantasies, especially for high school kids, are clich&eacute;d and old-fashioned as well as being dangerous. There's not much reason to watch this other than ogling the skin on show. Why this got an R-rating is beyond me. Apparently the MPAA regarded the witchcraft to be dangerous and insisted on an R when the film is clearly no harder than a PG-13. I think this is absolutely moronic. With their logic Harry Potter and Charmed should be for adults only.

    "Clueless meets Carrie", and "a slick, hip, smart arse movie," are what the critics allegedly call the movie (or so the back of the box says. For all we know the quote could have been "it is not a slick  movie"). I have not seen Carrie (as of the time of writing), but The Craft is nothing like Clueless, nor is it slick, hip, or smart arse. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't one that catapults to the top of excellence either. The Craft is about a girl who moves to Los Angeles and goes to a Catholic School. She begins as an outcast because she is new, and is pushed even further out when she refuses to go to bed with Chris, the school stud. As such she ends up joining with the school's misfits who are rumoured to be witches. They are actually witches, but they need a forth person to make their power work, and Sarah, the new kid, happens to be the perfect forth person. They claim to worship the god Mamoun, who is basically all of nature. They claim that Mamoun is older than any other god and is the only true god. God was only created by mankind who chose to ignore Mamoun. This I dispute because I believe Mamoun was created by man who did not want to worship the true God. Mamoun is nature while God is beyond nature as he created nature and as such expects us to look after it. Mamoun bestows these girls with magical powers, but whatever these girls do is revisited upon them three times. Sarah wants to get back at Chris so makes him fall in love with her, but this love spell backfires and she cannot get away from him. He is so madly in love with her that his sexual urges are fired up to the point where he is do anything to have sex with her, including raping her. Danny becomes corrupted by the power that she works with. She is little more than white trash, living in a small house with quarrelling parents. She wants out anyway she can so she basically asks for the power of Mamoun, but after somebody close to them dies Sarah wants out and Danny will not let her. This movie is about how power corrupts people if one is not careful. The one that was corrupted the most was the one that had the least. As such it seems that it is attacking the rags to riches philosophy. Those who are poor and powerless are that way because they do not know how to handle power. This is not always the case though because some poor people rise to power and are remembered for their goodness, while others who are born rich are intensely corrupt and abuse their power constantly. My friends rave about this movie, but I don't think that it is that great. It is just fancy effects and magic in the modern time with a pretty simple plot. The plot itself does not grab me and the characters have little depth. They are simply unpopular people who really want to become popular, and there is little else to them. Thus, unfortunately, is the way people are anyway.

    Effective 90's teen-oriented horror told from the perspective of young women, and how they are able to use witchcraft to affect changes in people, places, and things. At first, it's all in good fun, and they're having a high old time, but naturally before long things just get way out of hand. Sarah (Robin Tunney) is a shy, troubled girl with innate supernatural abilities who becomes part of a very small clique of outsiders: Rochelle (Rachel True), Bonnie (Neve Campbell), and Nancy (Fairuza Balk). It's interesting to note that as their powers grow, they really start to blossom, especially Bonnie, although this of course isn't necessarily for the better. Co- screenwriter and director Andrew Fleming ("Bad Dreams", "Threesome", "Dick") gets engaging performances out of his star quartet, with Balk very much dominating the proceedings as a girl desperate to put her trailer trash existence behind her, and who ultimately becomes completely unhinged. Good supporting performances by Assumpta Serna, as the helpful Lirio, owner of the shop that the girls frequent, Christine Taylor, as the stuck up Laura whose blatant racism towards Rochelle results in a fairly interesting comeuppance, and the amusing Skeet Ulrich, Campbell's co-star in "Scream" from the same year, as the initially unfeeling jock who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she casts a spell on him. Cliff De Young is barely seen and under utilized as Sarah's dad, but his fellow veteran Helen Shaver has one of the more unlikely roles of her career (not that she doesn't do a great job) as Nancy's mother. This kind of story could easily descend into a cheese fest but in this instance it's actually very well done, with a decidedly dark tone in its later parts, so it can definitely be taken seriously, with a final act full of creepy crawlies - snakes, scorpions, spiders, rats, etc. - and some genuinely effective atmosphere, leading to a reasonably intense confrontation between protagonist and antagonist. Commendably, Lirio asserts the idea that magic isn't necessarily "black" or "good" but that it largely depends on the individual, so this movie at least isn't going for the usual clich&eacute;s when it comes to this sort of thing. A good, entertaining, intriguing movie with a punchy wrap-up, "The Craft" provides a fine showcase for its attractive young actresses and is overall worth a look. Seven out of 10.

    Although it looks like those cheap and hastily made, straight-to-DVD films, it was actually good to watch. Nothing groundbreaking, but quite good for a night home. It did have a story behind it ( troubled teenagers, dysfunctional families, social prejudices), it did have some acting (where I thought there would be nothing but sleazy chicks that try to make an impression). The filming was good, too. Intense and tight. At some points it was a real thriller. Not gore or something, but quite disturbing. Better than some block busters. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

Why this got an R-rating is beyond me. Apparently the MPAA regarded the witchcraft to be dangerous and insisted on an R when the film is clearly no harder than a PG-13. I think this is absolutely moronic. With their logic Harry Potter and Charmed should be for adults only.

    "Clueless meets Carrie", and "a slick, hip, smart arse movie," are what the critics allegedly call the movie (or so the back of the box says. For all we know the quote could have been "it is not a slick  movie"). I have not seen Carrie (as of the time of writing), but The Craft is nothing like Clueless, nor is it slick, hip, or smart arse. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't one that catapults to the top of excellence either. The Craft is about a girl who moves to Los Angeles and goes to a Catholic School. She begins as an outcast because she is new, and is pushed even further out when she refuses to go to bed with Chris, the school stud. As such she ends up joining with the school's misfits who are rumoured to be witches. They are actually witches, but they need a forth person to make their power work, and Sarah, the new kid, happens to be the perfect forth person. They claim to worship the god Mamoun, who is basically all of nature. They claim that Mamoun is older than any other god and is the only true god. God was only created by mankind who chose to ignore Mamoun. This I dispute because I believe Mamoun was created by man who did not want to worship the true God. Mamoun is nature while God is beyond nature as he created nature and as such expects us to look after it. Mamoun bestows these girls with magical powers, but whatever these girls do is revisited upon them three times. Sarah wants to get back at Chris so makes him fall in love with her, but this love spell backfires and she cannot get away from him. He is so madly in love with her that his sexual urges are fired up to the point where he is do anything to have sex with her, including raping her. Danny becomes corrupted by the power that she works with. She is little more than white trash, living in a small house with quarrelling parents. She wants out anyway she can so she basically asks for the power of Mamoun, but after somebody close to them dies Sarah wants out and Danny will not let her. This movie is about how power corrupts people if one is not careful. The one that was corrupted the most was the one that had the least. As such it seems that it is attacking the rags to riches philosophy. Those who are poor and powerless are that way because they do not know how to handle power. This is not always the case though because some poor people rise to power and are remembered for their goodness, while others who are born rich are intensely corrupt and abuse their power constantly. My friends rave about this movie, but I don't think that it is that great. It is just fancy effects and magic in the modern time with a pretty simple plot. The plot itself does not grab me and the characters have little depth. They are simply unpopular people who really want to become popular, and there is little else to them. Thus, unfortunately, is the way people are anyway.

    Effective 90's teen-oriented horror told from the perspective of young women, and how they are able to use witchcraft to affect changes in people, places, and things. At first, it's all in good fun, and they're having a high old time, but naturally before long things just get way out of hand. Sarah (Robin Tunney) is a shy, troubled girl with innate supernatural abilities who becomes part of a very small clique of outsiders: Rochelle (Rachel True), Bonnie (Neve Campbell), and Nancy (Fairuza Balk). It's interesting to note that as their powers grow, they really start to blossom, especially Bonnie, although this of course isn't necessarily for the better. Co- screenwriter and director Andrew Fleming ("Bad Dreams", "Threesome", "Dick") gets engaging performances out of his star quartet, with Balk very much dominating the proceedings as a girl desperate to put her trailer trash existence behind her, and who ultimately becomes completely unhinged. Good supporting performances by Assumpta Serna, as the helpful Lirio, owner of the shop that the girls frequent, Christine Taylor, as the stuck up Laura whose blatant racism towards Rochelle results in a fairly interesting comeuppance, and the amusing Skeet Ulrich, Campbell's co-star in "Scream" from the same year, as the initially unfeeling jock who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she casts a spell on him. Cliff De Young is barely seen and under utilized as Sarah's dad, but his fellow veteran Helen Shaver has one of the more unlikely roles of her career (not that she doesn't do a great job) as Nancy's mother. This kind of story could easily descend into a cheese fest but in this instance it's actually very well done, with a decidedly dark tone in its later parts, so it can definitely be taken seriously, with a final act full of creepy crawlies - snakes, scorpions, spiders, rats, etc. - and some genuinely effective atmosphere, leading to a reasonably intense confrontation between protagonist and antagonist. Commendably, Lirio asserts the idea that magic isn't necessarily "black" or "good" but that it largely depends on the individual, so this movie at least isn't going for the usual clich&eacute;s when it comes to this sort of thing. A good, entertaining, intriguing movie with a punchy wrap-up, "The Craft" provides a fine showcase for its attractive young actresses and is overall worth a look. Seven out of 10.

    Although it looks like those cheap and hastily made, straight-to-DVD films, it was actually good to watch. Nothing groundbreaking, but quite good for a night home. It did have a story behind it ( troubled teenagers, dysfunctional families, social prejudices), it did have some acting (where I thought there would be nothing but sleazy chicks that try to make an impression). The filming was good, too. Intense and tight. At some points it was a real thriller. Not gore or something, but quite disturbing. Better than some block busters. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

    When written on paper you know the structure of this story. Girl makes friends at a High School, as time goes on they discover that they can make things happen, they abuse the power, girl from beginning backs down while the leader of the group goes insane, the conflict is resolved. Now I have just explained to you the basic plot. My one biggest beef with the movie is Robin Tunney, she can't act. She delivers the lines almost as if she is bored. Fairuza Balk on the other hand is by far the best thing about this movie. If you've seen her in enough roles (and I have) the name Fairuza Balk is almost a selling point. If only they got someone as talented as her to replace Robin Tunney. This movie is worth a watch. The Story is a good idea (even if it isn't original) and so is the performance by Fairuza Balk but that is around about it.

    Okay, first off I need to more or less shed some light on how I first watched this film. I first saw it when I was 13. I absolutely hated it. If you asked me "does The Craft rate on your bottom 20 films?" I would've answered with "Yes." I almost forgot about this movie until the start of this year when my brother sat me through Return To Oz. I more or less fell in love with Fairuza Balk's acting ability and due to that and the fact that I loved a film that runs along similar lines (Ginger Snaps) I decided it needs to be re-watched and to be honest, it wasn't bad. Okay, I have to say something about the acting. Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and even Rachel True put in solid enough performances but out of the three of them Fairuza feels like she is the only one really given any material to shine in. Unfortunately, as well, Robin Tunney was in the lead role and to pull off this specific role requires a great actress and Tunney was terrible. My mother introduced me to this movie, she loved it but even she had to admit that Tunney was awful. The plot; Three Wicca girls are awaiting a fourth member to join their group because they can't practice real magic without someone to back them up. Along comes Sarah Bailey, a girl who is a "natural witch". The three win her affections and become friends. They soon start practicing magic together after they describe their God; Manon. They all use spells to get back at people that have angered them; Nancy kills her father, Sarah makes a boy that used her actually love her, Bonnie removes the scars on her back, Rochelle makes the hair fall out of a popular girl who gave her sh!t. Soon the leader, Nancy organizes a ritual where she would be given the power of Manon. It succeeds but soon everything goes out of balance and Sarah has to find a way to stop it. Okay, this film is not perfect. The one thing that needed a bit more time is the script. If only Peter Filardi and Andrew Fleming had one more draft to work with. Just one more, I bet this film could've been an 8/10. I have given 8/10's to films with horrible acting before (Star Wars: Episode III) and I would go so far as to say that Tunney is the only problem besides the script so I would even say a 9. The visual style of this film is rather interesting to watch. While I have seen better cinematography and special effects, this film has enough "realism" to them to make me turn off "Oh yeah, Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie are flying into Sarah's room, trying to terrify her" which is rather interesting considering I was only born this film was made and when I go to see a film made today and look at its visuals, I can't turn off because it is so obviously fake. I suppose I was born at the time when the plot was meant to serve the visual effects instead of the other way 'round. Overall this film is a great watch if your thing is a mindless horror film however this is not without its problems.

    When I saw this movie for the first time (in the 90s), I was impressed. I even thought it was a bit scary. Watched it again the other day, and it's still good. But why is this movie tagged as "horror"? That it's definitely not! It's a teen drama -- that's what it is. If you watch it expecting horror, you will be hugely disappointed. It isn't one bit scary; not even creepy. But it IS quite original and entertaining. The characters are very well developed, too. I didn't think the acting was very good, but I've seen worse. Well, I have to say that the movie is very predictable, but it doesn't really spoil it much -- still entertaining. Definitely worth seeing. I've seen it several times; it's one of those movies you can watch periodically and not get tired of.

    Like most movies in Hollywood this one uses the word Witchcraft loosely. There are so many reviews I'm not going to rehash the movie. These girls in no way are practicing any form of witchcraft. Only Wiccans and ritual magicians, etc. call the Corners. Traditional Witchcraft is not like Wicca at all which is a Pagan religion developed by Gardner in the 20th Century. Many believe it is based on the ways of Witchcraft but the differences are like night and day. One must take the movie as totally baseless entertainment. It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror story but is well acted and delivered. All of the young actresses are a little old to be portraying High School students but it didn't detract from the movie at all. I found it amusing when the Mother is trying to explain who Connie Francis is and they walk off uninterested. All in all this movie was well done and anyone who likes the focus of a female dominated major cast will love this movie.

    God, what an awesome movie this is! 1996's "The Craft" is one of those really cool movies from the 90s that they just don't make anymore. The film opens up to a group of teenage witches chanting for a fourth witch to come to them and complete their circle. Then, images of fire and Wiccan symbols fill the screen and the beginning of a cover version of "Tommorrow Never Knows" by Our Lady Peace blasts out at us. As soon as I saw that, I knew this was going to be good. Enters Sara, played by Robin Tunney of "The Mentalist", who is just arriving to a new town and school. There, she meets up with the outcast group of witches who are Nancy (Played by the great Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (played by Neve Campbell of "Scream" fame), and Rochelle (played by Rachel True who gives a convincing performance of being the only black person at her school). While reluctant at first, Sara eventually joins the coven and together they conjure up magic and life is good, at first. Each one wishes for something and they get it but at a cost. Since I don't want to spoil the movie for others, I won't go too much into detail about that. What I will say is "The Craft", while being about teenage girls and obviously being aimed at that group, is a movie that anyone can enjoy. First and foremost, who doesn't love magic and second it deals with the issue of feeling like an outsider and/or being picked on, and just about everyone would fall into one of those categories at least once in their life. Add in a great MTV generation soundtrack and you got yourself "The Craft". Don't miss it.

    Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell, Rachel True, Skeet Ulrich, Christine Taylor and Cliff De Young star in this 1996 horror film. Sarah (Tunney) has just moved to L.A. with her father (De Young) and stepmother. She meets and befriends 3 outcast girls, Nancy (Balk), Bonnie (Campbell) and Rochelle (True) who practice witchcraft to strike back at tormentors. They learn that Sarah is a natural witch and together they perform magic until Nancy becomes power crazy. Ulrich plays Chris, a teen who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she puts a spell on him and Taylor plays Laura, a bimbo teen who is cruel to Rochelle until she gets a spell put on her. This is pretty good and it's funny that Fairuza was a witch 10 years prior in "The Worst Witch." I recommend this.

    Teen angst movies are rarely realistic, and more rarely cast actual teenagers. A gaggle of twenty-somethings working through their collective angst with witchcraft is about as far-fetched as you can get. I'd willing to accept all of this if the film were clever or atmospheric, but it achieves neither, opting for a TV-style, by-the-numbers approach. It could have been so much more. The story features four outcast girls (the sad, pouting Robin Tunney, the 29-year-old Rachel True, the mightily-boobed Neve Campbell, and the absolutely dee-lish Fairuza Balk) who come together to invoke the spirit of Manon (as sort-of universal deity with unlimited power) in order to satisfy their petty desires. Low-wattage drama with not one shred of an epic moment follows. I liked this film when I saw it in the cinema as a teenager, mainly because of the yummy girls. As an adult I can see that the film has lots of lame dialogue, bad editing, and poor photography. Revenge fantasies, especially for high school kids, are clich&eacute;d and old-fashioned as well as being dangerous. There's not much reason to watch this other than ogling the skin on show. Why this got an R-rating is beyond me. Apparently the MPAA regarded the witchcraft to be dangerous and insisted on an R when the film is clearly no harder than a PG-13. I think this is absolutely moronic. With their logic Harry Potter and Charmed should be for adults only.

All of the young actresses are a little old to be portraying High School students but it didn't detract from the movie at all. I found it amusing when the Mother is trying to explain who Connie Francis is and they walk off uninterested. All in all this movie was well done and anyone who likes the focus of a female dominated major cast will love this movie.

    God, what an awesome movie this is! 1996's "The Craft" is one of those really cool movies from the 90s that they just don't make anymore. The film opens up to a group of teenage witches chanting for a fourth witch to come to them and complete their circle. Then, images of fire and Wiccan symbols fill the screen and the beginning of a cover version of "Tommorrow Never Knows" by Our Lady Peace blasts out at us. As soon as I saw that, I knew this was going to be good. Enters Sara, played by Robin Tunney of "The Mentalist", who is just arriving to a new town and school. There, she meets up with the outcast group of witches who are Nancy (Played by the great Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (played by Neve Campbell of "Scream" fame), and Rochelle (played by Rachel True who gives a convincing performance of being the only black person at her school). While reluctant at first, Sara eventually joins the coven and together they conjure up magic and life is good, at first. Each one wishes for something and they get it but at a cost. Since I don't want to spoil the movie for others, I won't go too much into detail about that. What I will say is "The Craft", while being about teenage girls and obviously being aimed at that group, is a movie that anyone can enjoy. First and foremost, who doesn't love magic and second it deals with the issue of feeling like an outsider and/or being picked on, and just about everyone would fall into one of those categories at least once in their life. Add in a great MTV generation soundtrack and you got yourself "The Craft". Don't miss it.

    Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell, Rachel True, Skeet Ulrich, Christine Taylor and Cliff De Young star in this 1996 horror film. Sarah (Tunney) has just moved to L.A. with her father (De Young) and stepmother. She meets and befriends 3 outcast girls, Nancy (Balk), Bonnie (Campbell) and Rochelle (True) who practice witchcraft to strike back at tormentors. They learn that Sarah is a natural witch and together they perform magic until Nancy becomes power crazy. Ulrich plays Chris, a teen who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she puts a spell on him and Taylor plays Laura, a bimbo teen who is cruel to Rochelle until she gets a spell put on her. This is pretty good and it's funny that Fairuza was a witch 10 years prior in "The Worst Witch." I recommend this.

    Teen angst movies are rarely realistic, and more rarely cast actual teenagers. A gaggle of twenty-somethings working through their collective angst with witchcraft is about as far-fetched as you can get. I'd willing to accept all of this if the film were clever or atmospheric, but it achieves neither, opting for a TV-style, by-the-numbers approach. It could have been so much more. The story features four outcast girls (the sad, pouting Robin Tunney, the 29-year-old Rachel True, the mightily-boobed Neve Campbell, and the absolutely dee-lish Fairuza Balk) who come together to invoke the spirit of Manon (as sort-of universal deity with unlimited power) in order to satisfy their petty desires. Low-wattage drama with not one shred of an epic moment follows. I liked this film when I saw it in the cinema as a teenager, mainly because of the yummy girls. As an adult I can see that the film has lots of lame dialogue, bad editing, and poor photography. Revenge fantasies, especially for high school kids, are clich&eacute;d and old-fashioned as well as being dangerous. There's not much reason to watch this other than ogling the skin on show. Why this got an R-rating is beyond me. Apparently the MPAA regarded the witchcraft to be dangerous and insisted on an R when the film is clearly no harder than a PG-13. I think this is absolutely moronic. With their logic Harry Potter and Charmed should be for adults only.

    "Clueless meets Carrie", and "a slick, hip, smart arse movie," are what the critics allegedly call the movie (or so the back of the box says. For all we know the quote could have been "it is not a slick  movie"). I have not seen Carrie (as of the time of writing), but The Craft is nothing like Clueless, nor is it slick, hip, or smart arse. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't one that catapults to the top of excellence either. The Craft is about a girl who moves to Los Angeles and goes to a Catholic School. She begins as an outcast because she is new, and is pushed even further out when she refuses to go to bed with Chris, the school stud. As such she ends up joining with the school's misfits who are rumoured to be witches. They are actually witches, but they need a forth person to make their power work, and Sarah, the new kid, happens to be the perfect forth person. They claim to worship the god Mamoun, who is basically all of nature. They claim that Mamoun is older than any other god and is the only true god. God was only created by mankind who chose to ignore Mamoun. This I dispute because I believe Mamoun was created by man who did not want to worship the true God. Mamoun is nature while God is beyond nature as he created nature and as such expects us to look after it. Mamoun bestows these girls with magical powers, but whatever these girls do is revisited upon them three times. Sarah wants to get back at Chris so makes him fall in love with her, but this love spell backfires and she cannot get away from him. He is so madly in love with her that his sexual urges are fired up to the point where he is do anything to have sex with her, including raping her. Danny becomes corrupted by the power that she works with. She is little more than white trash, living in a small house with quarrelling parents. She wants out anyway she can so she basically asks for the power of Mamoun, but after somebody close to them dies Sarah wants out and Danny will not let her. This movie is about how power corrupts people if one is not careful. The one that was corrupted the most was the one that had the least. As such it seems that it is attacking the rags to riches philosophy. Those who are poor and powerless are that way because they do not know how to handle power. This is not always the case though because some poor people rise to power and are remembered for their goodness, while others who are born rich are intensely corrupt and abuse their power constantly. My friends rave about this movie, but I don't think that it is that great. It is just fancy effects and magic in the modern time with a pretty simple plot. The plot itself does not grab me and the characters have little depth. They are simply unpopular people who really want to become popular, and there is little else to them. Thus, unfortunately, is the way people are anyway.

    Effective 90's teen-oriented horror told from the perspective of young women, and how they are able to use witchcraft to affect changes in people, places, and things. At first, it's all in good fun, and they're having a high old time, but naturally before long things just get way out of hand. Sarah (Robin Tunney) is a shy, troubled girl with innate supernatural abilities who becomes part of a very small clique of outsiders: Rochelle (Rachel True), Bonnie (Neve Campbell), and Nancy (Fairuza Balk). It's interesting to note that as their powers grow, they really start to blossom, especially Bonnie, although this of course isn't necessarily for the better. Co- screenwriter and director Andrew Fleming ("Bad Dreams", "Threesome", "Dick") gets engaging performances out of his star quartet, with Balk very much dominating the proceedings as a girl desperate to put her trailer trash existence behind her, and who ultimately becomes completely unhinged. Good supporting performances by Assumpta Serna, as the helpful Lirio, owner of the shop that the girls frequent, Christine Taylor, as the stuck up Laura whose blatant racism towards Rochelle results in a fairly interesting comeuppance, and the amusing Skeet Ulrich, Campbell's co-star in "Scream" from the same year, as the initially unfeeling jock who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she casts a spell on him. Cliff De Young is barely seen and under utilized as Sarah's dad, but his fellow veteran Helen Shaver has one of the more unlikely roles of her career (not that she doesn't do a great job) as Nancy's mother. This kind of story could easily descend into a cheese fest but in this instance it's actually very well done, with a decidedly dark tone in its later parts, so it can definitely be taken seriously, with a final act full of creepy crawlies - snakes, scorpions, spiders, rats, etc. - and some genuinely effective atmosphere, leading to a reasonably intense confrontation between protagonist and antagonist. Commendably, Lirio asserts the idea that magic isn't necessarily "black" or "good" but that it largely depends on the individual, so this movie at least isn't going for the usual clich&eacute;s when it comes to this sort of thing. A good, entertaining, intriguing movie with a punchy wrap-up, "The Craft" provides a fine showcase for its attractive young actresses and is overall worth a look. Seven out of 10.

    Although it looks like those cheap and hastily made, straight-to-DVD films, it was actually good to watch. Nothing groundbreaking, but quite good for a night home. It did have a story behind it ( troubled teenagers, dysfunctional families, social prejudices), it did have some acting (where I thought there would be nothing but sleazy chicks that try to make an impression). The filming was good, too. Intense and tight. At some points it was a real thriller. Not gore or something, but quite disturbing. Better than some block busters. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

    When written on paper you know the structure of this story. Girl makes friends at a High School, as time goes on they discover that they can make things happen, they abuse the power, girl from beginning backs down while the leader of the group goes insane, the conflict is resolved. Now I have just explained to you the basic plot. My one biggest beef with the movie is Robin Tunney, she can't act. She delivers the lines almost as if she is bored. Fairuza Balk on the other hand is by far the best thing about this movie. If you've seen her in enough roles (and I have) the name Fairuza Balk is almost a selling point. If only they got someone as talented as her to replace Robin Tunney. This movie is worth a watch. The Story is a good idea (even if it isn't original) and so is the performance by Fairuza Balk but that is around about it.

    Okay, first off I need to more or less shed some light on how I first watched this film. I first saw it when I was 13. I absolutely hated it. If you asked me "does The Craft rate on your bottom 20 films?" I would've answered with "Yes." I almost forgot about this movie until the start of this year when my brother sat me through Return To Oz. I more or less fell in love with Fairuza Balk's acting ability and due to that and the fact that I loved a film that runs along similar lines (Ginger Snaps) I decided it needs to be re-watched and to be honest, it wasn't bad. Okay, I have to say something about the acting. Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and even Rachel True put in solid enough performances but out of the three of them Fairuza feels like she is the only one really given any material to shine in. Unfortunately, as well, Robin Tunney was in the lead role and to pull off this specific role requires a great actress and Tunney was terrible. My mother introduced me to this movie, she loved it but even she had to admit that Tunney was awful. The plot; Three Wicca girls are awaiting a fourth member to join their group because they can't practice real magic without someone to back them up. Along comes Sarah Bailey, a girl who is a "natural witch". The three win her affections and become friends. They soon start practicing magic together after they describe their God; Manon. They all use spells to get back at people that have angered them; Nancy kills her father, Sarah makes a boy that used her actually love her, Bonnie removes the scars on her back, Rochelle makes the hair fall out of a popular girl who gave her sh!t. Soon the leader, Nancy organizes a ritual where she would be given the power of Manon. It succeeds but soon everything goes out of balance and Sarah has to find a way to stop it. Okay, this film is not perfect. The one thing that needed a bit more time is the script. If only Peter Filardi and Andrew Fleming had one more draft to work with. Just one more, I bet this film could've been an 8/10. I have given 8/10's to films with horrible acting before (Star Wars: Episode III) and I would go so far as to say that Tunney is the only problem besides the script so I would even say a 9. The visual style of this film is rather interesting to watch. While I have seen better cinematography and special effects, this film has enough "realism" to them to make me turn off "Oh yeah, Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie are flying into Sarah's room, trying to terrify her" which is rather interesting considering I was only born this film was made and when I go to see a film made today and look at its visuals, I can't turn off because it is so obviously fake. I suppose I was born at the time when the plot was meant to serve the visual effects instead of the other way 'round. Overall this film is a great watch if your thing is a mindless horror film however this is not without its problems.

    When I saw this movie for the first time (in the 90s), I was impressed. I even thought it was a bit scary. Watched it again the other day, and it's still good. But why is this movie tagged as "horror"? That it's definitely not! It's a teen drama -- that's what it is. If you watch it expecting horror, you will be hugely disappointed. It isn't one bit scary; not even creepy. But it IS quite original and entertaining. The characters are very well developed, too. I didn't think the acting was very good, but I've seen worse. Well, I have to say that the movie is very predictable, but it doesn't really spoil it much -- still entertaining. Definitely worth seeing. I've seen it several times; it's one of those movies you can watch periodically and not get tired of.

    Like most movies in Hollywood this one uses the word Witchcraft loosely. There are so many reviews I'm not going to rehash the movie. These girls in no way are practicing any form of witchcraft. Only Wiccans and ritual magicians, etc. call the Corners. Traditional Witchcraft is not like Wicca at all which is a Pagan religion developed by Gardner in the 20th Century. Many believe it is based on the ways of Witchcraft but the differences are like night and day. One must take the movie as totally baseless entertainment. It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror story but is well acted and delivered. All of the young actresses are a little old to be portraying High School students but it didn't detract from the movie at all. I found it amusing when the Mother is trying to explain who Connie Francis is and they walk off uninterested.

If you asked me "does The Craft rate on your bottom 20 films?" I would've answered with "Yes." I almost forgot about this movie until the start of this year when my brother sat me through Return To Oz. I more or less fell in love with Fairuza Balk's acting ability and due to that and the fact that I loved a film that runs along similar lines (Ginger Snaps) I decided it needs to be re-watched and to be honest, it wasn't bad. Okay, I have to say something about the acting. Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and even Rachel True put in solid enough performances but out of the three of them Fairuza feels like she is the only one really given any material to shine in. Unfortunately, as well, Robin Tunney was in the lead role and to pull off this specific role requires a great actress and Tunney was terrible. My mother introduced me to this movie, she loved it but even she had to admit that Tunney was awful. The plot; Three Wicca girls are awaiting a fourth member to join their group because they can't practice real magic without someone to back them up. Along comes Sarah Bailey, a girl who is a "natural witch". The three win her affections and become friends. They soon start practicing magic together after they describe their God; Manon. They all use spells to get back at people that have angered them; Nancy kills her father, Sarah makes a boy that used her actually love her, Bonnie removes the scars on her back, Rochelle makes the hair fall out of a popular girl who gave her sh!t. Soon the leader, Nancy organizes a ritual where she would be given the power of Manon. It succeeds but soon everything goes out of balance and Sarah has to find a way to stop it. Okay, this film is not perfect. The one thing that needed a bit more time is the script. If only Peter Filardi and Andrew Fleming had one more draft to work with. Just one more, I bet this film could've been an 8/10. I have given 8/10's to films with horrible acting before (Star Wars: Episode III) and I would go so far as to say that Tunney is the only problem besides the script so I would even say a 9. The visual style of this film is rather interesting to watch. While I have seen better cinematography and special effects, this film has enough "realism" to them to make me turn off "Oh yeah, Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie are flying into Sarah's room, trying to terrify her" which is rather interesting considering I was only born this film was made and when I go to see a film made today and look at its visuals, I can't turn off because it is so obviously fake. I suppose I was born at the time when the plot was meant to serve the visual effects instead of the other way 'round. Overall this film is a great watch if your thing is a mindless horror film however this is not without its problems.

    When I saw this movie for the first time (in the 90s), I was impressed. I even thought it was a bit scary. Watched it again the other day, and it's still good. But why is this movie tagged as "horror"? That it's definitely not! It's a teen drama -- that's what it is. If you watch it expecting horror, you will be hugely disappointed. It isn't one bit scary; not even creepy. But it IS quite original and entertaining. The characters are very well developed, too. I didn't think the acting was very good, but I've seen worse. Well, I have to say that the movie is very predictable, but it doesn't really spoil it much -- still entertaining. Definitely worth seeing. I've seen it several times; it's one of those movies you can watch periodically and not get tired of.

    Like most movies in Hollywood this one uses the word Witchcraft loosely. There are so many reviews I'm not going to rehash the movie. These girls in no way are practicing any form of witchcraft. Only Wiccans and ritual magicians, etc. call the Corners. Traditional Witchcraft is not like Wicca at all which is a Pagan religion developed by Gardner in the 20th Century. Many believe it is based on the ways of Witchcraft but the differences are like night and day. One must take the movie as totally baseless entertainment. It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror story but is well acted and delivered. All of the young actresses are a little old to be portraying High School students but it didn't detract from the movie at all. I found it amusing when the Mother is trying to explain who Connie Francis is and they walk off uninterested. All in all this movie was well done and anyone who likes the focus of a female dominated major cast will love this movie.

    God, what an awesome movie this is! 1996's "The Craft" is one of those really cool movies from the 90s that they just don't make anymore. The film opens up to a group of teenage witches chanting for a fourth witch to come to them and complete their circle. Then, images of fire and Wiccan symbols fill the screen and the beginning of a cover version of "Tommorrow Never Knows" by Our Lady Peace blasts out at us. As soon as I saw that, I knew this was going to be good. Enters Sara, played by Robin Tunney of "The Mentalist", who is just arriving to a new town and school. There, she meets up with the outcast group of witches who are Nancy (Played by the great Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (played by Neve Campbell of "Scream" fame), and Rochelle (played by Rachel True who gives a convincing performance of being the only black person at her school). While reluctant at first, Sara eventually joins the coven and together they conjure up magic and life is good, at first. Each one wishes for something and they get it but at a cost. Since I don't want to spoil the movie for others, I won't go too much into detail about that. What I will say is "The Craft", while being about teenage girls and obviously being aimed at that group, is a movie that anyone can enjoy. First and foremost, who doesn't love magic and second it deals with the issue of feeling like an outsider and/or being picked on, and just about everyone would fall into one of those categories at least once in their life. Add in a great MTV generation soundtrack and you got yourself "The Craft". Don't miss it.

    Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell, Rachel True, Skeet Ulrich, Christine Taylor and Cliff De Young star in this 1996 horror film. Sarah (Tunney) has just moved to L.A. with her father (De Young) and stepmother. She meets and befriends 3 outcast girls, Nancy (Balk), Bonnie (Campbell) and Rochelle (True) who practice witchcraft to strike back at tormentors. They learn that Sarah is a natural witch and together they perform magic until Nancy becomes power crazy. Ulrich plays Chris, a teen who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she puts a spell on him and Taylor plays Laura, a bimbo teen who is cruel to Rochelle until she gets a spell put on her. This is pretty good and it's funny that Fairuza was a witch 10 years prior in "The Worst Witch." I recommend this.

    Teen angst movies are rarely realistic, and more rarely cast actual teenagers. A gaggle of twenty-somethings working through their collective angst with witchcraft is about as far-fetched as you can get. I'd willing to accept all of this if the film were clever or atmospheric, but it achieves neither, opting for a TV-style, by-the-numbers approach. It could have been so much more. The story features four outcast girls (the sad, pouting Robin Tunney, the 29-year-old Rachel True, the mightily-boobed Neve Campbell, and the absolutely dee-lish Fairuza Balk) who come together to invoke the spirit of Manon (as sort-of universal deity with unlimited power) in order to satisfy their petty desires. Low-wattage drama with not one shred of an epic moment follows. I liked this film when I saw it in the cinema as a teenager, mainly because of the yummy girls. As an adult I can see that the film has lots of lame dialogue, bad editing, and poor photography. Revenge fantasies, especially for high school kids, are clich&eacute;d and old-fashioned as well as being dangerous. There's not much reason to watch this other than ogling the skin on show. Why this got an R-rating is beyond me. Apparently the MPAA regarded the witchcraft to be dangerous and insisted on an R when the film is clearly no harder than a PG-13. I think this is absolutely moronic. With their logic Harry Potter and Charmed should be for adults only.

    "Clueless meets Carrie", and "a slick, hip, smart arse movie," are what the critics allegedly call the movie (or so the back of the box says. For all we know the quote could have been "it is not a slick  movie"). I have not seen Carrie (as of the time of writing), but The Craft is nothing like Clueless, nor is it slick, hip, or smart arse. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't one that catapults to the top of excellence either. The Craft is about a girl who moves to Los Angeles and goes to a Catholic School. She begins as an outcast because she is new, and is pushed even further out when she refuses to go to bed with Chris, the school stud. As such she ends up joining with the school's misfits who are rumoured to be witches. They are actually witches, but they need a forth person to make their power work, and Sarah, the new kid, happens to be the perfect forth person. They claim to worship the god Mamoun, who is basically all of nature. They claim that Mamoun is older than any other god and is the only true god. God was only created by mankind who chose to ignore Mamoun. This I dispute because I believe Mamoun was created by man who did not want to worship the true God. Mamoun is nature while God is beyond nature as he created nature and as such expects us to look after it. Mamoun bestows these girls with magical powers, but whatever these girls do is revisited upon them three times. Sarah wants to get back at Chris so makes him fall in love with her, but this love spell backfires and she cannot get away from him. He is so madly in love with her that his sexual urges are fired up to the point where he is do anything to have sex with her, including raping her. Danny becomes corrupted by the power that she works with. She is little more than white trash, living in a small house with quarrelling parents. She wants out anyway she can so she basically asks for the power of Mamoun, but after somebody close to them dies Sarah wants out and Danny will not let her. This movie is about how power corrupts people if one is not careful. The one that was corrupted the most was the one that had the least. As such it seems that it is attacking the rags to riches philosophy. Those who are poor and powerless are that way because they do not know how to handle power. This is not always the case though because some poor people rise to power and are remembered for their goodness, while others who are born rich are intensely corrupt and abuse their power constantly. My friends rave about this movie, but I don't think that it is that great. It is just fancy effects and magic in the modern time with a pretty simple plot. The plot itself does not grab me and the characters have little depth. They are simply unpopular people who really want to become popular, and there is little else to them. Thus, unfortunately, is the way people are anyway.

    Effective 90's teen-oriented horror told from the perspective of young women, and how they are able to use witchcraft to affect changes in people, places, and things. At first, it's all in good fun, and they're having a high old time, but naturally before long things just get way out of hand. Sarah (Robin Tunney) is a shy, troubled girl with innate supernatural abilities who becomes part of a very small clique of outsiders: Rochelle (Rachel True), Bonnie (Neve Campbell), and Nancy (Fairuza Balk). It's interesting to note that as their powers grow, they really start to blossom, especially Bonnie, although this of course isn't necessarily for the better. Co- screenwriter and director Andrew Fleming ("Bad Dreams", "Threesome", "Dick") gets engaging performances out of his star quartet, with Balk very much dominating the proceedings as a girl desperate to put her trailer trash existence behind her, and who ultimately becomes completely unhinged. Good supporting performances by Assumpta Serna, as the helpful Lirio, owner of the shop that the girls frequent, Christine Taylor, as the stuck up Laura whose blatant racism towards Rochelle results in a fairly interesting comeuppance, and the amusing Skeet Ulrich, Campbell's co-star in "Scream" from the same year, as the initially unfeeling jock who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she casts a spell on him. Cliff De Young is barely seen and under utilized as Sarah's dad, but his fellow veteran Helen Shaver has one of the more unlikely roles of her career (not that she doesn't do a great job) as Nancy's mother. This kind of story could easily descend into a cheese fest but in this instance it's actually very well done, with a decidedly dark tone in its later parts, so it can definitely be taken seriously, with a final act full of creepy crawlies - snakes, scorpions, spiders, rats, etc. - and some genuinely effective atmosphere, leading to a reasonably intense confrontation between protagonist and antagonist. Commendably, Lirio asserts the idea that magic isn't necessarily "black" or "good" but that it largely depends on the individual, so this movie at least isn't going for the usual clich&eacute;s when it comes to this sort of thing. A good, entertaining, intriguing movie with a punchy wrap-up, "The Craft" provides a fine showcase for its attractive young actresses and is overall worth a look. Seven out of 10.

    Although it looks like those cheap and hastily made, straight-to-DVD films, it was actually good to watch. Nothing groundbreaking, but quite good for a night home. It did have a story behind it ( troubled teenagers, dysfunctional families, social prejudices), it did have some acting (where I thought there would be nothing but sleazy chicks that try to make an impression). The filming was good, too. Intense and tight. At some points it was a real thriller. Not gore or something, but quite disturbing. Better than some block busters. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

    When written on paper you know the structure of this story. Girl makes friends at a High School, as time goes on they discover that they can make things happen, they abuse the power, girl from beginning backs down while the leader of the group goes insane, the conflict is resolved. Now I have just explained to you the basic plot. My one biggest beef with the movie is Robin Tunney, she can't act. She delivers the lines almost as if she is bored. Fairuza Balk on the other hand is by far the best thing about this movie. If you've seen her in enough roles (and I have) the name Fairuza Balk is almost a selling point. If only they got someone as talented as her to replace Robin Tunney. This movie is worth a watch. The Story is a good idea (even if it isn't original) and so is the performance by Fairuza Balk but that is around about it.

At first, it's all in good fun, and they're having a high old time, but naturally before long things just get way out of hand. Sarah (Robin Tunney) is a shy, troubled girl with innate supernatural abilities who becomes part of a very small clique of outsiders: Rochelle (Rachel True), Bonnie (Neve Campbell), and Nancy (Fairuza Balk). It's interesting to note that as their powers grow, they really start to blossom, especially Bonnie, although this of course isn't necessarily for the better. Co- screenwriter and director Andrew Fleming ("Bad Dreams", "Threesome", "Dick") gets engaging performances out of his star quartet, with Balk very much dominating the proceedings as a girl desperate to put her trailer trash existence behind her, and who ultimately becomes completely unhinged. Good supporting performances by Assumpta Serna, as the helpful Lirio, owner of the shop that the girls frequent, Christine Taylor, as the stuck up Laura whose blatant racism towards Rochelle results in a fairly interesting comeuppance, and the amusing Skeet Ulrich, Campbell's co-star in "Scream" from the same year, as the initially unfeeling jock who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she casts a spell on him. Cliff De Young is barely seen and under utilized as Sarah's dad, but his fellow veteran Helen Shaver has one of the more unlikely roles of her career (not that she doesn't do a great job) as Nancy's mother. This kind of story could easily descend into a cheese fest but in this instance it's actually very well done, with a decidedly dark tone in its later parts, so it can definitely be taken seriously, with a final act full of creepy crawlies - snakes, scorpions, spiders, rats, etc. - and some genuinely effective atmosphere, leading to a reasonably intense confrontation between protagonist and antagonist. Commendably, Lirio asserts the idea that magic isn't necessarily "black" or "good" but that it largely depends on the individual, so this movie at least isn't going for the usual clich&eacute;s when it comes to this sort of thing. A good, entertaining, intriguing movie with a punchy wrap-up, "The Craft" provides a fine showcase for its attractive young actresses and is overall worth a look. Seven out of 10.

    Although it looks like those cheap and hastily made, straight-to-DVD films, it was actually good to watch. Nothing groundbreaking, but quite good for a night home. It did have a story behind it ( troubled teenagers, dysfunctional families, social prejudices), it did have some acting (where I thought there would be nothing but sleazy chicks that try to make an impression). The filming was good, too. Intense and tight. At some points it was a real thriller. Not gore or something, but quite disturbing. Better than some block busters. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

    When written on paper you know the structure of this story. Girl makes friends at a High School, as time goes on they discover that they can make things happen, they abuse the power, girl from beginning backs down while the leader of the group goes insane, the conflict is resolved. Now I have just explained to you the basic plot. My one biggest beef with the movie is Robin Tunney, she can't act. She delivers the lines almost as if she is bored. Fairuza Balk on the other hand is by far the best thing about this movie. If you've seen her in enough roles (and I have) the name Fairuza Balk is almost a selling point. If only they got someone as talented as her to replace Robin Tunney. This movie is worth a watch. The Story is a good idea (even if it isn't original) and so is the performance by Fairuza Balk but that is around about it.

    Okay, first off I need to more or less shed some light on how I first watched this film. I first saw it when I was 13. I absolutely hated it. If you asked me "does The Craft rate on your bottom 20 films?" I would've answered with "Yes." I almost forgot about this movie until the start of this year when my brother sat me through Return To Oz. I more or less fell in love with Fairuza Balk's acting ability and due to that and the fact that I loved a film that runs along similar lines (Ginger Snaps) I decided it needs to be re-watched and to be honest, it wasn't bad. Okay, I have to say something about the acting. Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and even Rachel True put in solid enough performances but out of the three of them Fairuza feels like she is the only one really given any material to shine in. Unfortunately, as well, Robin Tunney was in the lead role and to pull off this specific role requires a great actress and Tunney was terrible. My mother introduced me to this movie, she loved it but even she had to admit that Tunney was awful. The plot; Three Wicca girls are awaiting a fourth member to join their group because they can't practice real magic without someone to back them up. Along comes Sarah Bailey, a girl who is a "natural witch". The three win her affections and become friends. They soon start practicing magic together after they describe their God; Manon. They all use spells to get back at people that have angered them; Nancy kills her father, Sarah makes a boy that used her actually love her, Bonnie removes the scars on her back, Rochelle makes the hair fall out of a popular girl who gave her sh!t. Soon the leader, Nancy organizes a ritual where she would be given the power of Manon. It succeeds but soon everything goes out of balance and Sarah has to find a way to stop it. Okay, this film is not perfect. The one thing that needed a bit more time is the script. If only Peter Filardi and Andrew Fleming had one more draft to work with. Just one more, I bet this film could've been an 8/10. I have given 8/10's to films with horrible acting before (Star Wars: Episode III) and I would go so far as to say that Tunney is the only problem besides the script so I would even say a 9. The visual style of this film is rather interesting to watch. While I have seen better cinematography and special effects, this film has enough "realism" to them to make me turn off "Oh yeah, Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie are flying into Sarah's room, trying to terrify her" which is rather interesting considering I was only born this film was made and when I go to see a film made today and look at its visuals, I can't turn off because it is so obviously fake. I suppose I was born at the time when the plot was meant to serve the visual effects instead of the other way 'round. Overall this film is a great watch if your thing is a mindless horror film however this is not without its problems.

    When I saw this movie for the first time (in the 90s), I was impressed. I even thought it was a bit scary. Watched it again the other day, and it's still good. But why is this movie tagged as "horror"? That it's definitely not! It's a teen drama -- that's what it is. If you watch it expecting horror, you will be hugely disappointed. It isn't one bit scary; not even creepy. But it IS quite original and entertaining. The characters are very well developed, too. I didn't think the acting was very good, but I've seen worse. Well, I have to say that the movie is very predictable, but it doesn't really spoil it much -- still entertaining. Definitely worth seeing. I've seen it several times; it's one of those movies you can watch periodically and not get tired of.

    Like most movies in Hollywood this one uses the word Witchcraft loosely. There are so many reviews I'm not going to rehash the movie. These girls in no way are practicing any form of witchcraft. Only Wiccans and ritual magicians, etc. call the Corners. Traditional Witchcraft is not like Wicca at all which is a Pagan religion developed by Gardner in the 20th Century. Many believe it is based on the ways of Witchcraft but the differences are like night and day. One must take the movie as totally baseless entertainment. It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror story but is well acted and delivered. All of the young actresses are a little old to be portraying High School students but it didn't detract from the movie at all. I found it amusing when the Mother is trying to explain who Connie Francis is and they walk off uninterested. All in all this movie was well done and anyone who likes the focus of a female dominated major cast will love this movie.

    God, what an awesome movie this is! 1996's "The Craft" is one of those really cool movies from the 90s that they just don't make anymore. The film opens up to a group of teenage witches chanting for a fourth witch to come to them and complete their circle. Then, images of fire and Wiccan symbols fill the screen and the beginning of a cover version of "Tommorrow Never Knows" by Our Lady Peace blasts out at us. As soon as I saw that, I knew this was going to be good. Enters Sara, played by Robin Tunney of "The Mentalist", who is just arriving to a new town and school. There, she meets up with the outcast group of witches who are Nancy (Played by the great Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (played by Neve Campbell of "Scream" fame), and Rochelle (played by Rachel True who gives a convincing performance of being the only black person at her school). While reluctant at first, Sara eventually joins the coven and together they conjure up magic and life is good, at first. Each one wishes for something and they get it but at a cost. Since I don't want to spoil the movie for others, I won't go too much into detail about that. What I will say is "The Craft", while being about teenage girls and obviously being aimed at that group, is a movie that anyone can enjoy. First and foremost, who doesn't love magic and second it deals with the issue of feeling like an outsider and/or being picked on, and just about everyone would fall into one of those categories at least once in their life. Add in a great MTV generation soundtrack and you got yourself "The Craft". Don't miss it.

    Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell, Rachel True, Skeet Ulrich, Christine Taylor and Cliff De Young star in this 1996 horror film. Sarah (Tunney) has just moved to L.A. with her father (De Young) and stepmother. She meets and befriends 3 outcast girls, Nancy (Balk), Bonnie (Campbell) and Rochelle (True) who practice witchcraft to strike back at tormentors. They learn that Sarah is a natural witch and together they perform magic until Nancy becomes power crazy. Ulrich plays Chris, a teen who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she puts a spell on him and Taylor plays Laura, a bimbo teen who is cruel to Rochelle until she gets a spell put on her. This is pretty good and it's funny that Fairuza was a witch 10 years prior in "The Worst Witch." I recommend this.

    Teen angst movies are rarely realistic, and more rarely cast actual teenagers. A gaggle of twenty-somethings working through their collective angst with witchcraft is about as far-fetched as you can get. I'd willing to accept all of this if the film were clever or atmospheric, but it achieves neither, opting for a TV-style, by-the-numbers approach. It could have been so much more. The story features four outcast girls (the sad, pouting Robin Tunney, the 29-year-old Rachel True, the mightily-boobed Neve Campbell, and the absolutely dee-lish Fairuza Balk) who come together to invoke the spirit of Manon (as sort-of universal deity with unlimited power) in order to satisfy their petty desires. Low-wattage drama with not one shred of an epic moment follows. I liked this film when I saw it in the cinema as a teenager, mainly because of the yummy girls. As an adult I can see that the film has lots of lame dialogue, bad editing, and poor photography. Revenge fantasies, especially for high school kids, are clich&eacute;d and old-fashioned as well as being dangerous. There's not much reason to watch this other than ogling the skin on show. Why this got an R-rating is beyond me. Apparently the MPAA regarded the witchcraft to be dangerous and insisted on an R when the film is clearly no harder than a PG-13. I think this is absolutely moronic. With their logic Harry Potter and Charmed should be for adults only.

    "Clueless meets Carrie", and "a slick, hip, smart arse movie," are what the critics allegedly call the movie (or so the back of the box says. For all we know the quote could have been "it is not a slick  movie"). I have not seen Carrie (as of the time of writing), but The Craft is nothing like Clueless, nor is it slick, hip, or smart arse. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't one that catapults to the top of excellence either. The Craft is about a girl who moves to Los Angeles and goes to a Catholic School. She begins as an outcast because she is new, and is pushed even further out when she refuses to go to bed with Chris, the school stud. As such she ends up joining with the school's misfits who are rumoured to be witches. They are actually witches, but they need a forth person to make their power work, and Sarah, the new kid, happens to be the perfect forth person. They claim to worship the god Mamoun, who is basically all of nature. They claim that Mamoun is older than any other god and is the only true god. God was only created by mankind who chose to ignore Mamoun. This I dispute because I believe Mamoun was created by man who did not want to worship the true God. Mamoun is nature while God is beyond nature as he created nature and as such expects us to look after it. Mamoun bestows these girls with magical powers, but whatever these girls do is revisited upon them three times. Sarah wants to get back at Chris so makes him fall in love with her, but this love spell backfires and she cannot get away from him. He is so madly in love with her that his sexual urges are fired up to the point where he is do anything to have sex with her, including raping her. Danny becomes corrupted by the power that she works with. She is little more than white trash, living in a small house with quarrelling parents. She wants out anyway she can so she basically asks for the power of Mamoun, but after somebody close to them dies Sarah wants out and Danny will not let her. This movie is about how power corrupts people if one is not careful. The one that was corrupted the most was the one that had the least. As such it seems that it is attacking the rags to riches philosophy. Those who are poor and powerless are that way because they do not know how to handle power. This is not always the case though because some poor people rise to power and are remembered for their goodness, while others who are born rich are intensely corrupt and abuse their power constantly. My friends rave about this movie, but I don't think that it is that great. It is just fancy effects and magic in the modern time with a pretty simple plot. The plot itself does not grab me and the characters have little depth. They are simply unpopular people who really want to become popular, and there is little else to them. Thus, unfortunately, is the way people are anyway.

I'd willing to accept all of this if the film were clever or atmospheric, but it achieves neither, opting for a TV-style, by-the-numbers approach. It could have been so much more. The story features four outcast girls (the sad, pouting Robin Tunney, the 29-year-old Rachel True, the mightily-boobed Neve Campbell, and the absolutely dee-lish Fairuza Balk) who come together to invoke the spirit of Manon (as sort-of universal deity with unlimited power) in order to satisfy their petty desires. Low-wattage drama with not one shred of an epic moment follows. I liked this film when I saw it in the cinema as a teenager, mainly because of the yummy girls. As an adult I can see that the film has lots of lame dialogue, bad editing, and poor photography. Revenge fantasies, especially for high school kids, are clich&eacute;d and old-fashioned as well as being dangerous. There's not much reason to watch this other than ogling the skin on show. Why this got an R-rating is beyond me. Apparently the MPAA regarded the witchcraft to be dangerous and insisted on an R when the film is clearly no harder than a PG-13. I think this is absolutely moronic. With their logic Harry Potter and Charmed should be for adults only.

    "Clueless meets Carrie", and "a slick, hip, smart arse movie," are what the critics allegedly call the movie (or so the back of the box says. For all we know the quote could have been "it is not a slick  movie"). I have not seen Carrie (as of the time of writing), but The Craft is nothing like Clueless, nor is it slick, hip, or smart arse. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't one that catapults to the top of excellence either. The Craft is about a girl who moves to Los Angeles and goes to a Catholic School. She begins as an outcast because she is new, and is pushed even further out when she refuses to go to bed with Chris, the school stud. As such she ends up joining with the school's misfits who are rumoured to be witches. They are actually witches, but they need a forth person to make their power work, and Sarah, the new kid, happens to be the perfect forth person. They claim to worship the god Mamoun, who is basically all of nature. They claim that Mamoun is older than any other god and is the only true god. God was only created by mankind who chose to ignore Mamoun. This I dispute because I believe Mamoun was created by man who did not want to worship the true God. Mamoun is nature while God is beyond nature as he created nature and as such expects us to look after it. Mamoun bestows these girls with magical powers, but whatever these girls do is revisited upon them three times. Sarah wants to get back at Chris so makes him fall in love with her, but this love spell backfires and she cannot get away from him. He is so madly in love with her that his sexual urges are fired up to the point where he is do anything to have sex with her, including raping her. Danny becomes corrupted by the power that she works with. She is little more than white trash, living in a small house with quarrelling parents. She wants out anyway she can so she basically asks for the power of Mamoun, but after somebody close to them dies Sarah wants out and Danny will not let her. This movie is about how power corrupts people if one is not careful. The one that was corrupted the most was the one that had the least. As such it seems that it is attacking the rags to riches philosophy. Those who are poor and powerless are that way because they do not know how to handle power. This is not always the case though because some poor people rise to power and are remembered for their goodness, while others who are born rich are intensely corrupt and abuse their power constantly. My friends rave about this movie, but I don't think that it is that great. It is just fancy effects and magic in the modern time with a pretty simple plot. The plot itself does not grab me and the characters have little depth. They are simply unpopular people who really want to become popular, and there is little else to them. Thus, unfortunately, is the way people are anyway.

    Effective 90's teen-oriented horror told from the perspective of young women, and how they are able to use witchcraft to affect changes in people, places, and things. At first, it's all in good fun, and they're having a high old time, but naturally before long things just get way out of hand. Sarah (Robin Tunney) is a shy, troubled girl with innate supernatural abilities who becomes part of a very small clique of outsiders: Rochelle (Rachel True), Bonnie (Neve Campbell), and Nancy (Fairuza Balk). It's interesting to note that as their powers grow, they really start to blossom, especially Bonnie, although this of course isn't necessarily for the better. Co- screenwriter and director Andrew Fleming ("Bad Dreams", "Threesome", "Dick") gets engaging performances out of his star quartet, with Balk very much dominating the proceedings as a girl desperate to put her trailer trash existence behind her, and who ultimately becomes completely unhinged. Good supporting performances by Assumpta Serna, as the helpful Lirio, owner of the shop that the girls frequent, Christine Taylor, as the stuck up Laura whose blatant racism towards Rochelle results in a fairly interesting comeuppance, and the amusing Skeet Ulrich, Campbell's co-star in "Scream" from the same year, as the initially unfeeling jock who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she casts a spell on him. Cliff De Young is barely seen and under utilized as Sarah's dad, but his fellow veteran Helen Shaver has one of the more unlikely roles of her career (not that she doesn't do a great job) as Nancy's mother. This kind of story could easily descend into a cheese fest but in this instance it's actually very well done, with a decidedly dark tone in its later parts, so it can definitely be taken seriously, with a final act full of creepy crawlies - snakes, scorpions, spiders, rats, etc. - and some genuinely effective atmosphere, leading to a reasonably intense confrontation between protagonist and antagonist. Commendably, Lirio asserts the idea that magic isn't necessarily "black" or "good" but that it largely depends on the individual, so this movie at least isn't going for the usual clich&eacute;s when it comes to this sort of thing. A good, entertaining, intriguing movie with a punchy wrap-up, "The Craft" provides a fine showcase for its attractive young actresses and is overall worth a look. Seven out of 10.

    Although it looks like those cheap and hastily made, straight-to-DVD films, it was actually good to watch. Nothing groundbreaking, but quite good for a night home. It did have a story behind it ( troubled teenagers, dysfunctional families, social prejudices), it did have some acting (where I thought there would be nothing but sleazy chicks that try to make an impression). The filming was good, too. Intense and tight. At some points it was a real thriller. Not gore or something, but quite disturbing. Better than some block busters. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

    When written on paper you know the structure of this story. Girl makes friends at a High School, as time goes on they discover that they can make things happen, they abuse the power, girl from beginning backs down while the leader of the group goes insane, the conflict is resolved. Now I have just explained to you the basic plot. My one biggest beef with the movie is Robin Tunney, she can't act. She delivers the lines almost as if she is bored. Fairuza Balk on the other hand is by far the best thing about this movie. If you've seen her in enough roles (and I have) the name Fairuza Balk is almost a selling point. If only they got someone as talented as her to replace Robin Tunney. This movie is worth a watch. The Story is a good idea (even if it isn't original) and so is the performance by Fairuza Balk but that is around about it.

    Okay, first off I need to more or less shed some light on how I first watched this film. I first saw it when I was 13. I absolutely hated it. If you asked me "does The Craft rate on your bottom 20 films?" I would've answered with "Yes." I almost forgot about this movie until the start of this year when my brother sat me through Return To Oz. I more or less fell in love with Fairuza Balk's acting ability and due to that and the fact that I loved a film that runs along similar lines (Ginger Snaps) I decided it needs to be re-watched and to be honest, it wasn't bad. Okay, I have to say something about the acting. Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and even Rachel True put in solid enough performances but out of the three of them Fairuza feels like she is the only one really given any material to shine in. Unfortunately, as well, Robin Tunney was in the lead role and to pull off this specific role requires a great actress and Tunney was terrible. My mother introduced me to this movie, she loved it but even she had to admit that Tunney was awful. The plot; Three Wicca girls are awaiting a fourth member to join their group because they can't practice real magic without someone to back them up. Along comes Sarah Bailey, a girl who is a "natural witch". The three win her affections and become friends. They soon start practicing magic together after they describe their God; Manon. They all use spells to get back at people that have angered them; Nancy kills her father, Sarah makes a boy that used her actually love her, Bonnie removes the scars on her back, Rochelle makes the hair fall out of a popular girl who gave her sh!t. Soon the leader, Nancy organizes a ritual where she would be given the power of Manon. It succeeds but soon everything goes out of balance and Sarah has to find a way to stop it. Okay, this film is not perfect. The one thing that needed a bit more time is the script. If only Peter Filardi and Andrew Fleming had one more draft to work with. Just one more, I bet this film could've been an 8/10. I have given 8/10's to films with horrible acting before (Star Wars: Episode III) and I would go so far as to say that Tunney is the only problem besides the script so I would even say a 9. The visual style of this film is rather interesting to watch. While I have seen better cinematography and special effects, this film has enough "realism" to them to make me turn off "Oh yeah, Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie are flying into Sarah's room, trying to terrify her" which is rather interesting considering I was only born this film was made and when I go to see a film made today and look at its visuals, I can't turn off because it is so obviously fake. I suppose I was born at the time when the plot was meant to serve the visual effects instead of the other way 'round. Overall this film is a great watch if your thing is a mindless horror film however this is not without its problems.

    When I saw this movie for the first time (in the 90s), I was impressed. I even thought it was a bit scary. Watched it again the other day, and it's still good. But why is this movie tagged as "horror"? That it's definitely not! It's a teen drama -- that's what it is. If you watch it expecting horror, you will be hugely disappointed. It isn't one bit scary; not even creepy. But it IS quite original and entertaining. The characters are very well developed, too. I didn't think the acting was very good, but I've seen worse. Well, I have to say that the movie is very predictable, but it doesn't really spoil it much -- still entertaining. Definitely worth seeing. I've seen it several times; it's one of those movies you can watch periodically and not get tired of.

    Like most movies in Hollywood this one uses the word Witchcraft loosely. There are so many reviews I'm not going to rehash the movie. These girls in no way are practicing any form of witchcraft. Only Wiccans and ritual magicians, etc. call the Corners. Traditional Witchcraft is not like Wicca at all which is a Pagan religion developed by Gardner in the 20th Century. Many believe it is based on the ways of Witchcraft but the differences are like night and day. One must take the movie as totally baseless entertainment. It is more of a psychological thriller than a horror story but is well acted and delivered. All of the young actresses are a little old to be portraying High School students but it didn't detract from the movie at all. I found it amusing when the Mother is trying to explain who Connie Francis is and they walk off uninterested. All in all this movie was well done and anyone who likes the focus of a female dominated major cast will love this movie.

    God, what an awesome movie this is! 1996's "The Craft" is one of those really cool movies from the 90s that they just don't make anymore. The film opens up to a group of teenage witches chanting for a fourth witch to come to them and complete their circle. Then, images of fire and Wiccan symbols fill the screen and the beginning of a cover version of "Tommorrow Never Knows" by Our Lady Peace blasts out at us. As soon as I saw that, I knew this was going to be good. Enters Sara, played by Robin Tunney of "The Mentalist", who is just arriving to a new town and school. There, she meets up with the outcast group of witches who are Nancy (Played by the great Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (played by Neve Campbell of "Scream" fame), and Rochelle (played by Rachel True who gives a convincing performance of being the only black person at her school). While reluctant at first, Sara eventually joins the coven and together they conjure up magic and life is good, at first. Each one wishes for something and they get it but at a cost. Since I don't want to spoil the movie for others, I won't go too much into detail about that. What I will say is "The Craft", while being about teenage girls and obviously being aimed at that group, is a movie that anyone can enjoy. First and foremost, who doesn't love magic and second it deals with the issue of feeling like an outsider and/or being picked on, and just about everyone would fall into one of those categories at least once in their life. Add in a great MTV generation soundtrack and you got yourself "The Craft". Don't miss it.

    Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell, Rachel True, Skeet Ulrich, Christine Taylor and Cliff De Young star in this 1996 horror film. Sarah (Tunney) has just moved to L.A. with her father (De Young) and stepmother. She meets and befriends 3 outcast girls, Nancy (Balk), Bonnie (Campbell) and Rochelle (True) who practice witchcraft to strike back at tormentors. They learn that Sarah is a natural witch and together they perform magic until Nancy becomes power crazy. Ulrich plays Chris, a teen who becomes obsessed with Sarah after she puts a spell on him and Taylor plays Laura, a bimbo teen who is cruel to Rochelle until she gets a spell put on her. This is pretty good and it's funny that Fairuza was a witch 10 years prior in "The Worst Witch." I recommend this.
