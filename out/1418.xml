    The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women. These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society? This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian- Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase? This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to "put up" with their mothers, who are an "obstacle" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self- hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called "Asian-American experience" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.

    The Joy Luck Club is a film about the relationships between Chinese- American women and their Chinese mothers.It has a cast of Asian-American actresses such as Ming-Na,Rosalind Chao,Lauren Tom,France Nuyen,Tamlyn Tomita,Kieu Chinh,Lisa Lu and Tsai Chin. It is based on the novel of the same title by Amy Tan, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass.The film was directed by Wayne Wang. The film takes place in present-day San Francisco, concentrating on a group of late-middle-aged Chinese women. Ever since arriving in the United States after World War II, the women have gathered weekly to play mah-jongg and to tell stories, regaling each other with tales of their children and grandchildren, giving each other a sense of hope and renewal in the midst of poverty and hardship. The Joy Luck Club is made up of four women -- Suyuan, Lindo, Ying Ying, and An Mei. But when Suyuan dies, the three surviving members invite Suyuan's daughter June to take her place. Along with the daughters of the other members -- Waverly, Lena, and Rose -- June is a Chinese-American with only a passing interest in her rich cultural heritage. But through vignettes that switch back and forth in time, the daughters begin to appreciate the struggles of their mothers to start their families in the optimistic promise of the United States. The movie gives refreshing -- and bittersweet -- dimension to the age- old clash between generations.Four different actresses play the aunties in their youth, which sometimes keeps us struggling to keep the stories straight. That we do is a tribute about the miscommunication that separates one generation from another.Also,it is one of the most touching and moving films ever released on screen that it deserves every tear it wrenches from your eyes.Most of all,it is a great adaptation of a best-selling novel.

    I really liked this movie and showed it to my Culture and Communication class. My students, who are mostly Chinese, also seemed to really enjoy the film! I think that movie does a good job of showing the connections between generations and how we learn our culture, as it is passed down from grandparent to child to grandchild etc... The movie also deals with the theme of identity. Who are we? Who am I? Am I Chinese? Am I American? Am I a murderer? Am I a good mother? So many questions raised in a well-constructed way. I especially appreciated the scene when the American guy is at dinner, and he offends the whole family because of the different cultural expectations that he simply don't realize. These kinds of moments really ring true, and the audience, my self and my students, had discussed such types of scenarios before the movie, so this really stood out!

    I was assigned to read The Joy Luck Club for this year's book report, but I was informed by several people that The Joy Luck Club was a movie, too! Not only that, but it was a classic, apparently! I can't believe I didn't know that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. Like a prologue before I start with the book itself. I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment. Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love. I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it. Maybe next time. I hope that the book catches my attention more.

    Amy Tan's bestselling novel has been adapted for the big screen into a respectable but artless melodrama, tracing in a colorful anthology of flashbacks during a family reunion in San Francisco the often-tragic lives of four Chinese women and their adult daughters. The cultural differences separating each of the quartet of traditional Chinese elders from their modern American children give each episode a special poignancy, but while criss-crossing two hemispheres and three generations the film is forced to lean too heavily (out of necessity) on the crutch of constant voice-over narration, presumably quoted straight out of the book. It looks and sounds at times too much like a well-produced television drama (full screen VHS and DVD versions were 'formatted to fit your TV screen', to no real noticeable effect). In fact the film might have worked better had it actually been expanded into a mini-series. Each of the separate relationships deserves a full movie by itself, and cramming so many memorable biographies (by so many different narrators) into a single two-hour movie only dilutes the emotional impact of each story.

    This movie was one of the first successful Hollywood movies that featured mostly Asian American characters. However, years from now it will ultimately end up seen in a negative light. This movie perpetuates White Knight archetypes along the same veins as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, and even Avatar, in which White males are positioned as the saviors for (backwards) foreigners. The author Amy Tan is a self-loathing, Uncle Tom writer. She never lived in Asia, exoticizes Chinese and Asian cultures, and improperly interprets Chinese terms and behaviors in all of her works. Her core reader demographic are White Americans who enjoy consuming self-righteous or superiority complex attitudes toward other cultures. Amy Tan, and other "White worshiping" Asian Americans like her (like Michelle Malkin), ultimately enjoy success and acceptance in America by pandering, or by demonizing Asian males. In terms of other identity or 2nd-generation American immigrant movies, one hardly sees Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, or other males portrayed in movies/books as negatively as Amy Tan portrays Asian males in all of her works. It also perpetuates damaging (and false) stereotypes regarding Asians and gender roles. When one looks at 2nd class status in Western religions, the lives of American women during the same time period, or the lower percentages of women in current political or corporate offices in America compared to China, the damaging stereotypes seem even more absurd.

    Against the backdrop of a raucous yet emotional "going away" party for a Chinese-American woman named June-Mei Woo (Ming-Na Wen), the wonderful and bittersweet stories of 8 women, 4 Chinese-born and 4 American born, are spun in splendor. June is preparing to depart from her home in San Francisco to China to meet 2 older sisters she has never seen before. The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother. Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin). But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being "Chinese". Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again. Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories. But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again. But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true. The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as "too corny" or "just another chick flick". Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

    The Joy Luck Club shows writers the commercial and critical success that is possible by using the structures and techniques of advanced screen writing. I have long argued that the old 3-act structure is too elementary for anyone wanting to write a mainstream Hollywood script that will actually sell. Trying to write an advanced film like The Joy Luck Club with it would be laughable. Here is a film that tells the story of eight women over the course of approximately sixty years. Does this film have three acts with plot twists on page 27 and page 87? Of course not. You could try to impose such a system - and I'm sure someone will - but what good would it do? The 3-act structure was never designed to help writers create a script. Its main use has been in demarcating a script after it's written. To see how this film is put together - and how you might write a film like it - we have to look at how the seven steps of every story interact with advanced structures. Every good story is founded on seven dramatic steps: problem/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Sure enough, the first thing we notice when exploring the structure of The Joy Luck Club is that each of the eight stories works through the seven steps. Clearly some of the stories in the film fulfill the seven steps better than others. In general I found the mothers' stories more compelling than the daughters'. That may be due in part to the nature of history and geography. The mothers' stories take place in a brutally patriarchal China that is going through vast social and political upheaval. As a result, the mothers' stories have an epic canvas, and the problems these women face are more tragic and profound. The daughters, on the other hand, face the problems of the affluent American, of what has also been called the "end of history." Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these "modern" women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter. Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag. To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures. Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose. The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is: how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time. The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.

    All this mystification expressed over why this flick wasn't considered for an Oscar is, in itself, a bit mystifying. While it wouldn't have been the first time Hollywood recognized what is essentially a tawdry melodrama in that fashion, let's not confuse a bloated, ineptly manipulative movie with great art. It LOOKS great, though. Very high production values with great costumes and beautiful period sets. And the cinematography is gorgeous. All at the service of... ? A convoluted story, put in the hands of people that seem to have no idea how to tell it. Some good actors involved, though, gamely trying to make something of execrable material.

    The story comes after a death and a reunion that bring the past back in all of its undiluted passion, and shows how the present, too, is made, how children who think they are worlds apart are inextricably influenced by the lives of their parents. Wayne Wang's touching film, based on Amy Tan's novel, is about four women, who were born in China and later came to America, and their daughters. Among these eight women mingle countless friends and relatives, to the mise-en-scene's maximum scenery capacity, in peripheral branches of life. Actually, those scenes are the biggest weaknesses of the film, as their interjecting party jest is so transparently scripted that we want only the bottom line of the scenes. But what is about to be dissolved are the beginnings of the women, the stories of how they were born and grew up in a time and culture so far apart from the one in which they live now. The club of the title is a circle of elderly Chinese ladies who meet weekly to play mah jong, and trade stories of their families and grandchildren. All have made ruinous paths from pre- revolutionary China to the privileged homes in San Francisco where they meet. But those old days are not frequently talked about, and often the entire reality of them is not revealed. In a framework of flashbacks, the secrets and stories of all four of the "aunties" are unraveled. We see that the China of the 1930s and 1940s, before the Revolution, was an inconceivably dissimilar world than it is today. Women were not considered too much. Those with resilient spirits and wills were regarded even less than the impressionable, submissive ones. Life was worthless, no more than in wartime. A mother's ability to love her children was doubted. In plenty of instances, all-consuming dilemmas from those hard days still find their echoes in succeeding generations: The potent reality of Amy Tan's story is the lack of understanding between cultures that make the capability of the mothers to identify with their westernized daughters rely on things that have never been clearly vocalized. How, in one instance, could the narrator's mother have told of deserting her first-born twin girls by the roadside? Her mother, ill and emaciated, was certain she should die, and believed her girls would have a better likelihood of living if they were not compromised by the "bad luck" of a deceased mother. Other stories are just as, if not more, agonizing to Americanized ears. There is the auntie who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man, and when she gives birth to the son he wished for so much, the child is taken from her by the second wife. In America, the mothers find it difficult to get their minds around the paths their daughters are taking. Some marry whites, who have deplorable etiquette. They move out of the old neighborhood into houses that seem too cutting-edge and frigid. One daughter gives up on ever pleasing her mother, who carps on everything she does. This movie was produced by Oliver Stone, who himself at one time was an astute and scrappy filmmaker who turned out films with cross-cultural themes like this one, such as his Vietnam trilogy, and Joy Luck's director Wang leaves us longing for the rawness of those films, but he captures Tan's story and keeps it pure within his medium. Her story is as respects Chinese and Chinese-American characters, but their stories are all-inclusive. Anyone, everyone, can relate to how the expectations of one generation can become both the obstructions and the awakenings of the next.

    I really liked this movie and showed it to my Culture and Communication class. My students, who are mostly Chinese, also seemed to really enjoy the film! I think that movie does a good job of showing the connections between generations and how we learn our culture, as it is passed down from grandparent to child to grandchild etc... The movie also deals with the theme of identity. Who are we? Who am I? Am I Chinese? Am I American? Am I a murderer? Am I a good mother? So many questions raised in a well-constructed way. I especially appreciated the scene when the American guy is at dinner, and he offends the whole family because of the different cultural expectations that he simply don't realize. These kinds of moments really ring true, and the audience, my self and my students, had discussed such types of scenarios before the movie, so this really stood out!

    I was assigned to read The Joy Luck Club for this year's book report, but I was informed by several people that The Joy Luck Club was a movie, too! Not only that, but it was a classic, apparently! I can't believe I didn't know that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. Like a prologue before I start with the book itself. I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment. Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love. I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it. Maybe next time. I hope that the book catches my attention more.

    Amy Tan's bestselling novel has been adapted for the big screen into a respectable but artless melodrama, tracing in a colorful anthology of flashbacks during a family reunion in San Francisco the often-tragic lives of four Chinese women and their adult daughters. The cultural differences separating each of the quartet of traditional Chinese elders from their modern American children give each episode a special poignancy, but while criss-crossing two hemispheres and three generations the film is forced to lean too heavily (out of necessity) on the crutch of constant voice-over narration, presumably quoted straight out of the book. It looks and sounds at times too much like a well-produced television drama (full screen VHS and DVD versions were 'formatted to fit your TV screen', to no real noticeable effect). In fact the film might have worked better had it actually been expanded into a mini-series. Each of the separate relationships deserves a full movie by itself, and cramming so many memorable biographies (by so many different narrators) into a single two-hour movie only dilutes the emotional impact of each story.

    This movie was one of the first successful Hollywood movies that featured mostly Asian American characters. However, years from now it will ultimately end up seen in a negative light. This movie perpetuates White Knight archetypes along the same veins as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, and even Avatar, in which White males are positioned as the saviors for (backwards) foreigners. The author Amy Tan is a self-loathing, Uncle Tom writer. She never lived in Asia, exoticizes Chinese and Asian cultures, and improperly interprets Chinese terms and behaviors in all of her works. Her core reader demographic are White Americans who enjoy consuming self-righteous or superiority complex attitudes toward other cultures. Amy Tan, and other "White worshiping" Asian Americans like her (like Michelle Malkin), ultimately enjoy success and acceptance in America by pandering, or by demonizing Asian males. In terms of other identity or 2nd-generation American immigrant movies, one hardly sees Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, or other males portrayed in movies/books as negatively as Amy Tan portrays Asian males in all of her works. It also perpetuates damaging (and false) stereotypes regarding Asians and gender roles. When one looks at 2nd class status in Western religions, the lives of American women during the same time period, or the lower percentages of women in current political or corporate offices in America compared to China, the damaging stereotypes seem even more absurd.

    Against the backdrop of a raucous yet emotional "going away" party for a Chinese-American woman named June-Mei Woo (Ming-Na Wen), the wonderful and bittersweet stories of 8 women, 4 Chinese-born and 4 American born, are spun in splendor. June is preparing to depart from her home in San Francisco to China to meet 2 older sisters she has never seen before. The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother. Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin). But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being "Chinese". Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again. Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories. But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again. But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true. The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as "too corny" or "just another chick flick". Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

    The Joy Luck Club shows writers the commercial and critical success that is possible by using the structures and techniques of advanced screen writing. I have long argued that the old 3-act structure is too elementary for anyone wanting to write a mainstream Hollywood script that will actually sell. Trying to write an advanced film like The Joy Luck Club with it would be laughable. Here is a film that tells the story of eight women over the course of approximately sixty years. Does this film have three acts with plot twists on page 27 and page 87? Of course not. You could try to impose such a system - and I'm sure someone will - but what good would it do? The 3-act structure was never designed to help writers create a script. Its main use has been in demarcating a script after it's written. To see how this film is put together - and how you might write a film like it - we have to look at how the seven steps of every story interact with advanced structures. Every good story is founded on seven dramatic steps: problem/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Sure enough, the first thing we notice when exploring the structure of The Joy Luck Club is that each of the eight stories works through the seven steps. Clearly some of the stories in the film fulfill the seven steps better than others. In general I found the mothers' stories more compelling than the daughters'. That may be due in part to the nature of history and geography. The mothers' stories take place in a brutally patriarchal China that is going through vast social and political upheaval. As a result, the mothers' stories have an epic canvas, and the problems these women face are more tragic and profound. The daughters, on the other hand, face the problems of the affluent American, of what has also been called the "end of history." Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these "modern" women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter. Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag. To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures. Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose. The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is: how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time. The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.

    All this mystification expressed over why this flick wasn't considered for an Oscar is, in itself, a bit mystifying. While it wouldn't have been the first time Hollywood recognized what is essentially a tawdry melodrama in that fashion, let's not confuse a bloated, ineptly manipulative movie with great art. It LOOKS great, though. Very high production values with great costumes and beautiful period sets. And the cinematography is gorgeous. All at the service of... ? A convoluted story, put in the hands of people that seem to have no idea how to tell it. Some good actors involved, though, gamely trying to make something of execrable material.

    The story comes after a death and a reunion that bring the past back in all of its undiluted passion, and shows how the present, too, is made, how children who think they are worlds apart are inextricably influenced by the lives of their parents. Wayne Wang's touching film, based on Amy Tan's novel, is about four women, who were born in China and later came to America, and their daughters. Among these eight women mingle countless friends and relatives, to the mise-en-scene's maximum scenery capacity, in peripheral branches of life. Actually, those scenes are the biggest weaknesses of the film, as their interjecting party jest is so transparently scripted that we want only the bottom line of the scenes. But what is about to be dissolved are the beginnings of the women, the stories of how they were born and grew up in a time and culture so far apart from the one in which they live now. The club of the title is a circle of elderly Chinese ladies who meet weekly to play mah jong, and trade stories of their families and grandchildren. All have made ruinous paths from pre- revolutionary China to the privileged homes in San Francisco where they meet. But those old days are not frequently talked about, and often the entire reality of them is not revealed. In a framework of flashbacks, the secrets and stories of all four of the "aunties" are unraveled. We see that the China of the 1930s and 1940s, before the Revolution, was an inconceivably dissimilar world than it is today. Women were not considered too much. Those with resilient spirits and wills were regarded even less than the impressionable, submissive ones. Life was worthless, no more than in wartime. A mother's ability to love her children was doubted. In plenty of instances, all-consuming dilemmas from those hard days still find their echoes in succeeding generations: The potent reality of Amy Tan's story is the lack of understanding between cultures that make the capability of the mothers to identify with their westernized daughters rely on things that have never been clearly vocalized. How, in one instance, could the narrator's mother have told of deserting her first-born twin girls by the roadside? Her mother, ill and emaciated, was certain she should die, and believed her girls would have a better likelihood of living if they were not compromised by the "bad luck" of a deceased mother. Other stories are just as, if not more, agonizing to Americanized ears. There is the auntie who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man, and when she gives birth to the son he wished for so much, the child is taken from her by the second wife. In America, the mothers find it difficult to get their minds around the paths their daughters are taking. Some marry whites, who have deplorable etiquette. They move out of the old neighborhood into houses that seem too cutting-edge and frigid. One daughter gives up on ever pleasing her mother, who carps on everything she does. This movie was produced by Oliver Stone, who himself at one time was an astute and scrappy filmmaker who turned out films with cross-cultural themes like this one, such as his Vietnam trilogy, and Joy Luck's director Wang leaves us longing for the rawness of those films, but he captures Tan's story and keeps it pure within his medium. Her story is as respects Chinese and Chinese-American characters, but their stories are all-inclusive. Anyone, everyone, can relate to how the expectations of one generation can become both the obstructions and the awakenings of the next.

    The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women. These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society? This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian- Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase? This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to "put up" with their mothers, who are an "obstacle" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self- hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called "Asian-American experience" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.

    The Joy Luck Club is a film about the relationships between Chinese- American women and their Chinese mothers.It has a cast of Asian-American actresses such as Ming-Na,Rosalind Chao,Lauren Tom,France Nuyen,Tamlyn Tomita,Kieu Chinh,Lisa Lu and Tsai Chin. It is based on the novel of the same title by Amy Tan, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass.The film was directed by Wayne Wang. The film takes place in present-day San Francisco, concentrating on a group of late-middle-aged Chinese women. Ever since arriving in the United States after World War II, the women have gathered weekly to play mah-jongg and to tell stories, regaling each other with tales of their children and grandchildren, giving each other a sense of hope and renewal in the midst of poverty and hardship. The Joy Luck Club is made up of four women -- Suyuan, Lindo, Ying Ying, and An Mei. But when Suyuan dies, the three surviving members invite Suyuan's daughter June to take her place. Along with the daughters of the other members -- Waverly, Lena, and Rose -- June is a Chinese-American with only a passing interest in her rich cultural heritage. But through vignettes that switch back and forth in time, the daughters begin to appreciate the struggles of their mothers to start their families in the optimistic promise of the United States. The movie gives refreshing -- and bittersweet -- dimension to the age- old clash between generations.Four different actresses play the aunties in their youth, which sometimes keeps us struggling to keep the stories straight. That we do is a tribute about the miscommunication that separates one generation from another.Also,it is one of the most touching and moving films ever released on screen that it deserves every tear it wrenches from your eyes.Most of all,it is a great adaptation of a best-selling novel.

The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother. Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin). But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being "Chinese". Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again. Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories. But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again. But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true. The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as "too corny" or "just another chick flick". Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

    The Joy Luck Club shows writers the commercial and critical success that is possible by using the structures and techniques of advanced screen writing. I have long argued that the old 3-act structure is too elementary for anyone wanting to write a mainstream Hollywood script that will actually sell. Trying to write an advanced film like The Joy Luck Club with it would be laughable. Here is a film that tells the story of eight women over the course of approximately sixty years. Does this film have three acts with plot twists on page 27 and page 87? Of course not. You could try to impose such a system - and I'm sure someone will - but what good would it do? The 3-act structure was never designed to help writers create a script. Its main use has been in demarcating a script after it's written. To see how this film is put together - and how you might write a film like it - we have to look at how the seven steps of every story interact with advanced structures. Every good story is founded on seven dramatic steps: problem/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Sure enough, the first thing we notice when exploring the structure of The Joy Luck Club is that each of the eight stories works through the seven steps. Clearly some of the stories in the film fulfill the seven steps better than others. In general I found the mothers' stories more compelling than the daughters'. That may be due in part to the nature of history and geography. The mothers' stories take place in a brutally patriarchal China that is going through vast social and political upheaval. As a result, the mothers' stories have an epic canvas, and the problems these women face are more tragic and profound. The daughters, on the other hand, face the problems of the affluent American, of what has also been called the "end of history." Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these "modern" women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter. Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag. To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures. Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose. The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is: how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time. The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.

    All this mystification expressed over why this flick wasn't considered for an Oscar is, in itself, a bit mystifying. While it wouldn't have been the first time Hollywood recognized what is essentially a tawdry melodrama in that fashion, let's not confuse a bloated, ineptly manipulative movie with great art. It LOOKS great, though. Very high production values with great costumes and beautiful period sets. And the cinematography is gorgeous. All at the service of... ? A convoluted story, put in the hands of people that seem to have no idea how to tell it. Some good actors involved, though, gamely trying to make something of execrable material.

    The story comes after a death and a reunion that bring the past back in all of its undiluted passion, and shows how the present, too, is made, how children who think they are worlds apart are inextricably influenced by the lives of their parents. Wayne Wang's touching film, based on Amy Tan's novel, is about four women, who were born in China and later came to America, and their daughters. Among these eight women mingle countless friends and relatives, to the mise-en-scene's maximum scenery capacity, in peripheral branches of life. Actually, those scenes are the biggest weaknesses of the film, as their interjecting party jest is so transparently scripted that we want only the bottom line of the scenes. But what is about to be dissolved are the beginnings of the women, the stories of how they were born and grew up in a time and culture so far apart from the one in which they live now. The club of the title is a circle of elderly Chinese ladies who meet weekly to play mah jong, and trade stories of their families and grandchildren. All have made ruinous paths from pre- revolutionary China to the privileged homes in San Francisco where they meet. But those old days are not frequently talked about, and often the entire reality of them is not revealed. In a framework of flashbacks, the secrets and stories of all four of the "aunties" are unraveled. We see that the China of the 1930s and 1940s, before the Revolution, was an inconceivably dissimilar world than it is today. Women were not considered too much. Those with resilient spirits and wills were regarded even less than the impressionable, submissive ones. Life was worthless, no more than in wartime. A mother's ability to love her children was doubted. In plenty of instances, all-consuming dilemmas from those hard days still find their echoes in succeeding generations: The potent reality of Amy Tan's story is the lack of understanding between cultures that make the capability of the mothers to identify with their westernized daughters rely on things that have never been clearly vocalized. How, in one instance, could the narrator's mother have told of deserting her first-born twin girls by the roadside? Her mother, ill and emaciated, was certain she should die, and believed her girls would have a better likelihood of living if they were not compromised by the "bad luck" of a deceased mother. Other stories are just as, if not more, agonizing to Americanized ears. There is the auntie who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man, and when she gives birth to the son he wished for so much, the child is taken from her by the second wife. In America, the mothers find it difficult to get their minds around the paths their daughters are taking. Some marry whites, who have deplorable etiquette. They move out of the old neighborhood into houses that seem too cutting-edge and frigid. One daughter gives up on ever pleasing her mother, who carps on everything she does. This movie was produced by Oliver Stone, who himself at one time was an astute and scrappy filmmaker who turned out films with cross-cultural themes like this one, such as his Vietnam trilogy, and Joy Luck's director Wang leaves us longing for the rawness of those films, but he captures Tan's story and keeps it pure within his medium. Her story is as respects Chinese and Chinese-American characters, but their stories are all-inclusive. Anyone, everyone, can relate to how the expectations of one generation can become both the obstructions and the awakenings of the next.

    The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women. These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society? This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian- Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase? This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to "put up" with their mothers, who are an "obstacle" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self- hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called "Asian-American experience" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.

    The Joy Luck Club is a film about the relationships between Chinese- American women and their Chinese mothers.It has a cast of Asian-American actresses such as Ming-Na,Rosalind Chao,Lauren Tom,France Nuyen,Tamlyn Tomita,Kieu Chinh,Lisa Lu and Tsai Chin. It is based on the novel of the same title by Amy Tan, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass.The film was directed by Wayne Wang. The film takes place in present-day San Francisco, concentrating on a group of late-middle-aged Chinese women. Ever since arriving in the United States after World War II, the women have gathered weekly to play mah-jongg and to tell stories, regaling each other with tales of their children and grandchildren, giving each other a sense of hope and renewal in the midst of poverty and hardship. The Joy Luck Club is made up of four women -- Suyuan, Lindo, Ying Ying, and An Mei. But when Suyuan dies, the three surviving members invite Suyuan's daughter June to take her place. Along with the daughters of the other members -- Waverly, Lena, and Rose -- June is a Chinese-American with only a passing interest in her rich cultural heritage. But through vignettes that switch back and forth in time, the daughters begin to appreciate the struggles of their mothers to start their families in the optimistic promise of the United States. The movie gives refreshing -- and bittersweet -- dimension to the age- old clash between generations.Four different actresses play the aunties in their youth, which sometimes keeps us struggling to keep the stories straight. That we do is a tribute about the miscommunication that separates one generation from another.Also,it is one of the most touching and moving films ever released on screen that it deserves every tear it wrenches from your eyes.Most of all,it is a great adaptation of a best-selling novel.

    I really liked this movie and showed it to my Culture and Communication class. My students, who are mostly Chinese, also seemed to really enjoy the film! I think that movie does a good job of showing the connections between generations and how we learn our culture, as it is passed down from grandparent to child to grandchild etc... The movie also deals with the theme of identity. Who are we? Who am I? Am I Chinese? Am I American? Am I a murderer? Am I a good mother? So many questions raised in a well-constructed way. I especially appreciated the scene when the American guy is at dinner, and he offends the whole family because of the different cultural expectations that he simply don't realize. These kinds of moments really ring true, and the audience, my self and my students, had discussed such types of scenarios before the movie, so this really stood out!

    I was assigned to read The Joy Luck Club for this year's book report, but I was informed by several people that The Joy Luck Club was a movie, too! Not only that, but it was a classic, apparently! I can't believe I didn't know that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. Like a prologue before I start with the book itself. I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment. Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love. I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it. Maybe next time. I hope that the book catches my attention more.

    Amy Tan's bestselling novel has been adapted for the big screen into a respectable but artless melodrama, tracing in a colorful anthology of flashbacks during a family reunion in San Francisco the often-tragic lives of four Chinese women and their adult daughters. The cultural differences separating each of the quartet of traditional Chinese elders from their modern American children give each episode a special poignancy, but while criss-crossing two hemispheres and three generations the film is forced to lean too heavily (out of necessity) on the crutch of constant voice-over narration, presumably quoted straight out of the book. It looks and sounds at times too much like a well-produced television drama (full screen VHS and DVD versions were 'formatted to fit your TV screen', to no real noticeable effect). In fact the film might have worked better had it actually been expanded into a mini-series. Each of the separate relationships deserves a full movie by itself, and cramming so many memorable biographies (by so many different narrators) into a single two-hour movie only dilutes the emotional impact of each story.

    This movie was one of the first successful Hollywood movies that featured mostly Asian American characters. However, years from now it will ultimately end up seen in a negative light. This movie perpetuates White Knight archetypes along the same veins as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, and even Avatar, in which White males are positioned as the saviors for (backwards) foreigners. The author Amy Tan is a self-loathing, Uncle Tom writer. She never lived in Asia, exoticizes Chinese and Asian cultures, and improperly interprets Chinese terms and behaviors in all of her works. Her core reader demographic are White Americans who enjoy consuming self-righteous or superiority complex attitudes toward other cultures. Amy Tan, and other "White worshiping" Asian Americans like her (like Michelle Malkin), ultimately enjoy success and acceptance in America by pandering, or by demonizing Asian males. In terms of other identity or 2nd-generation American immigrant movies, one hardly sees Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, or other males portrayed in movies/books as negatively as Amy Tan portrays Asian males in all of her works. It also perpetuates damaging (and false) stereotypes regarding Asians and gender roles. When one looks at 2nd class status in Western religions, the lives of American women during the same time period, or the lower percentages of women in current political or corporate offices in America compared to China, the damaging stereotypes seem even more absurd.

June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin). But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being "Chinese".

Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu).

Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these "modern" women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter. Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag. To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures. Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose. The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is: how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time. The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.

    All this mystification expressed over why this flick wasn't considered for an Oscar is, in itself, a bit mystifying. While it wouldn't have been the first time Hollywood recognized what is essentially a tawdry melodrama in that fashion, let's not confuse a bloated, ineptly manipulative movie with great art. It LOOKS great, though. Very high production values with great costumes and beautiful period sets. And the cinematography is gorgeous. All at the service of... ? A convoluted story, put in the hands of people that seem to have no idea how to tell it. Some good actors involved, though, gamely trying to make something of execrable material.

    The story comes after a death and a reunion that bring the past back in all of its undiluted passion, and shows how the present, too, is made, how children who think they are worlds apart are inextricably influenced by the lives of their parents. Wayne Wang's touching film, based on Amy Tan's novel, is about four women, who were born in China and later came to America, and their daughters. Among these eight women mingle countless friends and relatives, to the mise-en-scene's maximum scenery capacity, in peripheral branches of life. Actually, those scenes are the biggest weaknesses of the film, as their interjecting party jest is so transparently scripted that we want only the bottom line of the scenes. But what is about to be dissolved are the beginnings of the women, the stories of how they were born and grew up in a time and culture so far apart from the one in which they live now. The club of the title is a circle of elderly Chinese ladies who meet weekly to play mah jong, and trade stories of their families and grandchildren. All have made ruinous paths from pre- revolutionary China to the privileged homes in San Francisco where they meet. But those old days are not frequently talked about, and often the entire reality of them is not revealed. In a framework of flashbacks, the secrets and stories of all four of the "aunties" are unraveled. We see that the China of the 1930s and 1940s, before the Revolution, was an inconceivably dissimilar world than it is today. Women were not considered too much. Those with resilient spirits and wills were regarded even less than the impressionable, submissive ones. Life was worthless, no more than in wartime. A mother's ability to love her children was doubted. In plenty of instances, all-consuming dilemmas from those hard days still find their echoes in succeeding generations: The potent reality of Amy Tan's story is the lack of understanding between cultures that make the capability of the mothers to identify with their westernized daughters rely on things that have never been clearly vocalized. How, in one instance, could the narrator's mother have told of deserting her first-born twin girls by the roadside? Her mother, ill and emaciated, was certain she should die, and believed her girls would have a better likelihood of living if they were not compromised by the "bad luck" of a deceased mother. Other stories are just as, if not more, agonizing to Americanized ears. There is the auntie who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man, and when she gives birth to the son he wished for so much, the child is taken from her by the second wife. In America, the mothers find it difficult to get their minds around the paths their daughters are taking. Some marry whites, who have deplorable etiquette. They move out of the old neighborhood into houses that seem too cutting-edge and frigid. One daughter gives up on ever pleasing her mother, who carps on everything she does. This movie was produced by Oliver Stone, who himself at one time was an astute and scrappy filmmaker who turned out films with cross-cultural themes like this one, such as his Vietnam trilogy, and Joy Luck's director Wang leaves us longing for the rawness of those films, but he captures Tan's story and keeps it pure within his medium. Her story is as respects Chinese and Chinese-American characters, but their stories are all-inclusive. Anyone, everyone, can relate to how the expectations of one generation can become both the obstructions and the awakenings of the next.

    The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women. These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society? This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian- Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase? This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to "put up" with their mothers, who are an "obstacle" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self- hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called "Asian-American experience" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.

    The Joy Luck Club is a film about the relationships between Chinese- American women and their Chinese mothers.It has a cast of Asian-American actresses such as Ming-Na,Rosalind Chao,Lauren Tom,France Nuyen,Tamlyn Tomita,Kieu Chinh,Lisa Lu and Tsai Chin. It is based on the novel of the same title by Amy Tan, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass.The film was directed by Wayne Wang. The film takes place in present-day San Francisco, concentrating on a group of late-middle-aged Chinese women. Ever since arriving in the United States after World War II, the women have gathered weekly to play mah-jongg and to tell stories, regaling each other with tales of their children and grandchildren, giving each other a sense of hope and renewal in the midst of poverty and hardship. The Joy Luck Club is made up of four women -- Suyuan, Lindo, Ying Ying, and An Mei. But when Suyuan dies, the three surviving members invite Suyuan's daughter June to take her place. Along with the daughters of the other members -- Waverly, Lena, and Rose -- June is a Chinese-American with only a passing interest in her rich cultural heritage. But through vignettes that switch back and forth in time, the daughters begin to appreciate the struggles of their mothers to start their families in the optimistic promise of the United States. The movie gives refreshing -- and bittersweet -- dimension to the age- old clash between generations.Four different actresses play the aunties in their youth, which sometimes keeps us struggling to keep the stories straight. That we do is a tribute about the miscommunication that separates one generation from another.Also,it is one of the most touching and moving films ever released on screen that it deserves every tear it wrenches from your eyes.Most of all,it is a great adaptation of a best-selling novel.

    I really liked this movie and showed it to my Culture and Communication class. My students, who are mostly Chinese, also seemed to really enjoy the film! I think that movie does a good job of showing the connections between generations and how we learn our culture, as it is passed down from grandparent to child to grandchild etc... The movie also deals with the theme of identity. Who are we? Who am I? Am I Chinese? Am I American? Am I a murderer? Am I a good mother? So many questions raised in a well-constructed way. I especially appreciated the scene when the American guy is at dinner, and he offends the whole family because of the different cultural expectations that he simply don't realize. These kinds of moments really ring true, and the audience, my self and my students, had discussed such types of scenarios before the movie, so this really stood out!

    I was assigned to read The Joy Luck Club for this year's book report, but I was informed by several people that The Joy Luck Club was a movie, too! Not only that, but it was a classic, apparently! I can't believe I didn't know that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. Like a prologue before I start with the book itself. I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment. Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love. I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it. Maybe next time. I hope that the book catches my attention more.

    Amy Tan's bestselling novel has been adapted for the big screen into a respectable but artless melodrama, tracing in a colorful anthology of flashbacks during a family reunion in San Francisco the often-tragic lives of four Chinese women and their adult daughters. The cultural differences separating each of the quartet of traditional Chinese elders from their modern American children give each episode a special poignancy, but while criss-crossing two hemispheres and three generations the film is forced to lean too heavily (out of necessity) on the crutch of constant voice-over narration, presumably quoted straight out of the book. It looks and sounds at times too much like a well-produced television drama (full screen VHS and DVD versions were 'formatted to fit your TV screen', to no real noticeable effect). In fact the film might have worked better had it actually been expanded into a mini-series. Each of the separate relationships deserves a full movie by itself, and cramming so many memorable biographies (by so many different narrators) into a single two-hour movie only dilutes the emotional impact of each story.

    This movie was one of the first successful Hollywood movies that featured mostly Asian American characters. However, years from now it will ultimately end up seen in a negative light. This movie perpetuates White Knight archetypes along the same veins as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, and even Avatar, in which White males are positioned as the saviors for (backwards) foreigners. The author Amy Tan is a self-loathing, Uncle Tom writer. She never lived in Asia, exoticizes Chinese and Asian cultures, and improperly interprets Chinese terms and behaviors in all of her works. Her core reader demographic are White Americans who enjoy consuming self-righteous or superiority complex attitudes toward other cultures. Amy Tan, and other "White worshiping" Asian Americans like her (like Michelle Malkin), ultimately enjoy success and acceptance in America by pandering, or by demonizing Asian males. In terms of other identity or 2nd-generation American immigrant movies, one hardly sees Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, or other males portrayed in movies/books as negatively as Amy Tan portrays Asian males in all of her works. It also perpetuates damaging (and false) stereotypes regarding Asians and gender roles. When one looks at 2nd class status in Western religions, the lives of American women during the same time period, or the lower percentages of women in current political or corporate offices in America compared to China, the damaging stereotypes seem even more absurd.

    Against the backdrop of a raucous yet emotional "going away" party for a Chinese-American woman named June-Mei Woo (Ming-Na Wen), the wonderful and bittersweet stories of 8 women, 4 Chinese-born and 4 American born, are spun in splendor. June is preparing to depart from her home in San Francisco to China to meet 2 older sisters she has never seen before. The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother. Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin). But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being "Chinese". Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again. Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories. But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again. But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true. The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as "too corny" or "just another chick flick". Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

    The Joy Luck Club shows writers the commercial and critical success that is possible by using the structures and techniques of advanced screen writing. I have long argued that the old 3-act structure is too elementary for anyone wanting to write a mainstream Hollywood script that will actually sell. Trying to write an advanced film like The Joy Luck Club with it would be laughable. Here is a film that tells the story of eight women over the course of approximately sixty years. Does this film have three acts with plot twists on page 27 and page 87? Of course not. You could try to impose such a system - and I'm sure someone will - but what good would it do? The 3-act structure was never designed to help writers create a script. Its main use has been in demarcating a script after it's written. To see how this film is put together - and how you might write a film like it - we have to look at how the seven steps of every story interact with advanced structures. Every good story is founded on seven dramatic steps: problem/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Sure enough, the first thing we notice when exploring the structure of The Joy Luck Club is that each of the eight stories works through the seven steps. Clearly some of the stories in the film fulfill the seven steps better than others. In general I found the mothers' stories more compelling than the daughters'. That may be due in part to the nature of history and geography. The mothers' stories take place in a brutally patriarchal China that is going through vast social and political upheaval. As a result, the mothers' stories have an epic canvas, and the problems these women face are more tragic and profound. The daughters, on the other hand, face the problems of the affluent American, of what has also been called the "end of history." Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these "modern" women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter. Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag. To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures. Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose. The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is: how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time. The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.

    The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women. These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society? This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian- Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase? This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to "put up" with their mothers, who are an "obstacle" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self- hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called "Asian-American experience" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.

    The Joy Luck Club is a film about the relationships between Chinese- American women and their Chinese mothers.It has a cast of Asian-American actresses such as Ming-Na,Rosalind Chao,Lauren Tom,France Nuyen,Tamlyn Tomita,Kieu Chinh,Lisa Lu and Tsai Chin. It is based on the novel of the same title by Amy Tan, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass.The film was directed by Wayne Wang. The film takes place in present-day San Francisco, concentrating on a group of late-middle-aged Chinese women. Ever since arriving in the United States after World War II, the women have gathered weekly to play mah-jongg and to tell stories, regaling each other with tales of their children and grandchildren, giving each other a sense of hope and renewal in the midst of poverty and hardship. The Joy Luck Club is made up of four women -- Suyuan, Lindo, Ying Ying, and An Mei. But when Suyuan dies, the three surviving members invite Suyuan's daughter June to take her place. Along with the daughters of the other members -- Waverly, Lena, and Rose -- June is a Chinese-American with only a passing interest in her rich cultural heritage. But through vignettes that switch back and forth in time, the daughters begin to appreciate the struggles of their mothers to start their families in the optimistic promise of the United States. The movie gives refreshing -- and bittersweet -- dimension to the age- old clash between generations.Four different actresses play the aunties in their youth, which sometimes keeps us struggling to keep the stories straight. That we do is a tribute about the miscommunication that separates one generation from another.Also,it is one of the most touching and moving films ever released on screen that it deserves every tear it wrenches from your eyes.Most of all,it is a great adaptation of a best-selling novel.

    I really liked this movie and showed it to my Culture and Communication class. My students, who are mostly Chinese, also seemed to really enjoy the film! I think that movie does a good job of showing the connections between generations and how we learn our culture, as it is passed down from grandparent to child to grandchild etc... The movie also deals with the theme of identity. Who are we? Who am I? Am I Chinese? Am I American? Am I a murderer? Am I a good mother? So many questions raised in a well-constructed way. I especially appreciated the scene when the American guy is at dinner, and he offends the whole family because of the different cultural expectations that he simply don't realize. These kinds of moments really ring true, and the audience, my self and my students, had discussed such types of scenarios before the movie, so this really stood out!

    I was assigned to read The Joy Luck Club for this year's book report, but I was informed by several people that The Joy Luck Club was a movie, too! Not only that, but it was a classic, apparently! I can't believe I didn't know that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. Like a prologue before I start with the book itself. I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment. Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love. I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it. Maybe next time. I hope that the book catches my attention more.

    Amy Tan's bestselling novel has been adapted for the big screen into a respectable but artless melodrama, tracing in a colorful anthology of flashbacks during a family reunion in San Francisco the often-tragic lives of four Chinese women and their adult daughters. The cultural differences separating each of the quartet of traditional Chinese elders from their modern American children give each episode a special poignancy, but while criss-crossing two hemispheres and three generations the film is forced to lean too heavily (out of necessity) on the crutch of constant voice-over narration, presumably quoted straight out of the book. It looks and sounds at times too much like a well-produced television drama (full screen VHS and DVD versions were 'formatted to fit your TV screen', to no real noticeable effect). In fact the film might have worked better had it actually been expanded into a mini-series. Each of the separate relationships deserves a full movie by itself, and cramming so many memorable biographies (by so many different narrators) into a single two-hour movie only dilutes the emotional impact of each story.

    This movie was one of the first successful Hollywood movies that featured mostly Asian American characters. However, years from now it will ultimately end up seen in a negative light. This movie perpetuates White Knight archetypes along the same veins as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, and even Avatar, in which White males are positioned as the saviors for (backwards) foreigners. The author Amy Tan is a self-loathing, Uncle Tom writer. She never lived in Asia, exoticizes Chinese and Asian cultures, and improperly interprets Chinese terms and behaviors in all of her works. Her core reader demographic are White Americans who enjoy consuming self-righteous or superiority complex attitudes toward other cultures. Amy Tan, and other "White worshiping" Asian Americans like her (like Michelle Malkin), ultimately enjoy success and acceptance in America by pandering, or by demonizing Asian males. In terms of other identity or 2nd-generation American immigrant movies, one hardly sees Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, or other males portrayed in movies/books as negatively as Amy Tan portrays Asian males in all of her works. It also perpetuates damaging (and false) stereotypes regarding Asians and gender roles. When one looks at 2nd class status in Western religions, the lives of American women during the same time period, or the lower percentages of women in current political or corporate offices in America compared to China, the damaging stereotypes seem even more absurd.

    Against the backdrop of a raucous yet emotional "going away" party for a Chinese-American woman named June-Mei Woo (Ming-Na Wen), the wonderful and bittersweet stories of 8 women, 4 Chinese-born and 4 American born, are spun in splendor. June is preparing to depart from her home in San Francisco to China to meet 2 older sisters she has never seen before. The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother. Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin). But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being "Chinese". Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again. Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories. But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again. But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true. The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as "too corny" or "just another chick flick". Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

    The Joy Luck Club shows writers the commercial and critical success that is possible by using the structures and techniques of advanced screen writing. I have long argued that the old 3-act structure is too elementary for anyone wanting to write a mainstream Hollywood script that will actually sell. Trying to write an advanced film like The Joy Luck Club with it would be laughable. Here is a film that tells the story of eight women over the course of approximately sixty years. Does this film have three acts with plot twists on page 27 and page 87? Of course not. You could try to impose such a system - and I'm sure someone will - but what good would it do? The 3-act structure was never designed to help writers create a script. Its main use has been in demarcating a script after it's written. To see how this film is put together - and how you might write a film like it - we have to look at how the seven steps of every story interact with advanced structures. Every good story is founded on seven dramatic steps: problem/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Sure enough, the first thing we notice when exploring the structure of The Joy Luck Club is that each of the eight stories works through the seven steps. Clearly some of the stories in the film fulfill the seven steps better than others. In general I found the mothers' stories more compelling than the daughters'. That may be due in part to the nature of history and geography. The mothers' stories take place in a brutally patriarchal China that is going through vast social and political upheaval. As a result, the mothers' stories have an epic canvas, and the problems these women face are more tragic and profound. The daughters, on the other hand, face the problems of the affluent American, of what has also been called the "end of history." Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these "modern" women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter. Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag. To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures. Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose. The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is: how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time. The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.

    All this mystification expressed over why this flick wasn't considered for an Oscar is, in itself, a bit mystifying. While it wouldn't have been the first time Hollywood recognized what is essentially a tawdry melodrama in that fashion, let's not confuse a bloated, ineptly manipulative movie with great art. It LOOKS great, though. Very high production values with great costumes and beautiful period sets. And the cinematography is gorgeous. All at the service of... ? A convoluted story, put in the hands of people that seem to have no idea how to tell it. Some good actors involved, though, gamely trying to make something of execrable material.

    The story comes after a death and a reunion that bring the past back in all of its undiluted passion, and shows how the present, too, is made, how children who think they are worlds apart are inextricably influenced by the lives of their parents. Wayne Wang's touching film, based on Amy Tan's novel, is about four women, who were born in China and later came to America, and their daughters. Among these eight women mingle countless friends and relatives, to the mise-en-scene's maximum scenery capacity, in peripheral branches of life. Actually, those scenes are the biggest weaknesses of the film, as their interjecting party jest is so transparently scripted that we want only the bottom line of the scenes. But what is about to be dissolved are the beginnings of the women, the stories of how they were born and grew up in a time and culture so far apart from the one in which they live now. The club of the title is a circle of elderly Chinese ladies who meet weekly to play mah jong, and trade stories of their families and grandchildren. All have made ruinous paths from pre- revolutionary China to the privileged homes in San Francisco where they meet. But those old days are not frequently talked about, and often the entire reality of them is not revealed. In a framework of flashbacks, the secrets and stories of all four of the "aunties" are unraveled. We see that the China of the 1930s and 1940s, before the Revolution, was an inconceivably dissimilar world than it is today. Women were not considered too much. Those with resilient spirits and wills were regarded even less than the impressionable, submissive ones. Life was worthless, no more than in wartime. A mother's ability to love her children was doubted. In plenty of instances, all-consuming dilemmas from those hard days still find their echoes in succeeding generations: The potent reality of Amy Tan's story is the lack of understanding between cultures that make the capability of the mothers to identify with their westernized daughters rely on things that have never been clearly vocalized. How, in one instance, could the narrator's mother have told of deserting her first-born twin girls by the roadside? Her mother, ill and emaciated, was certain she should die, and believed her girls would have a better likelihood of living if they were not compromised by the "bad luck" of a deceased mother. Other stories are just as, if not more, agonizing to Americanized ears. There is the auntie who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man, and when she gives birth to the son he wished for so much, the child is taken from her by the second wife. In America, the mothers find it difficult to get their minds around the paths their daughters are taking. Some marry whites, who have deplorable etiquette. They move out of the old neighborhood into houses that seem too cutting-edge and frigid. One daughter gives up on ever pleasing her mother, who carps on everything she does. This movie was produced by Oliver Stone, who himself at one time was an astute and scrappy filmmaker who turned out films with cross-cultural themes like this one, such as his Vietnam trilogy, and Joy Luck's director Wang leaves us longing for the rawness of those films, but he captures Tan's story and keeps it pure within his medium. Her story is as respects Chinese and Chinese-American characters, but their stories are all-inclusive. Anyone, everyone, can relate to how the expectations of one generation can become both the obstructions and the awakenings of the next.

Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment. Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love. I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it. Maybe next time. I hope that the book catches my attention more.

    Amy Tan's bestselling novel has been adapted for the big screen into a respectable but artless melodrama, tracing in a colorful anthology of flashbacks during a family reunion in San Francisco the often-tragic lives of four Chinese women and their adult daughters. The cultural differences separating each of the quartet of traditional Chinese elders from their modern American children give each episode a special poignancy, but while criss-crossing two hemispheres and three generations the film is forced to lean too heavily (out of necessity) on the crutch of constant voice-over narration, presumably quoted straight out of the book. It looks and sounds at times too much like a well-produced television drama (full screen VHS and DVD versions were 'formatted to fit your TV screen', to no real noticeable effect). In fact the film might have worked better had it actually been expanded into a mini-series. Each of the separate relationships deserves a full movie by itself, and cramming so many memorable biographies (by so many different narrators) into a single two-hour movie only dilutes the emotional impact of each story.

    This movie was one of the first successful Hollywood movies that featured mostly Asian American characters. However, years from now it will ultimately end up seen in a negative light. This movie perpetuates White Knight archetypes along the same veins as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, and even Avatar, in which White males are positioned as the saviors for (backwards) foreigners. The author Amy Tan is a self-loathing, Uncle Tom writer. She never lived in Asia, exoticizes Chinese and Asian cultures, and improperly interprets Chinese terms and behaviors in all of her works. Her core reader demographic are White Americans who enjoy consuming self-righteous or superiority complex attitudes toward other cultures. Amy Tan, and other "White worshiping" Asian Americans like her (like Michelle Malkin), ultimately enjoy success and acceptance in America by pandering, or by demonizing Asian males. In terms of other identity or 2nd-generation American immigrant movies, one hardly sees Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, or other males portrayed in movies/books as negatively as Amy Tan portrays Asian males in all of her works. It also perpetuates damaging (and false) stereotypes regarding Asians and gender roles. When one looks at 2nd class status in Western religions, the lives of American women during the same time period, or the lower percentages of women in current political or corporate offices in America compared to China, the damaging stereotypes seem even more absurd.

    Against the backdrop of a raucous yet emotional "going away" party for a Chinese-American woman named June-Mei Woo (Ming-Na Wen), the wonderful and bittersweet stories of 8 women, 4 Chinese-born and 4 American born, are spun in splendor. June is preparing to depart from her home in San Francisco to China to meet 2 older sisters she has never seen before. The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother. Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin). But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being "Chinese". Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again. Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories. But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again. But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true. The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as "too corny" or "just another chick flick". Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

    The Joy Luck Club shows writers the commercial and critical success that is possible by using the structures and techniques of advanced screen writing. I have long argued that the old 3-act structure is too elementary for anyone wanting to write a mainstream Hollywood script that will actually sell. Trying to write an advanced film like The Joy Luck Club with it would be laughable. Here is a film that tells the story of eight women over the course of approximately sixty years. Does this film have three acts with plot twists on page 27 and page 87? Of course not. You could try to impose such a system - and I'm sure someone will - but what good would it do? The 3-act structure was never designed to help writers create a script. Its main use has been in demarcating a script after it's written. To see how this film is put together - and how you might write a film like it - we have to look at how the seven steps of every story interact with advanced structures. Every good story is founded on seven dramatic steps: problem/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Sure enough, the first thing we notice when exploring the structure of The Joy Luck Club is that each of the eight stories works through the seven steps. Clearly some of the stories in the film fulfill the seven steps better than others. In general I found the mothers' stories more compelling than the daughters'. That may be due in part to the nature of history and geography. The mothers' stories take place in a brutally patriarchal China that is going through vast social and political upheaval. As a result, the mothers' stories have an epic canvas, and the problems these women face are more tragic and profound. The daughters, on the other hand, face the problems of the affluent American, of what has also been called the "end of history." Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these "modern" women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter. Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag. To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures. Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose. The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is: how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time. The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.

    All this mystification expressed over why this flick wasn't considered for an Oscar is, in itself, a bit mystifying. While it wouldn't have been the first time Hollywood recognized what is essentially a tawdry melodrama in that fashion, let's not confuse a bloated, ineptly manipulative movie with great art. It LOOKS great, though. Very high production values with great costumes and beautiful period sets. And the cinematography is gorgeous. All at the service of... ? A convoluted story, put in the hands of people that seem to have no idea how to tell it. Some good actors involved, though, gamely trying to make something of execrable material.

    The story comes after a death and a reunion that bring the past back in all of its undiluted passion, and shows how the present, too, is made, how children who think they are worlds apart are inextricably influenced by the lives of their parents. Wayne Wang's touching film, based on Amy Tan's novel, is about four women, who were born in China and later came to America, and their daughters. Among these eight women mingle countless friends and relatives, to the mise-en-scene's maximum scenery capacity, in peripheral branches of life. Actually, those scenes are the biggest weaknesses of the film, as their interjecting party jest is so transparently scripted that we want only the bottom line of the scenes. But what is about to be dissolved are the beginnings of the women, the stories of how they were born and grew up in a time and culture so far apart from the one in which they live now. The club of the title is a circle of elderly Chinese ladies who meet weekly to play mah jong, and trade stories of their families and grandchildren. All have made ruinous paths from pre- revolutionary China to the privileged homes in San Francisco where they meet. But those old days are not frequently talked about, and often the entire reality of them is not revealed. In a framework of flashbacks, the secrets and stories of all four of the "aunties" are unraveled. We see that the China of the 1930s and 1940s, before the Revolution, was an inconceivably dissimilar world than it is today. Women were not considered too much. Those with resilient spirits and wills were regarded even less than the impressionable, submissive ones. Life was worthless, no more than in wartime. A mother's ability to love her children was doubted. In plenty of instances, all-consuming dilemmas from those hard days still find their echoes in succeeding generations: The potent reality of Amy Tan's story is the lack of understanding between cultures that make the capability of the mothers to identify with their westernized daughters rely on things that have never been clearly vocalized. How, in one instance, could the narrator's mother have told of deserting her first-born twin girls by the roadside? Her mother, ill and emaciated, was certain she should die, and believed her girls would have a better likelihood of living if they were not compromised by the "bad luck" of a deceased mother. Other stories are just as, if not more, agonizing to Americanized ears. There is the auntie who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man, and when she gives birth to the son he wished for so much, the child is taken from her by the second wife. In America, the mothers find it difficult to get their minds around the paths their daughters are taking. Some marry whites, who have deplorable etiquette. They move out of the old neighborhood into houses that seem too cutting-edge and frigid. One daughter gives up on ever pleasing her mother, who carps on everything she does. This movie was produced by Oliver Stone, who himself at one time was an astute and scrappy filmmaker who turned out films with cross-cultural themes like this one, such as his Vietnam trilogy, and Joy Luck's director Wang leaves us longing for the rawness of those films, but he captures Tan's story and keeps it pure within his medium. Her story is as respects Chinese and Chinese-American characters, but their stories are all-inclusive. Anyone, everyone, can relate to how the expectations of one generation can become both the obstructions and the awakenings of the next.

    The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women. These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society? This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian- Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase? This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to "put up" with their mothers, who are an "obstacle" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self- hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called "Asian-American experience" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.

    The Joy Luck Club is a film about the relationships between Chinese- American women and their Chinese mothers.It has a cast of Asian-American actresses such as Ming-Na,Rosalind Chao,Lauren Tom,France Nuyen,Tamlyn Tomita,Kieu Chinh,Lisa Lu and Tsai Chin. It is based on the novel of the same title by Amy Tan, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass.The film was directed by Wayne Wang. The film takes place in present-day San Francisco, concentrating on a group of late-middle-aged Chinese women. Ever since arriving in the United States after World War II, the women have gathered weekly to play mah-jongg and to tell stories, regaling each other with tales of their children and grandchildren, giving each other a sense of hope and renewal in the midst of poverty and hardship. The Joy Luck Club is made up of four women -- Suyuan, Lindo, Ying Ying, and An Mei. But when Suyuan dies, the three surviving members invite Suyuan's daughter June to take her place. Along with the daughters of the other members -- Waverly, Lena, and Rose -- June is a Chinese-American with only a passing interest in her rich cultural heritage. But through vignettes that switch back and forth in time, the daughters begin to appreciate the struggles of their mothers to start their families in the optimistic promise of the United States. The movie gives refreshing -- and bittersweet -- dimension to the age- old clash between generations.Four different actresses play the aunties in their youth, which sometimes keeps us struggling to keep the stories straight. That we do is a tribute about the miscommunication that separates one generation from another.Also,it is one of the most touching and moving films ever released on screen that it deserves every tear it wrenches from your eyes.Most of all,it is a great adaptation of a best-selling novel.

    I really liked this movie and showed it to my Culture and Communication class. My students, who are mostly Chinese, also seemed to really enjoy the film! I think that movie does a good job of showing the connections between generations and how we learn our culture, as it is passed down from grandparent to child to grandchild etc... The movie also deals with the theme of identity. Who are we? Who am I? Am I Chinese? Am I American? Am I a murderer? Am I a good mother? So many questions raised in a well-constructed way. I especially appreciated the scene when the American guy is at dinner, and he offends the whole family because of the different cultural expectations that he simply don't realize. These kinds of moments really ring true, and the audience, my self and my students, had discussed such types of scenarios before the movie, so this really stood out!

    I was assigned to read The Joy Luck Club for this year's book report, but I was informed by several people that The Joy Luck Club was a movie, too! Not only that, but it was a classic, apparently! I can't believe I didn't know that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. Like a prologue before I start with the book itself. I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment. Everyone was also interconnected, somehow.

At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories. But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again. But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true. The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as "too corny" or "just another chick flick". Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

    The Joy Luck Club shows writers the commercial and critical success that is possible by using the structures and techniques of advanced screen writing. I have long argued that the old 3-act structure is too elementary for anyone wanting to write a mainstream Hollywood script that will actually sell. Trying to write an advanced film like The Joy Luck Club with it would be laughable. Here is a film that tells the story of eight women over the course of approximately sixty years. Does this film have three acts with plot twists on page 27 and page 87? Of course not. You could try to impose such a system - and I'm sure someone will - but what good would it do? The 3-act structure was never designed to help writers create a script. Its main use has been in demarcating a script after it's written. To see how this film is put together - and how you might write a film like it - we have to look at how the seven steps of every story interact with advanced structures. Every good story is founded on seven dramatic steps: problem/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Sure enough, the first thing we notice when exploring the structure of The Joy Luck Club is that each of the eight stories works through the seven steps. Clearly some of the stories in the film fulfill the seven steps better than others. In general I found the mothers' stories more compelling than the daughters'. That may be due in part to the nature of history and geography. The mothers' stories take place in a brutally patriarchal China that is going through vast social and political upheaval. As a result, the mothers' stories have an epic canvas, and the problems these women face are more tragic and profound. The daughters, on the other hand, face the problems of the affluent American, of what has also been called the "end of history." Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these "modern" women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter. Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag. To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures. Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose. The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is: how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time. The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.

    All this mystification expressed over why this flick wasn't considered for an Oscar is, in itself, a bit mystifying. While it wouldn't have been the first time Hollywood recognized what is essentially a tawdry melodrama in that fashion, let's not confuse a bloated, ineptly manipulative movie with great art. It LOOKS great, though. Very high production values with great costumes and beautiful period sets. And the cinematography is gorgeous. All at the service of... ? A convoluted story, put in the hands of people that seem to have no idea how to tell it. Some good actors involved, though, gamely trying to make something of execrable material.

    The story comes after a death and a reunion that bring the past back in all of its undiluted passion, and shows how the present, too, is made, how children who think they are worlds apart are inextricably influenced by the lives of their parents. Wayne Wang's touching film, based on Amy Tan's novel, is about four women, who were born in China and later came to America, and their daughters. Among these eight women mingle countless friends and relatives, to the mise-en-scene's maximum scenery capacity, in peripheral branches of life. Actually, those scenes are the biggest weaknesses of the film, as their interjecting party jest is so transparently scripted that we want only the bottom line of the scenes. But what is about to be dissolved are the beginnings of the women, the stories of how they were born and grew up in a time and culture so far apart from the one in which they live now. The club of the title is a circle of elderly Chinese ladies who meet weekly to play mah jong, and trade stories of their families and grandchildren. All have made ruinous paths from pre- revolutionary China to the privileged homes in San Francisco where they meet. But those old days are not frequently talked about, and often the entire reality of them is not revealed. In a framework of flashbacks, the secrets and stories of all four of the "aunties" are unraveled. We see that the China of the 1930s and 1940s, before the Revolution, was an inconceivably dissimilar world than it is today. Women were not considered too much. Those with resilient spirits and wills were regarded even less than the impressionable, submissive ones. Life was worthless, no more than in wartime. A mother's ability to love her children was doubted. In plenty of instances, all-consuming dilemmas from those hard days still find their echoes in succeeding generations: The potent reality of Amy Tan's story is the lack of understanding between cultures that make the capability of the mothers to identify with their westernized daughters rely on things that have never been clearly vocalized. How, in one instance, could the narrator's mother have told of deserting her first-born twin girls by the roadside? Her mother, ill and emaciated, was certain she should die, and believed her girls would have a better likelihood of living if they were not compromised by the "bad luck" of a deceased mother. Other stories are just as, if not more, agonizing to Americanized ears. There is the auntie who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man, and when she gives birth to the son he wished for so much, the child is taken from her by the second wife. In America, the mothers find it difficult to get their minds around the paths their daughters are taking. Some marry whites, who have deplorable etiquette. They move out of the old neighborhood into houses that seem too cutting-edge and frigid. One daughter gives up on ever pleasing her mother, who carps on everything she does. This movie was produced by Oliver Stone, who himself at one time was an astute and scrappy filmmaker who turned out films with cross-cultural themes like this one, such as his Vietnam trilogy, and Joy Luck's director Wang leaves us longing for the rawness of those films, but he captures Tan's story and keeps it pure within his medium. Her story is as respects Chinese and Chinese-American characters, but their stories are all-inclusive. Anyone, everyone, can relate to how the expectations of one generation can become both the obstructions and the awakenings of the next.

    The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women. These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society? This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian- Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase? This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to "put up" with their mothers, who are an "obstacle" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self- hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called "Asian-American experience" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.

    The Joy Luck Club is a film about the relationships between Chinese- American women and their Chinese mothers.It has a cast of Asian-American actresses such as Ming-Na,Rosalind Chao,Lauren Tom,France Nuyen,Tamlyn Tomita,Kieu Chinh,Lisa Lu and Tsai Chin. It is based on the novel of the same title by Amy Tan, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass.The film was directed by Wayne Wang. The film takes place in present-day San Francisco, concentrating on a group of late-middle-aged Chinese women. Ever since arriving in the United States after World War II, the women have gathered weekly to play mah-jongg and to tell stories, regaling each other with tales of their children and grandchildren, giving each other a sense of hope and renewal in the midst of poverty and hardship. The Joy Luck Club is made up of four women -- Suyuan, Lindo, Ying Ying, and An Mei. But when Suyuan dies, the three surviving members invite Suyuan's daughter June to take her place. Along with the daughters of the other members -- Waverly, Lena, and Rose -- June is a Chinese-American with only a passing interest in her rich cultural heritage. But through vignettes that switch back and forth in time, the daughters begin to appreciate the struggles of their mothers to start their families in the optimistic promise of the United States. The movie gives refreshing -- and bittersweet -- dimension to the age- old clash between generations.Four different actresses play the aunties in their youth, which sometimes keeps us struggling to keep the stories straight. That we do is a tribute about the miscommunication that separates one generation from another.Also,it is one of the most touching and moving films ever released on screen that it deserves every tear it wrenches from your eyes.Most of all,it is a great adaptation of a best-selling novel.

    I really liked this movie and showed it to my Culture and Communication class. My students, who are mostly Chinese, also seemed to really enjoy the film! I think that movie does a good job of showing the connections between generations and how we learn our culture, as it is passed down from grandparent to child to grandchild etc... The movie also deals with the theme of identity. Who are we? Who am I? Am I Chinese? Am I American? Am I a murderer? Am I a good mother? So many questions raised in a well-constructed way. I especially appreciated the scene when the American guy is at dinner, and he offends the whole family because of the different cultural expectations that he simply don't realize. These kinds of moments really ring true, and the audience, my self and my students, had discussed such types of scenarios before the movie, so this really stood out!

    I was assigned to read The Joy Luck Club for this year's book report, but I was informed by several people that The Joy Luck Club was a movie, too! Not only that, but it was a classic, apparently! I can't believe I didn't know that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. Like a prologue before I start with the book itself. I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment. Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love. I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it. Maybe next time. I hope that the book catches my attention more.

    Amy Tan's bestselling novel has been adapted for the big screen into a respectable but artless melodrama, tracing in a colorful anthology of flashbacks during a family reunion in San Francisco the often-tragic lives of four Chinese women and their adult daughters. The cultural differences separating each of the quartet of traditional Chinese elders from their modern American children give each episode a special poignancy, but while criss-crossing two hemispheres and three generations the film is forced to lean too heavily (out of necessity) on the crutch of constant voice-over narration, presumably quoted straight out of the book. It looks and sounds at times too much like a well-produced television drama (full screen VHS and DVD versions were 'formatted to fit your TV screen', to no real noticeable effect). In fact the film might have worked better had it actually been expanded into a mini-series. Each of the separate relationships deserves a full movie by itself, and cramming so many memorable biographies (by so many different narrators) into a single two-hour movie only dilutes the emotional impact of each story.

    This movie was one of the first successful Hollywood movies that featured mostly Asian American characters. However, years from now it will ultimately end up seen in a negative light. This movie perpetuates White Knight archetypes along the same veins as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, and even Avatar, in which White males are positioned as the saviors for (backwards) foreigners. The author Amy Tan is a self-loathing, Uncle Tom writer. She never lived in Asia, exoticizes Chinese and Asian cultures, and improperly interprets Chinese terms and behaviors in all of her works. Her core reader demographic are White Americans who enjoy consuming self-righteous or superiority complex attitudes toward other cultures. Amy Tan, and other "White worshiping" Asian Americans like her (like Michelle Malkin), ultimately enjoy success and acceptance in America by pandering, or by demonizing Asian males. In terms of other identity or 2nd-generation American immigrant movies, one hardly sees Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, or other males portrayed in movies/books as negatively as Amy Tan portrays Asian males in all of her works. It also perpetuates damaging (and false) stereotypes regarding Asians and gender roles. When one looks at 2nd class status in Western religions, the lives of American women during the same time period, or the lower percentages of women in current political or corporate offices in America compared to China, the damaging stereotypes seem even more absurd.

    Against the backdrop of a raucous yet emotional "going away" party for a Chinese-American woman named June-Mei Woo (Ming-Na Wen), the wonderful and bittersweet stories of 8 women, 4 Chinese-born and 4 American born, are spun in splendor. June is preparing to depart from her home in San Francisco to China to meet 2 older sisters she has never seen before. The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother. Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin). But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being "Chinese". Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again. Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories. But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again. But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true. The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as "too corny" or "just another chick flick". Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

    All this mystification expressed over why this flick wasn't considered for an Oscar is, in itself, a bit mystifying. While it wouldn't have been the first time Hollywood recognized what is essentially a tawdry melodrama in that fashion, let's not confuse a bloated, ineptly manipulative movie with great art. It LOOKS great, though. Very high production values with great costumes and beautiful period sets. And the cinematography is gorgeous. All at the service of... ? A convoluted story, put in the hands of people that seem to have no idea how to tell it. Some good actors involved, though, gamely trying to make something of execrable material.

    The story comes after a death and a reunion that bring the past back in all of its undiluted passion, and shows how the present, too, is made, how children who think they are worlds apart are inextricably influenced by the lives of their parents. Wayne Wang's touching film, based on Amy Tan's novel, is about four women, who were born in China and later came to America, and their daughters. Among these eight women mingle countless friends and relatives, to the mise-en-scene's maximum scenery capacity, in peripheral branches of life. Actually, those scenes are the biggest weaknesses of the film, as their interjecting party jest is so transparently scripted that we want only the bottom line of the scenes. But what is about to be dissolved are the beginnings of the women, the stories of how they were born and grew up in a time and culture so far apart from the one in which they live now. The club of the title is a circle of elderly Chinese ladies who meet weekly to play mah jong, and trade stories of their families and grandchildren. All have made ruinous paths from pre- revolutionary China to the privileged homes in San Francisco where they meet. But those old days are not frequently talked about, and often the entire reality of them is not revealed. In a framework of flashbacks, the secrets and stories of all four of the "aunties" are unraveled. We see that the China of the 1930s and 1940s, before the Revolution, was an inconceivably dissimilar world than it is today. Women were not considered too much. Those with resilient spirits and wills were regarded even less than the impressionable, submissive ones. Life was worthless, no more than in wartime. A mother's ability to love her children was doubted. In plenty of instances, all-consuming dilemmas from those hard days still find their echoes in succeeding generations: The potent reality of Amy Tan's story is the lack of understanding between cultures that make the capability of the mothers to identify with their westernized daughters rely on things that have never been clearly vocalized. How, in one instance, could the narrator's mother have told of deserting her first-born twin girls by the roadside? Her mother, ill and emaciated, was certain she should die, and believed her girls would have a better likelihood of living if they were not compromised by the "bad luck" of a deceased mother. Other stories are just as, if not more, agonizing to Americanized ears. There is the auntie who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man, and when she gives birth to the son he wished for so much, the child is taken from her by the second wife. In America, the mothers find it difficult to get their minds around the paths their daughters are taking. Some marry whites, who have deplorable etiquette. They move out of the old neighborhood into houses that seem too cutting-edge and frigid. One daughter gives up on ever pleasing her mother, who carps on everything she does. This movie was produced by Oliver Stone, who himself at one time was an astute and scrappy filmmaker who turned out films with cross-cultural themes like this one, such as his Vietnam trilogy, and Joy Luck's director Wang leaves us longing for the rawness of those films, but he captures Tan's story and keeps it pure within his medium. Her story is as respects Chinese and Chinese-American characters, but their stories are all-inclusive. Anyone, everyone, can relate to how the expectations of one generation can become both the obstructions and the awakenings of the next.

    The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women. These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society? This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian- Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase? This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to "put up" with their mothers, who are an "obstacle" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self- hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called "Asian-American experience" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.

    The Joy Luck Club is a film about the relationships between Chinese- American women and their Chinese mothers.It has a cast of Asian-American actresses such as Ming-Na,Rosalind Chao,Lauren Tom,France Nuyen,Tamlyn Tomita,Kieu Chinh,Lisa Lu and Tsai Chin. It is based on the novel of the same title by Amy Tan, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bass.The film was directed by Wayne Wang. The film takes place in present-day San Francisco, concentrating on a group of late-middle-aged Chinese women. Ever since arriving in the United States after World War II, the women have gathered weekly to play mah-jongg and to tell stories, regaling each other with tales of their children and grandchildren, giving each other a sense of hope and renewal in the midst of poverty and hardship. The Joy Luck Club is made up of four women -- Suyuan, Lindo, Ying Ying, and An Mei. But when Suyuan dies, the three surviving members invite Suyuan's daughter June to take her place. Along with the daughters of the other members -- Waverly, Lena, and Rose -- June is a Chinese-American with only a passing interest in her rich cultural heritage. But through vignettes that switch back and forth in time, the daughters begin to appreciate the struggles of their mothers to start their families in the optimistic promise of the United States. The movie gives refreshing -- and bittersweet -- dimension to the age- old clash between generations.Four different actresses play the aunties in their youth, which sometimes keeps us struggling to keep the stories straight. That we do is a tribute about the miscommunication that separates one generation from another.Also,it is one of the most touching and moving films ever released on screen that it deserves every tear it wrenches from your eyes.Most of all,it is a great adaptation of a best-selling novel.

    I really liked this movie and showed it to my Culture and Communication class. My students, who are mostly Chinese, also seemed to really enjoy the film! I think that movie does a good job of showing the connections between generations and how we learn our culture, as it is passed down from grandparent to child to grandchild etc... The movie also deals with the theme of identity. Who are we? Who am I? Am I Chinese? Am I American? Am I a murderer? Am I a good mother? So many questions raised in a well-constructed way. I especially appreciated the scene when the American guy is at dinner, and he offends the whole family because of the different cultural expectations that he simply don't realize. These kinds of moments really ring true, and the audience, my self and my students, had discussed such types of scenarios before the movie, so this really stood out!

    I was assigned to read The Joy Luck Club for this year's book report, but I was informed by several people that The Joy Luck Club was a movie, too! Not only that, but it was a classic, apparently! I can't believe I didn't know that. Anyway, I decided to give it a try. Like a prologue before I start with the book itself. I didn't like the biases that it gave to all of the daughter's husbands. It was like, somehow it showed that all Chinese men were cruel. I'm sure that not EVERY man in China is like that (or are they?)! That biased opinion of men threw me off. I also got confused with all the Chinese names and the many characters, though it was easy to understand the plot of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the hope that it gave. Friendships can last. I'm not sure if I've found friends that would stick with me until I'm old and gray. I can only hope so. This movie shows that it is possible for it to happen. The relationships shown between mothers and daughters were done splendidly. The last scene with June and her mother was sad. Granted, I didn't really feel any emotion, but I could tell somehow that it was supposed to be a heartbreaking moment. Everyone was also interconnected, somehow. It was like watching those romance films like Love Actually or Valentine's Day. The only difference was that the main topic of The Joy Luck Club was about family (specifically mother-daughter) love. I was expecting a lot, due to all the reviews that I've seen/heard. From friends to parents to adults to online reviews-- everyone said it was a great movie and it made them cry! I was wondering why I wasn't crying even in the last 5 minutes of the film. Either something's wrong with me or it's really just the movie. Or maybe it was just the time of the day. I felt that I wasn't concentrating much on it. Maybe next time. I hope that the book catches my attention more.

    Amy Tan's bestselling novel has been adapted for the big screen into a respectable but artless melodrama, tracing in a colorful anthology of flashbacks during a family reunion in San Francisco the often-tragic lives of four Chinese women and their adult daughters. The cultural differences separating each of the quartet of traditional Chinese elders from their modern American children give each episode a special poignancy, but while criss-crossing two hemispheres and three generations the film is forced to lean too heavily (out of necessity) on the crutch of constant voice-over narration, presumably quoted straight out of the book. It looks and sounds at times too much like a well-produced television drama (full screen VHS and DVD versions were 'formatted to fit your TV screen', to no real noticeable effect). In fact the film might have worked better had it actually been expanded into a mini-series. Each of the separate relationships deserves a full movie by itself, and cramming so many memorable biographies (by so many different narrators) into a single two-hour movie only dilutes the emotional impact of each story.

    This movie was one of the first successful Hollywood movies that featured mostly Asian American characters. However, years from now it will ultimately end up seen in a negative light. This movie perpetuates White Knight archetypes along the same veins as Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, and even Avatar, in which White males are positioned as the saviors for (backwards) foreigners. The author Amy Tan is a self-loathing, Uncle Tom writer. She never lived in Asia, exoticizes Chinese and Asian cultures, and improperly interprets Chinese terms and behaviors in all of her works. Her core reader demographic are White Americans who enjoy consuming self-righteous or superiority complex attitudes toward other cultures. Amy Tan, and other "White worshiping" Asian Americans like her (like Michelle Malkin), ultimately enjoy success and acceptance in America by pandering, or by demonizing Asian males. In terms of other identity or 2nd-generation American immigrant movies, one hardly sees Indian, Middle Eastern, South American, or other males portrayed in movies/books as negatively as Amy Tan portrays Asian males in all of her works. It also perpetuates damaging (and false) stereotypes regarding Asians and gender roles. When one looks at 2nd class status in Western religions, the lives of American women during the same time period, or the lower percentages of women in current political or corporate offices in America compared to China, the damaging stereotypes seem even more absurd.

    Against the backdrop of a raucous yet emotional "going away" party for a Chinese-American woman named June-Mei Woo (Ming-Na Wen), the wonderful and bittersweet stories of 8 women, 4 Chinese-born and 4 American born, are spun in splendor. June is preparing to depart from her home in San Francisco to China to meet 2 older sisters she has never seen before. The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother. Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin). But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being "Chinese". Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again. Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes. The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories. But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again. But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true. The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as "too corny" or "just another chick flick". Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

    The Joy Luck Club shows writers the commercial and critical success that is possible by using the structures and techniques of advanced screen writing. I have long argued that the old 3-act structure is too elementary for anyone wanting to write a mainstream Hollywood script that will actually sell. Trying to write an advanced film like The Joy Luck Club with it would be laughable. Here is a film that tells the story of eight women over the course of approximately sixty years. Does this film have three acts with plot twists on page 27 and page 87? Of course not. You could try to impose such a system - and I'm sure someone will - but what good would it do? The 3-act structure was never designed to help writers create a script. Its main use has been in demarcating a script after it's written. To see how this film is put together - and how you might write a film like it - we have to look at how the seven steps of every story interact with advanced structures. Every good story is founded on seven dramatic steps: problem/need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Sure enough, the first thing we notice when exploring the structure of The Joy Luck Club is that each of the eight stories works through the seven steps. Clearly some of the stories in the film fulfill the seven steps better than others. In general I found the mothers' stories more compelling than the daughters'. That may be due in part to the nature of history and geography. The mothers' stories take place in a brutally patriarchal China that is going through vast social and political upheaval. As a result, the mothers' stories have an epic canvas, and the problems these women face are more tragic and profound. The daughters, on the other hand, face the problems of the affluent American, of what has also been called the "end of history." Without the burden of war, famine, and slavery, these "modern" women are free to concentrate on the psychological, on the painful bond between parent and child, or in these cases, mother and daughter. Indeed, the biggest flaw of the film for me is that the psychological needs and self-revelations of the daughters are virtually identical. Each woman feels inadequate in the face of her mother's expectations of her. And each learns, through the help of her mother, that she is a valuable and unique individual. I don't mean to diminish the importance of this problem or revelation. On the contrary, I was overjoyed to see such a powerful feminine perspective coming from a film industry that is so excessively masculine. But the sameness of the daughters' problems makes these parts of the film drag. To see the power of this film, we must go beyond a simple seven step breakdown of each of the eight stories. The trick to this film is the way these stories are tied together. And for this, we need to look at advanced structures. Unlike the linear seven or twenty-two step structure used by almost all Hollywood films to track a single main character, advanced films require specialized structures that can tie a number of characters and stories together into an organic whole. This is a complex subject; there are over 15 different advanced structures (see the Advanced Screen writing Class), and each serves a different thematic purpose. The Joy Luck Club uses a variation of the branching structure. In branching structures, the author sets up a main trunk, then takes the story out to a series of branches that can be organized in an infinite number of ways. The problem with branching structures is: how do you sequence the branches to avoid repetition and the sense that the story is stopping and starting all the time. The Joy Luck Club strategy is to center the story within a communal event where we can meet all the characters and return after each story to get anchored. The main trunk of the story is provided by the desire line of June. She wants to visit her long-lost sisters in China. This single line creates the reason for the communal event, returns again and again throughout the story, and gives the story the ending that not only completes June's story but thematically completes the stories of the other seven characters as well.
