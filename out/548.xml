    Fans of The NeverEnding Story are likely to be disappointed by this third installment which differs completely from it's predecessors in turns of characterization and tone. Whilst the first sequel may not have lived up to some expectations, it did at least contain that same sense of wonder and fantastical charm that enriched the original. This third entry abandons our awe in favor of gags and goofs. Bastian this time around is played by Jason James Richter of 'Free Willy' fame. His father has remarried and he has subsequently acquired a teenage step-sister. It's not long before Bastian and his extended family are caught up in Fantasia, his land of imagination. Particularly when a group of comical high school bullies, led by Jack Back, steal The NeverEnding Story book and create havoc in both Fantasia and our world. The creature design this time is by the Jim Henson workshop. Sadly, their renditions of the inhabitants of Fantasia and indeed their personalities are inconsistent with the previous entries. For example, Falkor is reduced from being a noble and brave luck-dragon to a whiny and cowardly puppy dog. And this is what hurts the film the most. To the younger viewer it will be a mildly amusing affair, but to those who have followed the film series, it will appear to be a complete deviation that will have you aching for the Fantasia of old. The actors all turn in good performances but you feel they would all be best served by a more earnest script that employed plot lines from the Michael Ende's novel. Still, it's far superior to the live action television series that would later follow.

    For a film that bleats on about the importance of imagination, this third instalment in the tacky fantasy series has precious little of its own. This vomit-inducing series was unbearable back in the mid-'80s so God knows why anyone thought it would survive the '90s. This time Bastian (Jason James Richter, the third actor to play the part in as many films) gets plunged into another cheesy adventure when the Neverending Story book is stolen by school bullies, who start causing havoc in the soppy land of Fantasia. After a brief visit to the world of 'Wizard of Oz' rip-offs, Richter is transported back to Earth along with a hairy flying dragon, two gnomes, a talking tree who never shuts up and a baby made of rocks. This pudding-headed duffer is a load of old rubbish, not helped along by lazy plotting, Peter Macdonald's heavy-handed direction or the lacklustre acting. Only Jack Black, as a bully, and Melody Kay, as Richter's step-sister (yep, it's a boring dysfunctional family subplot) enliven proceedings. About as magical as a kick in the balls, frankly.

    This movie was so horribly done I was waiting for the moment for it to be over with. It was pretty torturous, from the bad acting, lame jokes trying to be "hip" to flat out disappointment in character development. This movie is just an embarrassment. I don't even associate this nor the NES II with the NES I(which was the only good one). The series could have been great if it was consistent in actors & quality. I think I'm going to go cry about the hour I wasted watching this movie. This site asks for my review to be at lest 10 lines.... How much can you write about a movie that sucked so bad you were on the edge of your seat waiting for it to be over? I literally just watched it so this review is fresh...and yes it was my first instinct to write a review for this movie so no on else has to suffer.

    I'm just trying to understand why this movie was made with so little effort. The plot could have worked but these filmmakers totally trashed the lovable concept of the magical Neverending story. The magic that captured me in the first two movies is non existent in this one. I cherished The Neverending Story 1 and 2 when I was a child, and I remember these stories being much more tragic and more magical. In this movie they made the characters a whole lot more silly than they had to be, and they have totally changed the looks of the characters. For instance the stone people were ridiculous and reminded me about Henson's TV-series 'Dinosaurs'. Falcor's looks have totally changed, I'm wondering if they did burn the Falcor puppet from the other movies? The only thing I loved about this movie, was Jack Black's performance. If it wasn't for him I would rate this movie with 0%.

    The first movie wasn't too bad, the second movie was not as good, this one is just plain awful. Let's start out with the villains. They have a level of retardedness as in a lot of children's' movies where they crash into each other a lot and can't keep control of their limbs on every corner as if they're running on ice. Many of the characters that were in the original have had their looks and personalities changed, even some have had their names changed, and there's many inconsistencies. Where's Atreyu? And Bastions' family has for some reason changed from having a dead mother to a dead father. Even the cover for The Neverending Story book has changed and is much thinner than it used to be. The puppetry looks ridiculous and the costume design has the same cheese factor as the early episodes of The Power Rangers. Falcor is no longer the wise luck dragon we remember but is now a clueless abomination that looks stoned. Rock Biter has somehow shrunk from being the size of a 3-story house to the size of a door. I couldn't watch this movie all the way through. It was poorly scripted, poorly acted, the costumes were poorly designed, and the whole movie in general was just plain stupid and dumb and totally destroyed the magic. I'm not surprised that Warner Bros. decided against distributing this, after watching it themselves they probably wanted to gouge their eyes out and have themselves hit on the head with a baseball bat to give them amnesia to forget what they saw and never have to see ever again.

I know what you're thinking: how bad can this movie be? I'll tell you how bad this movie is! This movie is so bad that it makes convicts in a prison look like boy scouts! If Bastian's trying to get to Fantasia(Not to be confused with the 1941 Disney movie), why don't you rename the movie "Neverending Story III: Escape TO Fantasia"?! Are you that dumb?! And why are the villains in the movie a bunch of middle-aged bullies simply named the Nasties? The nasties?!! Did the people who created this movie fell asleep while coming up with the name of the villains?! And here's the worst scene yet: The Rockbiter and his family. What the heck?! There's TV in Fantasia?! How'd ya get TV in Fantasia?! And who knew that the Rockbiter has to sing a song?! What is this anyway, Rockbiter: The Musical?! Why do I even bother watching this movie?! Why, why, why, WHY, WHY?!!!!

    OK, a few years ago I found at Target a package with all three Neverending Story films, also really cheap, so I picked them up. The first film is one of my childhood favorites and still holds up to this day. I'm not alone in this either, I didn't realize what kind of a following the film had and that others watched it as children too. I watched the second one when I got the package and thought it was alright, I also thought the title was pretty funny. Wouldn't it be hilarious if some person got a lawyer for "false advertising" because of the title of the Neverending Story? Anyways, the second one is just an alright film, a little below average but not terrible. Now, something about the third on gave me chills when I grabbed it, I think I should have listened to my instincts. I don't even know where to start with the badness. Now everything that was charming about the first film, throw it out! Everything that was trying to continue the story in the second film, throw it out! This is what was puked up from the two films and it's terrifying. Bastian Balthazar has begun a new chapter in his life. His father has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother, Jane, whose daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. He manages to get them expelled by the janitor after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia, where he is reunited with old friends. However, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm and now plan to steal the amulet to grant their own nasty wishes. See, normally I like bad films, however this was just bad. For God's sake, Valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully and made you feel special, this Valcor looks like a thrown out in the dumpster Chuck-E-Cheese costume. Not to mention the voice is completely different and sounds like some kind of ridicules Gilligan mook. Then the rock monster, who in the first film was the saddest figure, a giant who lost his friends to the Nothing and felt sorrow and spoke so beautiful now has a family, his wife talks like Arnold Schwartzenegger, he's now 1/5 his size and his kid wants to go on a motorcycle ride with him while he sings "Born to be Wild". The villain is no longer an entity; it's a group of bullies called The Nasties being led by Jack Black (LOL). There is nothing redeeming about this film. The acting is terrible and the only decent enough performance is Jack Black who you can understand why he was successful because as much of a bad story as this is, he looked like he was having fun. The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short, the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice, stick to the first film, it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either, it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie: We must not give into the Nasty! 1/10

    Okay, this film is really just for kids with the creatures, the fantasy, and ridiculous storyline about a magical storybook. Anyway, Jack Black is a surprise here in one his earliest films where he plays the leader of the nasties. He and his gang of tattooed high school failures are called the nasties and terrorize the kids in school. This time, they terrorized poor Bastian who is new and has a new family including a stepsister whose not so keen on the new family addition of stepfather and brother in her mother's household. Anyway, the film plot is boring. It never really develops nor do we care too. There is too much in the fantasy world of Fantasia where Bastian goes to escape the Nasties and returns with a couple of them to Earth. When the Nasties get a hold of the special magical book, they are tempted to make changes and alter two worlds. A silly film for kids only. Maybe they'll get it.

    How I wish this movie never existed. So how many things are wrong with nes III? OK, every single problem with this trash's waste makes up one person. We would have the population of China, SQUARED. No, CUBED!!! Why is it bad? Here are a couple reasons why. 1. They turned Falcor into a complete retard. Falcor was supposed to be mystical and wise. In this one however, he is the equivalent of Patrick Star. 2. The rockbiter (or the rockchewer in this crapfest) is nowhere near the same one I know and love from the first movie. He rides on a motorcycle SINGING. In case you're wondering, I'm not joking. Watch it for yourself. 3. The villains are unimaginative. In NES I, the villain was an abstract entity. In II, the villain was in human form. In this one, they're just school bullies. I'm dead serious. Don't believe me? See this movie and watch it for yourself. 4. Inconsistencies. Count the stars. Then square that. That's how many of those you'll find in this movie. 5. Bastian is useless in this movie. He does absolutely nothing to try and help the situation he is in. He doesn't take advantage of the wishes he could be making. Even the NASTIES are more heroes in this movie because they take advantage of what they have. That's why I want The NeverEnding Story III to never exist. This crap gets a doesn't deserve to be on IMDb, the dictionary, brains, the earth, the galaxy, the universe, and if we have one, GOD. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT EXIST!!!

    this is pure crap! I swear the creator of the movie was drunk when he made this! I'm convinced! I saw the first movie,it was beautiful,the second one was not great,but it's A lot better than this,at least the second movie had better puppets and settings.The third movie just had no effort. The only thing I liked in this movie was Jack Black and thats it. But there are many things I hate about this! First of all,the characters are annoying as hell,Bastian,His step-sister,Falcor,the rockbaby,there are just too many characters to count. And Atreyu is not in it,but if he was, I bet they would just make him look like Macauly Culkin and turn him into a pussy But my BIGGEST problem with this movie is Falcor and The Rock Biter They turned them into idiots! Falcor was wise and brave in the first movie,but in this movie,he's now Patrick the starfish.and the puppet for Falcor,don't even get me started! Same goes for the Rock Biter! The Rock Biter now has a family! He's living in a sitcom now!and his family,they just sound so...so,well,the wife sounds like a man and the baby,oh god the baby..... But, when the rockbiter started singing Born to Be Wild,That's when i pulled out chunks of my hair! Just watch Neverending story 1 and 3 together and look at the difference This movie isn't even a 1,it's a -100,it's the worst sequel in cinema history!

Only Jack Black, as a bully, and Melody Kay, as Richter's step-sister (yep, it's a boring dysfunctional family subplot) enliven proceedings. About as magical as a kick in the balls, frankly.

The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short, the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice, stick to the first film, it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either, it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie: We must not give into the Nasty! 1/10

    Okay, this film is really just for kids with the creatures, the fantasy, and ridiculous storyline about a magical storybook. Anyway, Jack Black is a surprise here in one his earliest films where he plays the leader of the nasties. He and his gang of tattooed high school failures are called the nasties and terrorize the kids in school. This time, they terrorized poor Bastian who is new and has a new family including a stepsister whose not so keen on the new family addition of stepfather and brother in her mother's household. Anyway, the film plot is boring. It never really develops nor do we care too. There is too much in the fantasy world of Fantasia where Bastian goes to escape the Nasties and returns with a couple of them to Earth. When the Nasties get a hold of the special magical book, they are tempted to make changes and alter two worlds. A silly film for kids only. Maybe they'll get it.

    How I wish this movie never existed. So how many things are wrong with nes III? OK, every single problem with this trash's waste makes up one person. We would have the population of China, SQUARED. No, CUBED!!! Why is it bad? Here are a couple reasons why. 1. They turned Falcor into a complete retard. Falcor was supposed to be mystical and wise. In this one however, he is the equivalent of Patrick Star. 2. The rockbiter (or the rockchewer in this crapfest) is nowhere near the same one I know and love from the first movie. He rides on a motorcycle SINGING. In case you're wondering, I'm not joking. Watch it for yourself. 3. The villains are unimaginative. In NES I, the villain was an abstract entity. In II, the villain was in human form. In this one, they're just school bullies. I'm dead serious. Don't believe me? See this movie and watch it for yourself. 4. Inconsistencies. Count the stars. Then square that. That's how many of those you'll find in this movie. 5. Bastian is useless in this movie. He does absolutely nothing to try and help the situation he is in. He doesn't take advantage of the wishes he could be making. Even the NASTIES are more heroes in this movie because they take advantage of what they have. That's why I want The NeverEnding Story III to never exist. This crap gets a doesn't deserve to be on IMDb, the dictionary, brains, the earth, the galaxy, the universe, and if we have one, GOD. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT EXIST!!!

    this is pure crap! I swear the creator of the movie was drunk when he made this! I'm convinced! I saw the first movie,it was beautiful,the second one was not great,but it's A lot better than this,at least the second movie had better puppets and settings.The third movie just had no effort. The only thing I liked in this movie was Jack Black and thats it. But there are many things I hate about this! First of all,the characters are annoying as hell,Bastian,His step-sister,Falcor,the rockbaby,there are just too many characters to count. And Atreyu is not in it,but if he was, I bet they would just make him look like Macauly Culkin and turn him into a pussy But my BIGGEST problem with this movie is Falcor and The Rock Biter They turned them into idiots! Falcor was wise and brave in the first movie,but in this movie,he's now Patrick the starfish.and the puppet for Falcor,don't even get me started! Same goes for the Rock Biter! The Rock Biter now has a family! He's living in a sitcom now!and his family,they just sound so...so,well,the wife sounds like a man and the baby,oh god the baby..... But, when the rockbiter started singing Born to Be Wild,That's when i pulled out chunks of my hair! Just watch Neverending story 1 and 3 together and look at the difference This movie isn't even a 1,it's a -100,it's the worst sequel in cinema history!

    Fans of The NeverEnding Story are likely to be disappointed by this third installment which differs completely from it's predecessors in turns of characterization and tone. Whilst the first sequel may not have lived up to some expectations, it did at least contain that same sense of wonder and fantastical charm that enriched the original. This third entry abandons our awe in favor of gags and goofs. Bastian this time around is played by Jason James Richter of 'Free Willy' fame. His father has remarried and he has subsequently acquired a teenage step-sister. It's not long before Bastian and his extended family are caught up in Fantasia, his land of imagination. Particularly when a group of comical high school bullies, led by Jack Back, steal The NeverEnding Story book and create havoc in both Fantasia and our world. The creature design this time is by the Jim Henson workshop. Sadly, their renditions of the inhabitants of Fantasia and indeed their personalities are inconsistent with the previous entries. For example, Falkor is reduced from being a noble and brave luck-dragon to a whiny and cowardly puppy dog. And this is what hurts the film the most. To the younger viewer it will be a mildly amusing affair, but to those who have followed the film series, it will appear to be a complete deviation that will have you aching for the Fantasia of old. The actors all turn in good performances but you feel they would all be best served by a more earnest script that employed plot lines from the Michael Ende's novel. Still, it's far superior to the live action television series that would later follow.

    For a film that bleats on about the importance of imagination, this third instalment in the tacky fantasy series has precious little of its own. This vomit-inducing series was unbearable back in the mid-'80s so God knows why anyone thought it would survive the '90s. This time Bastian (Jason James Richter, the third actor to play the part in as many films) gets plunged into another cheesy adventure when the Neverending Story book is stolen by school bullies, who start causing havoc in the soppy land of Fantasia. After a brief visit to the world of 'Wizard of Oz' rip-offs, Richter is transported back to Earth along with a hairy flying dragon, two gnomes, a talking tree who never shuts up and a baby made of rocks. This pudding-headed duffer is a load of old rubbish, not helped along by lazy plotting, Peter Macdonald's heavy-handed direction or the lacklustre acting. Only Jack Black, as a bully, and Melody Kay, as Richter's step-sister (yep, it's a boring dysfunctional family subplot) enliven proceedings. About as magical as a kick in the balls, frankly.

    This movie was so horribly done I was waiting for the moment for it to be over with. It was pretty torturous, from the bad acting, lame jokes trying to be "hip" to flat out disappointment in character development. This movie is just an embarrassment. I don't even associate this nor the NES II with the NES I(which was the only good one). The series could have been great if it was consistent in actors & quality. I think I'm going to go cry about the hour I wasted watching this movie. This site asks for my review to be at lest 10 lines.... How much can you write about a movie that sucked so bad you were on the edge of your seat waiting for it to be over? I literally just watched it so this review is fresh...and yes it was my first instinct to write a review for this movie so no on else has to suffer.

    I'm just trying to understand why this movie was made with so little effort. The plot could have worked but these filmmakers totally trashed the lovable concept of the magical Neverending story. The magic that captured me in the first two movies is non existent in this one. I cherished The Neverending Story 1 and 2 when I was a child, and I remember these stories being much more tragic and more magical. In this movie they made the characters a whole lot more silly than they had to be, and they have totally changed the looks of the characters. For instance the stone people were ridiculous and reminded me about Henson's TV-series 'Dinosaurs'. Falcor's looks have totally changed, I'm wondering if they did burn the Falcor puppet from the other movies? The only thing I loved about this movie, was Jack Black's performance. If it wasn't for him I would rate this movie with 0%.

    The first movie wasn't too bad, the second movie was not as good, this one is just plain awful. Let's start out with the villains. They have a level of retardedness as in a lot of children's' movies where they crash into each other a lot and can't keep control of their limbs on every corner as if they're running on ice. Many of the characters that were in the original have had their looks and personalities changed, even some have had their names changed, and there's many inconsistencies. Where's Atreyu? And Bastions' family has for some reason changed from having a dead mother to a dead father. Even the cover for The Neverending Story book has changed and is much thinner than it used to be. The puppetry looks ridiculous and the costume design has the same cheese factor as the early episodes of The Power Rangers. Falcor is no longer the wise luck dragon we remember but is now a clueless abomination that looks stoned. Rock Biter has somehow shrunk from being the size of a 3-story house to the size of a door. I couldn't watch this movie all the way through. It was poorly scripted, poorly acted, the costumes were poorly designed, and the whole movie in general was just plain stupid and dumb and totally destroyed the magic. I'm not surprised that Warner Bros. decided against distributing this, after watching it themselves they probably wanted to gouge their eyes out and have themselves hit on the head with a baseball bat to give them amnesia to forget what they saw and never have to see ever again.

I know what you're thinking: how bad can this movie be? I'll tell you how bad this movie is! This movie is so bad that it makes convicts in a prison look like boy scouts! If Bastian's trying to get to Fantasia(Not to be confused with the 1941 Disney movie), why don't you rename the movie "Neverending Story III: Escape TO Fantasia"?! Are you that dumb?! And why are the villains in the movie a bunch of middle-aged bullies simply named the Nasties? The nasties?!! Did the people who created this movie fell asleep while coming up with the name of the villains?! And here's the worst scene yet: The Rockbiter and his family. What the heck?! There's TV in Fantasia?! How'd ya get TV in Fantasia?! And who knew that the Rockbiter has to sing a song?! What is this anyway, Rockbiter: The Musical?! Why do I even bother watching this movie?! Why, why, why, WHY, WHY?!!!!

    OK, a few years ago I found at Target a package with all three Neverending Story films, also really cheap, so I picked them up. The first film is one of my childhood favorites and still holds up to this day. I'm not alone in this either, I didn't realize what kind of a following the film had and that others watched it as children too. I watched the second one when I got the package and thought it was alright, I also thought the title was pretty funny. Wouldn't it be hilarious if some person got a lawyer for "false advertising" because of the title of the Neverending Story? Anyways, the second one is just an alright film, a little below average but not terrible. Now, something about the third on gave me chills when I grabbed it, I think I should have listened to my instincts. I don't even know where to start with the badness. Now everything that was charming about the first film, throw it out! Everything that was trying to continue the story in the second film, throw it out! This is what was puked up from the two films and it's terrifying. Bastian Balthazar has begun a new chapter in his life. His father has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother, Jane, whose daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. He manages to get them expelled by the janitor after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia, where he is reunited with old friends. However, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm and now plan to steal the amulet to grant their own nasty wishes. See, normally I like bad films, however this was just bad. For God's sake, Valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully and made you feel special, this Valcor looks like a thrown out in the dumpster Chuck-E-Cheese costume. Not to mention the voice is completely different and sounds like some kind of ridicules Gilligan mook. Then the rock monster, who in the first film was the saddest figure, a giant who lost his friends to the Nothing and felt sorrow and spoke so beautiful now has a family, his wife talks like Arnold Schwartzenegger, he's now 1/5 his size and his kid wants to go on a motorcycle ride with him while he sings "Born to be Wild". The villain is no longer an entity; it's a group of bullies called The Nasties being led by Jack Black (LOL). There is nothing redeeming about this film. The acting is terrible and the only decent enough performance is Jack Black who you can understand why he was successful because as much of a bad story as this is, he looked like he was having fun. The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short, the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice, stick to the first film, it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either, it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie: We must not give into the Nasty! 1/10

There's TV in Fantasia?! How'd ya get TV in Fantasia?! And who knew that the Rockbiter has to sing a song?! What is this anyway, Rockbiter: The Musical?! Why do I even bother watching this movie?! Why, why, why, WHY, WHY?!!!!

    OK, a few years ago I found at Target a package with all three Neverending Story films, also really cheap, so I picked them up. The first film is one of my childhood favorites and still holds up to this day. I'm not alone in this either, I didn't realize what kind of a following the film had and that others watched it as children too. I watched the second one when I got the package and thought it was alright, I also thought the title was pretty funny. Wouldn't it be hilarious if some person got a lawyer for "false advertising" because of the title of the Neverending Story? Anyways, the second one is just an alright film, a little below average but not terrible. Now, something about the third on gave me chills when I grabbed it, I think I should have listened to my instincts. I don't even know where to start with the badness. Now everything that was charming about the first film, throw it out! Everything that was trying to continue the story in the second film, throw it out! This is what was puked up from the two films and it's terrifying. Bastian Balthazar has begun a new chapter in his life. His father has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother, Jane, whose daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. He manages to get them expelled by the janitor after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia, where he is reunited with old friends. However, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm and now plan to steal the amulet to grant their own nasty wishes. See, normally I like bad films, however this was just bad. For God's sake, Valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully and made you feel special, this Valcor looks like a thrown out in the dumpster Chuck-E-Cheese costume. Not to mention the voice is completely different and sounds like some kind of ridicules Gilligan mook. Then the rock monster, who in the first film was the saddest figure, a giant who lost his friends to the Nothing and felt sorrow and spoke so beautiful now has a family, his wife talks like Arnold Schwartzenegger, he's now 1/5 his size and his kid wants to go on a motorcycle ride with him while he sings "Born to be Wild". The villain is no longer an entity; it's a group of bullies called The Nasties being led by Jack Black (LOL). There is nothing redeeming about this film. The acting is terrible and the only decent enough performance is Jack Black who you can understand why he was successful because as much of a bad story as this is, he looked like he was having fun. The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short, the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice, stick to the first film, it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either, it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie: We must not give into the Nasty! 1/10

    Okay, this film is really just for kids with the creatures, the fantasy, and ridiculous storyline about a magical storybook. Anyway, Jack Black is a surprise here in one his earliest films where he plays the leader of the nasties. He and his gang of tattooed high school failures are called the nasties and terrorize the kids in school. This time, they terrorized poor Bastian who is new and has a new family including a stepsister whose not so keen on the new family addition of stepfather and brother in her mother's household. Anyway, the film plot is boring. It never really develops nor do we care too. There is too much in the fantasy world of Fantasia where Bastian goes to escape the Nasties and returns with a couple of them to Earth. When the Nasties get a hold of the special magical book, they are tempted to make changes and alter two worlds. A silly film for kids only. Maybe they'll get it.

    How I wish this movie never existed. So how many things are wrong with nes III? OK, every single problem with this trash's waste makes up one person. We would have the population of China, SQUARED. No, CUBED!!! Why is it bad? Here are a couple reasons why. 1. They turned Falcor into a complete retard. Falcor was supposed to be mystical and wise. In this one however, he is the equivalent of Patrick Star. 2. The rockbiter (or the rockchewer in this crapfest) is nowhere near the same one I know and love from the first movie. He rides on a motorcycle SINGING. In case you're wondering, I'm not joking. Watch it for yourself. 3. The villains are unimaginative. In NES I, the villain was an abstract entity. In II, the villain was in human form. In this one, they're just school bullies. I'm dead serious. Don't believe me? See this movie and watch it for yourself. 4. Inconsistencies. Count the stars. Then square that. That's how many of those you'll find in this movie. 5. Bastian is useless in this movie. He does absolutely nothing to try and help the situation he is in. He doesn't take advantage of the wishes he could be making. Even the NASTIES are more heroes in this movie because they take advantage of what they have. That's why I want The NeverEnding Story III to never exist. This crap gets a doesn't deserve to be on IMDb, the dictionary, brains, the earth, the galaxy, the universe, and if we have one, GOD. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT EXIST!!!

    this is pure crap! I swear the creator of the movie was drunk when he made this! I'm convinced! I saw the first movie,it was beautiful,the second one was not great,but it's A lot better than this,at least the second movie had better puppets and settings.The third movie just had no effort. The only thing I liked in this movie was Jack Black and thats it. But there are many things I hate about this! First of all,the characters are annoying as hell,Bastian,His step-sister,Falcor,the rockbaby,there are just too many characters to count. And Atreyu is not in it,but if he was, I bet they would just make him look like Macauly Culkin and turn him into a pussy But my BIGGEST problem with this movie is Falcor and The Rock Biter They turned them into idiots! Falcor was wise and brave in the first movie,but in this movie,he's now Patrick the starfish.and the puppet for Falcor,don't even get me started! Same goes for the Rock Biter! The Rock Biter now has a family! He's living in a sitcom now!and his family,they just sound so...so,well,the wife sounds like a man and the baby,oh god the baby..... But, when the rockbiter started singing Born to Be Wild,That's when i pulled out chunks of my hair! Just watch Neverending story 1 and 3 together and look at the difference This movie isn't even a 1,it's a -100,it's the worst sequel in cinema history!

    Fans of The NeverEnding Story are likely to be disappointed by this third installment which differs completely from it's predecessors in turns of characterization and tone. Whilst the first sequel may not have lived up to some expectations, it did at least contain that same sense of wonder and fantastical charm that enriched the original. This third entry abandons our awe in favor of gags and goofs. Bastian this time around is played by Jason James Richter of 'Free Willy' fame. His father has remarried and he has subsequently acquired a teenage step-sister. It's not long before Bastian and his extended family are caught up in Fantasia, his land of imagination. Particularly when a group of comical high school bullies, led by Jack Back, steal The NeverEnding Story book and create havoc in both Fantasia and our world. The creature design this time is by the Jim Henson workshop. Sadly, their renditions of the inhabitants of Fantasia and indeed their personalities are inconsistent with the previous entries. For example, Falkor is reduced from being a noble and brave luck-dragon to a whiny and cowardly puppy dog. And this is what hurts the film the most. To the younger viewer it will be a mildly amusing affair, but to those who have followed the film series, it will appear to be a complete deviation that will have you aching for the Fantasia of old. The actors all turn in good performances but you feel they would all be best served by a more earnest script that employed plot lines from the Michael Ende's novel. Still, it's far superior to the live action television series that would later follow.

    For a film that bleats on about the importance of imagination, this third instalment in the tacky fantasy series has precious little of its own. This vomit-inducing series was unbearable back in the mid-'80s so God knows why anyone thought it would survive the '90s. This time Bastian (Jason James Richter, the third actor to play the part in as many films) gets plunged into another cheesy adventure when the Neverending Story book is stolen by school bullies, who start causing havoc in the soppy land of Fantasia. After a brief visit to the world of 'Wizard of Oz' rip-offs, Richter is transported back to Earth along with a hairy flying dragon, two gnomes, a talking tree who never shuts up and a baby made of rocks. This pudding-headed duffer is a load of old rubbish, not helped along by lazy plotting, Peter Macdonald's heavy-handed direction or the lacklustre acting. Only Jack Black, as a bully, and Melody Kay, as Richter's step-sister (yep, it's a boring dysfunctional family subplot) enliven proceedings. About as magical as a kick in the balls, frankly.

    This movie was so horribly done I was waiting for the moment for it to be over with. It was pretty torturous, from the bad acting, lame jokes trying to be "hip" to flat out disappointment in character development. This movie is just an embarrassment. I don't even associate this nor the NES II with the NES I(which was the only good one). The series could have been great if it was consistent in actors & quality. I think I'm going to go cry about the hour I wasted watching this movie. This site asks for my review to be at lest 10 lines.... How much can you write about a movie that sucked so bad you were on the edge of your seat waiting for it to be over? I literally just watched it so this review is fresh...and yes it was my first instinct to write a review for this movie so no on else has to suffer.

    I'm just trying to understand why this movie was made with so little effort. The plot could have worked but these filmmakers totally trashed the lovable concept of the magical Neverending story. The magic that captured me in the first two movies is non existent in this one. I cherished The Neverending Story 1 and 2 when I was a child, and I remember these stories being much more tragic and more magical. In this movie they made the characters a whole lot more silly than they had to be, and they have totally changed the looks of the characters. For instance the stone people were ridiculous and reminded me about Henson's TV-series 'Dinosaurs'. Falcor's looks have totally changed, I'm wondering if they did burn the Falcor puppet from the other movies? The only thing I loved about this movie, was Jack Black's performance. If it wasn't for him I would rate this movie with 0%.

    The first movie wasn't too bad, the second movie was not as good, this one is just plain awful. Let's start out with the villains. They have a level of retardedness as in a lot of children's' movies where they crash into each other a lot and can't keep control of their limbs on every corner as if they're running on ice. Many of the characters that were in the original have had their looks and personalities changed, even some have had their names changed, and there's many inconsistencies. Where's Atreyu? And Bastions' family has for some reason changed from having a dead mother to a dead father. Even the cover for The Neverending Story book has changed and is much thinner than it used to be. The puppetry looks ridiculous and the costume design has the same cheese factor as the early episodes of The Power Rangers. Falcor is no longer the wise luck dragon we remember but is now a clueless abomination that looks stoned. Rock Biter has somehow shrunk from being the size of a 3-story house to the size of a door. I couldn't watch this movie all the way through. It was poorly scripted, poorly acted, the costumes were poorly designed, and the whole movie in general was just plain stupid and dumb and totally destroyed the magic. I'm not surprised that Warner Bros. decided against distributing this, after watching it themselves they probably wanted to gouge their eyes out and have themselves hit on the head with a baseball bat to give them amnesia to forget what they saw and never have to see ever again.

    When I watched a trailer for this movie, I noticed how ironic it is with this quote: "Neverending Fun". Yep, you read that right: "Neverending Fun". More like never ending stupidity! I know what you're thinking: how bad can this movie be? I'll tell you how bad this movie is! This movie is so bad that it makes convicts in a prison look like boy scouts! If Bastian's trying to get to Fantasia(Not to be confused with the 1941 Disney movie), why don't you rename the movie "Neverending Story III: Escape TO Fantasia"?! Are you that dumb?! And why are the villains in the movie a bunch of middle-aged bullies simply named the Nasties? The nasties?!! Did the people who created this movie fell asleep while coming up with the name of the villains?! And here's the worst scene yet: The Rockbiter and his family. What the heck?! There's TV in Fantasia?! How'd ya get TV in Fantasia?! And who knew that the Rockbiter has to sing a song?! What is this anyway, Rockbiter: The Musical?! Why do I even bother watching this movie?!

Falcor's looks have totally changed, I'm wondering if they did burn the Falcor puppet from the other movies? The only thing I loved about this movie, was Jack Black's performance. If it wasn't for him I would rate this movie with 0%.

    The first movie wasn't too bad, the second movie was not as good, this one is just plain awful. Let's start out with the villains. They have a level of retardedness as in a lot of children's' movies where they crash into each other a lot and can't keep control of their limbs on every corner as if they're running on ice. Many of the characters that were in the original have had their looks and personalities changed, even some have had their names changed, and there's many inconsistencies. Where's Atreyu? And Bastions' family has for some reason changed from having a dead mother to a dead father. Even the cover for The Neverending Story book has changed and is much thinner than it used to be. The puppetry looks ridiculous and the costume design has the same cheese factor as the early episodes of The Power Rangers. Falcor is no longer the wise luck dragon we remember but is now a clueless abomination that looks stoned. Rock Biter has somehow shrunk from being the size of a 3-story house to the size of a door. I couldn't watch this movie all the way through. It was poorly scripted, poorly acted, the costumes were poorly designed, and the whole movie in general was just plain stupid and dumb and totally destroyed the magic. I'm not surprised that Warner Bros. decided against distributing this, after watching it themselves they probably wanted to gouge their eyes out and have themselves hit on the head with a baseball bat to give them amnesia to forget what they saw and never have to see ever again.

    When I watched a trailer for this movie, I noticed how ironic it is with this quote: "Neverending Fun". Yep, you read that right: "Neverending Fun". More like never ending stupidity! I know what you're thinking: how bad can this movie be? I'll tell you how bad this movie is! This movie is so bad that it makes convicts in a prison look like boy scouts! If Bastian's trying to get to Fantasia(Not to be confused with the 1941 Disney movie), why don't you rename the movie "Neverending Story III: Escape TO Fantasia"?! Are you that dumb?! And why are the villains in the movie a bunch of middle-aged bullies simply named the Nasties? The nasties?!! Did the people who created this movie fell asleep while coming up with the name of the villains?! And here's the worst scene yet: The Rockbiter and his family. What the heck?! There's TV in Fantasia?! How'd ya get TV in Fantasia?! And who knew that the Rockbiter has to sing a song?! What is this anyway, Rockbiter: The Musical?! Why do I even bother watching this movie?! Why, why, why, WHY, WHY?!!!!

    OK, a few years ago I found at Target a package with all three Neverending Story films, also really cheap, so I picked them up. The first film is one of my childhood favorites and still holds up to this day. I'm not alone in this either, I didn't realize what kind of a following the film had and that others watched it as children too. I watched the second one when I got the package and thought it was alright, I also thought the title was pretty funny. Wouldn't it be hilarious if some person got a lawyer for "false advertising" because of the title of the Neverending Story? Anyways, the second one is just an alright film, a little below average but not terrible. Now, something about the third on gave me chills when I grabbed it, I think I should have listened to my instincts. I don't even know where to start with the badness. Now everything that was charming about the first film, throw it out! Everything that was trying to continue the story in the second film, throw it out! This is what was puked up from the two films and it's terrifying. Bastian Balthazar has begun a new chapter in his life. His father has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother, Jane, whose daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. He manages to get them expelled by the janitor after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia, where he is reunited with old friends. However, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm and now plan to steal the amulet to grant their own nasty wishes. See, normally I like bad films, however this was just bad. For God's sake, Valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully and made you feel special, this Valcor looks like a thrown out in the dumpster Chuck-E-Cheese costume. Not to mention the voice is completely different and sounds like some kind of ridicules Gilligan mook. Then the rock monster, who in the first film was the saddest figure, a giant who lost his friends to the Nothing and felt sorrow and spoke so beautiful now has a family, his wife talks like Arnold Schwartzenegger, he's now 1/5 his size and his kid wants to go on a motorcycle ride with him while he sings "Born to be Wild". The villain is no longer an entity; it's a group of bullies called The Nasties being led by Jack Black (LOL). There is nothing redeeming about this film. The acting is terrible and the only decent enough performance is Jack Black who you can understand why he was successful because as much of a bad story as this is, he looked like he was having fun. The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short, the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice, stick to the first film, it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either, it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie: We must not give into the Nasty! 1/10

    Okay, this film is really just for kids with the creatures, the fantasy, and ridiculous storyline about a magical storybook. Anyway, Jack Black is a surprise here in one his earliest films where he plays the leader of the nasties. He and his gang of tattooed high school failures are called the nasties and terrorize the kids in school. This time, they terrorized poor Bastian who is new and has a new family including a stepsister whose not so keen on the new family addition of stepfather and brother in her mother's household. Anyway, the film plot is boring. It never really develops nor do we care too. There is too much in the fantasy world of Fantasia where Bastian goes to escape the Nasties and returns with a couple of them to Earth. When the Nasties get a hold of the special magical book, they are tempted to make changes and alter two worlds. A silly film for kids only. Maybe they'll get it.

    How I wish this movie never existed. So how many things are wrong with nes III? OK, every single problem with this trash's waste makes up one person. We would have the population of China, SQUARED. No, CUBED!!! Why is it bad? Here are a couple reasons why. 1. They turned Falcor into a complete retard. Falcor was supposed to be mystical and wise. In this one however, he is the equivalent of Patrick Star. 2. The rockbiter (or the rockchewer in this crapfest) is nowhere near the same one I know and love from the first movie. He rides on a motorcycle SINGING. In case you're wondering, I'm not joking. Watch it for yourself. 3. The villains are unimaginative. In NES I, the villain was an abstract entity. In II, the villain was in human form. In this one, they're just school bullies. I'm dead serious. Don't believe me? See this movie and watch it for yourself. 4. Inconsistencies. Count the stars. Then square that. That's how many of those you'll find in this movie. 5. Bastian is useless in this movie. He does absolutely nothing to try and help the situation he is in. He doesn't take advantage of the wishes he could be making. Even the NASTIES are more heroes in this movie because they take advantage of what they have. That's why I want The NeverEnding Story III to never exist. This crap gets a doesn't deserve to be on IMDb, the dictionary, brains, the earth, the galaxy, the universe, and if we have one, GOD. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT EXIST!!!

    this is pure crap! I swear the creator of the movie was drunk when he made this! I'm convinced! I saw the first movie,it was beautiful,the second one was not great,but it's A lot better than this,at least the second movie had better puppets and settings.The third movie just had no effort. The only thing I liked in this movie was Jack Black and thats it. But there are many things I hate about this! First of all,the characters are annoying as hell,Bastian,His step-sister,Falcor,the rockbaby,there are just too many characters to count. And Atreyu is not in it,but if he was, I bet they would just make him look like Macauly Culkin and turn him into a pussy But my BIGGEST problem with this movie is Falcor and The Rock Biter They turned them into idiots! Falcor was wise and brave in the first movie,but in this movie,he's now Patrick the starfish.and the puppet for Falcor,don't even get me started! Same goes for the Rock Biter! The Rock Biter now has a family! He's living in a sitcom now!and his family,they just sound so...so,well,the wife sounds like a man and the baby,oh god the baby..... But, when the rockbiter started singing Born to Be Wild,That's when i pulled out chunks of my hair! Just watch Neverending story 1 and 3 together and look at the difference This movie isn't even a 1,it's a -100,it's the worst sequel in cinema history!

    Fans of The NeverEnding Story are likely to be disappointed by this third installment which differs completely from it's predecessors in turns of characterization and tone. Whilst the first sequel may not have lived up to some expectations, it did at least contain that same sense of wonder and fantastical charm that enriched the original. This third entry abandons our awe in favor of gags and goofs. Bastian this time around is played by Jason James Richter of 'Free Willy' fame. His father has remarried and he has subsequently acquired a teenage step-sister. It's not long before Bastian and his extended family are caught up in Fantasia, his land of imagination. Particularly when a group of comical high school bullies, led by Jack Back, steal The NeverEnding Story book and create havoc in both Fantasia and our world. The creature design this time is by the Jim Henson workshop. Sadly, their renditions of the inhabitants of Fantasia and indeed their personalities are inconsistent with the previous entries. For example, Falkor is reduced from being a noble and brave luck-dragon to a whiny and cowardly puppy dog. And this is what hurts the film the most. To the younger viewer it will be a mildly amusing affair, but to those who have followed the film series, it will appear to be a complete deviation that will have you aching for the Fantasia of old. The actors all turn in good performances but you feel they would all be best served by a more earnest script that employed plot lines from the Michael Ende's novel. Still, it's far superior to the live action television series that would later follow.

    For a film that bleats on about the importance of imagination, this third instalment in the tacky fantasy series has precious little of its own. This vomit-inducing series was unbearable back in the mid-'80s so God knows why anyone thought it would survive the '90s. This time Bastian (Jason James Richter, the third actor to play the part in as many films) gets plunged into another cheesy adventure when the Neverending Story book is stolen by school bullies, who start causing havoc in the soppy land of Fantasia. After a brief visit to the world of 'Wizard of Oz' rip-offs, Richter is transported back to Earth along with a hairy flying dragon, two gnomes, a talking tree who never shuts up and a baby made of rocks. This pudding-headed duffer is a load of old rubbish, not helped along by lazy plotting, Peter Macdonald's heavy-handed direction or the lacklustre acting. Only Jack Black, as a bully, and Melody Kay, as Richter's step-sister (yep, it's a boring dysfunctional family subplot) enliven proceedings. About as magical as a kick in the balls, frankly.

    This movie was so horribly done I was waiting for the moment for it to be over with. It was pretty torturous, from the bad acting, lame jokes trying to be "hip" to flat out disappointment in character development. This movie is just an embarrassment. I don't even associate this nor the NES II with the NES I(which was the only good one). The series could have been great if it was consistent in actors & quality. I think I'm going to go cry about the hour I wasted watching this movie. This site asks for my review to be at lest 10 lines.... How much can you write about a movie that sucked so bad you were on the edge of your seat waiting for it to be over? I literally just watched it so this review is fresh...and yes it was my first instinct to write a review for this movie so no on else has to suffer.

    I'm just trying to understand why this movie was made with so little effort. The plot could have worked but these filmmakers totally trashed the lovable concept of the magical Neverending story. The magic that captured me in the first two movies is non existent in this one. I cherished The Neverending Story 1 and 2 when I was a child, and I remember these stories being much more tragic and more magical. In this movie they made the characters a whole lot more silly than they had to be, and they have totally changed the looks of the characters. For instance the stone people were ridiculous and reminded me about Henson's TV-series 'Dinosaurs'. Falcor's looks have totally changed, I'm wondering if they did burn the Falcor puppet from the other movies? The only thing I loved about this movie, was Jack Black's performance. If it wasn't for him I would rate this movie with 0%.

    For a film that bleats on about the importance of imagination, this third instalment in the tacky fantasy series has precious little of its own. This vomit-inducing series was unbearable back in the mid-'80s so God knows why anyone thought it would survive the '90s. This time Bastian (Jason James Richter, the third actor to play the part in as many films) gets plunged into another cheesy adventure when the Neverending Story book is stolen by school bullies, who start causing havoc in the soppy land of Fantasia. After a brief visit to the world of 'Wizard of Oz' rip-offs, Richter is transported back to Earth along with a hairy flying dragon, two gnomes, a talking tree who never shuts up and a baby made of rocks. This pudding-headed duffer is a load of old rubbish, not helped along by lazy plotting, Peter Macdonald's heavy-handed direction or the lacklustre acting. Only Jack Black, as a bully, and Melody Kay, as Richter's step-sister (yep, it's a boring dysfunctional family subplot) enliven proceedings. About as magical as a kick in the balls, frankly.

    This movie was so horribly done I was waiting for the moment for it to be over with. It was pretty torturous, from the bad acting, lame jokes trying to be "hip" to flat out disappointment in character development. This movie is just an embarrassment. I don't even associate this nor the NES II with the NES I(which was the only good one). The series could have been great if it was consistent in actors & quality. I think I'm going to go cry about the hour I wasted watching this movie. This site asks for my review to be at lest 10 lines.... How much can you write about a movie that sucked so bad you were on the edge of your seat waiting for it to be over? I literally just watched it so this review is fresh...and yes it was my first instinct to write a review for this movie so no on else has to suffer.

    I'm just trying to understand why this movie was made with so little effort. The plot could have worked but these filmmakers totally trashed the lovable concept of the magical Neverending story. The magic that captured me in the first two movies is non existent in this one. I cherished The Neverending Story 1 and 2 when I was a child, and I remember these stories being much more tragic and more magical. In this movie they made the characters a whole lot more silly than they had to be, and they have totally changed the looks of the characters. For instance the stone people were ridiculous and reminded me about Henson's TV-series 'Dinosaurs'. Falcor's looks have totally changed, I'm wondering if they did burn the Falcor puppet from the other movies? The only thing I loved about this movie, was Jack Black's performance. If it wasn't for him I would rate this movie with 0%.

    The first movie wasn't too bad, the second movie was not as good, this one is just plain awful. Let's start out with the villains. They have a level of retardedness as in a lot of children's' movies where they crash into each other a lot and can't keep control of their limbs on every corner as if they're running on ice. Many of the characters that were in the original have had their looks and personalities changed, even some have had their names changed, and there's many inconsistencies. Where's Atreyu? And Bastions' family has for some reason changed from having a dead mother to a dead father. Even the cover for The Neverending Story book has changed and is much thinner than it used to be. The puppetry looks ridiculous and the costume design has the same cheese factor as the early episodes of The Power Rangers. Falcor is no longer the wise luck dragon we remember but is now a clueless abomination that looks stoned. Rock Biter has somehow shrunk from being the size of a 3-story house to the size of a door. I couldn't watch this movie all the way through. It was poorly scripted, poorly acted, the costumes were poorly designed, and the whole movie in general was just plain stupid and dumb and totally destroyed the magic. I'm not surprised that Warner Bros. decided against distributing this, after watching it themselves they probably wanted to gouge their eyes out and have themselves hit on the head with a baseball bat to give them amnesia to forget what they saw and never have to see ever again.

    When I watched a trailer for this movie, I noticed how ironic it is with this quote: "Neverending Fun". Yep, you read that right: "Neverending Fun". More like never ending stupidity! I know what you're thinking: how bad can this movie be? I'll tell you how bad this movie is! This movie is so bad that it makes convicts in a prison look like boy scouts! If Bastian's trying to get to Fantasia(Not to be confused with the 1941 Disney movie), why don't you rename the movie "Neverending Story III: Escape TO Fantasia"?! Are you that dumb?! And why are the villains in the movie a bunch of middle-aged bullies simply named the Nasties? The nasties?!! Did the people who created this movie fell asleep while coming up with the name of the villains?! And here's the worst scene yet: The Rockbiter and his family. What the heck?! There's TV in Fantasia?! How'd ya get TV in Fantasia?! And who knew that the Rockbiter has to sing a song?! What is this anyway, Rockbiter: The Musical?! Why do I even bother watching this movie?! Why, why, why, WHY, WHY?!!!!

    OK, a few years ago I found at Target a package with all three Neverending Story films, also really cheap, so I picked them up. The first film is one of my childhood favorites and still holds up to this day. I'm not alone in this either, I didn't realize what kind of a following the film had and that others watched it as children too. I watched the second one when I got the package and thought it was alright, I also thought the title was pretty funny. Wouldn't it be hilarious if some person got a lawyer for "false advertising" because of the title of the Neverending Story? Anyways, the second one is just an alright film, a little below average but not terrible. Now, something about the third on gave me chills when I grabbed it, I think I should have listened to my instincts. I don't even know where to start with the badness. Now everything that was charming about the first film, throw it out! Everything that was trying to continue the story in the second film, throw it out! This is what was puked up from the two films and it's terrifying. Bastian Balthazar has begun a new chapter in his life. His father has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother, Jane, whose daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. He manages to get them expelled by the janitor after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia, where he is reunited with old friends. However, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm and now plan to steal the amulet to grant their own nasty wishes. See, normally I like bad films, however this was just bad. For God's sake, Valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully and made you feel special, this Valcor looks like a thrown out in the dumpster Chuck-E-Cheese costume. Not to mention the voice is completely different and sounds like some kind of ridicules Gilligan mook. Then the rock monster, who in the first film was the saddest figure, a giant who lost his friends to the Nothing and felt sorrow and spoke so beautiful now has a family, his wife talks like Arnold Schwartzenegger, he's now 1/5 his size and his kid wants to go on a motorcycle ride with him while he sings "Born to be Wild". The villain is no longer an entity; it's a group of bullies called The Nasties being led by Jack Black (LOL). There is nothing redeeming about this film. The acting is terrible and the only decent enough performance is Jack Black who you can understand why he was successful because as much of a bad story as this is, he looked like he was having fun. The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short, the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice, stick to the first film, it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either, it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie: We must not give into the Nasty! 1/10

    Okay, this film is really just for kids with the creatures, the fantasy, and ridiculous storyline about a magical storybook. Anyway, Jack Black is a surprise here in one his earliest films where he plays the leader of the nasties. He and his gang of tattooed high school failures are called the nasties and terrorize the kids in school. This time, they terrorized poor Bastian who is new and has a new family including a stepsister whose not so keen on the new family addition of stepfather and brother in her mother's household. Anyway, the film plot is boring. It never really develops nor do we care too. There is too much in the fantasy world of Fantasia where Bastian goes to escape the Nasties and returns with a couple of them to Earth. When the Nasties get a hold of the special magical book, they are tempted to make changes and alter two worlds. A silly film for kids only. Maybe they'll get it.

    How I wish this movie never existed. So how many things are wrong with nes III? OK, every single problem with this trash's waste makes up one person. We would have the population of China, SQUARED. No, CUBED!!! Why is it bad? Here are a couple reasons why. 1. They turned Falcor into a complete retard. Falcor was supposed to be mystical and wise. In this one however, he is the equivalent of Patrick Star. 2. The rockbiter (or the rockchewer in this crapfest) is nowhere near the same one I know and love from the first movie. He rides on a motorcycle SINGING. In case you're wondering, I'm not joking. Watch it for yourself. 3. The villains are unimaginative. In NES I, the villain was an abstract entity. In II, the villain was in human form. In this one, they're just school bullies. I'm dead serious. Don't believe me? See this movie and watch it for yourself. 4. Inconsistencies. Count the stars. Then square that. That's how many of those you'll find in this movie. 5. Bastian is useless in this movie. He does absolutely nothing to try and help the situation he is in. He doesn't take advantage of the wishes he could be making. Even the NASTIES are more heroes in this movie because they take advantage of what they have. That's why I want The NeverEnding Story III to never exist. This crap gets a doesn't deserve to be on IMDb, the dictionary, brains, the earth, the galaxy, the universe, and if we have one, GOD. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT EXIST!!!

    this is pure crap! I swear the creator of the movie was drunk when he made this! I'm convinced! I saw the first movie,it was beautiful,the second one was not great,but it's A lot better than this,at least the second movie had better puppets and settings.The third movie just had no effort. The only thing I liked in this movie was Jack Black and thats it. But there are many things I hate about this! First of all,the characters are annoying as hell,Bastian,His step-sister,Falcor,the rockbaby,there are just too many characters to count. And Atreyu is not in it,but if he was, I bet they would just make him look like Macauly Culkin and turn him into a pussy But my BIGGEST problem with this movie is Falcor and The Rock Biter They turned them into idiots! Falcor was wise and brave in the first movie,but in this movie,he's now Patrick the starfish.and the puppet for Falcor,don't even get me started! Same goes for the Rock Biter! The Rock Biter now has a family! He's living in a sitcom now!and his family,they just sound so...so,well,the wife sounds like a man and the baby,oh god the baby..... But, when the rockbiter started singing Born to Be Wild,That's when i pulled out chunks of my hair! Just watch Neverending story 1 and 3 together and look at the difference This movie isn't even a 1,it's a -100,it's the worst sequel in cinema history!

    Fans of The NeverEnding Story are likely to be disappointed by this third installment which differs completely from it's predecessors in turns of characterization and tone. Whilst the first sequel may not have lived up to some expectations, it did at least contain that same sense of wonder and fantastical charm that enriched the original. This third entry abandons our awe in favor of gags and goofs. Bastian this time around is played by Jason James Richter of 'Free Willy' fame. His father has remarried and he has subsequently acquired a teenage step-sister. It's not long before Bastian and his extended family are caught up in Fantasia, his land of imagination. Particularly when a group of comical high school bullies, led by Jack Back, steal The NeverEnding Story book and create havoc in both Fantasia and our world. The creature design this time is by the Jim Henson workshop. Sadly, their renditions of the inhabitants of Fantasia and indeed their personalities are inconsistent with the previous entries. For example, Falkor is reduced from being a noble and brave luck-dragon to a whiny and cowardly puppy dog. And this is what hurts the film the most. To the younger viewer it will be a mildly amusing affair, but to those who have followed the film series, it will appear to be a complete deviation that will have you aching for the Fantasia of old. The actors all turn in good performances but you feel they would all be best served by a more earnest script that employed plot lines from the Michael Ende's novel. Still, it's far superior to the live action television series that would later follow.

    For a film that bleats on about the importance of imagination, this third instalment in the tacky fantasy series has precious little of its own. This vomit-inducing series was unbearable back in the mid-'80s so God knows why anyone thought it would survive the '90s. This time Bastian (Jason James Richter, the third actor to play the part in as many films) gets plunged into another cheesy adventure when the Neverending Story book is stolen by school bullies, who start causing havoc in the soppy land of Fantasia. After a brief visit to the world of 'Wizard of Oz' rip-offs, Richter is transported back to Earth along with a hairy flying dragon, two gnomes, a talking tree who never shuts up and a baby made of rocks. This pudding-headed duffer is a load of old rubbish, not helped along by lazy plotting, Peter Macdonald's heavy-handed direction or the lacklustre acting. Only Jack Black, as a bully, and Melody Kay, as Richter's step-sister (yep, it's a boring dysfunctional family subplot) enliven proceedings. About as magical as a kick in the balls, frankly.

And Atreyu is not in it,but if he was, I bet they would just make him look like Macauly Culkin and turn him into a pussy But my BIGGEST problem with this movie is Falcor and The Rock Biter They turned them into idiots! Falcor was wise and brave in the first movie,but in this movie,he's now Patrick the starfish.and the puppet for Falcor,don't even get me started! Same goes for the Rock Biter! The Rock Biter now has a family! He's living in a sitcom now!and his family,they just sound so...so,well,the wife sounds like a man and the baby,oh god the baby..... But, when the rockbiter started singing Born to Be Wild,That's when i pulled out chunks of my hair! Just watch Neverending story 1 and 3 together and look at the difference This movie isn't even a 1,it's a -100,it's the worst sequel in cinema history!
