 <sinopse>
  Two tapes, two Parisian mob killers, one corrupt policeman, an opera fan, a teenage thief, and the coolest philosopher ever filmed. All these characters twist their way through an intricate and stylish French language thriller.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Young Parisian mail courier is content with his bohemian lifestyle, his circle of friends and listening to opera, particularly one exceptional American diva who refuses to be recorded. So enamored with her, he makes an illegal tape of her at a concert. But when the tape is confused with one implicating a police chief with the mob, he must use all his ingenuity to survive. Particularly notable for its stylish New-Wave production values and extended motorcycle chase scene.

    A different film. Lovely film typical from the 80's. Interesting because the main character was driving a moped and listening to classical music on it. Another character intoned puzzle as big as the floor of a room, which was the image of a wave against the sky and a little white bird between them. There was a small Chinese girl who wants to be a woman. There was also a black woman, a very good opera singer (the diva!). There was little action, praising record technology and more opera. Interesting scenery, a clash between the highest idealistic forms of human thought with monotonous everyday life giving birth to haters, crimes, corruption, prostitution.It was very art film. But it's worth watching.

    The french touch of the new wave era. A story built around Catallani's La Wally aria with a Diva who never makes records, some notorious businessmen from Taiwan, a corrupted chief policeman and a postman, all skillfully webbed. Inspired and inspiring, fresh, edgy and stylish nourished my personal myth (i even thought of becoming a postman!) and i must admit it still does. There is an undoubted elegance throughout the film that leaves a gentle savor so sensually purifying. I envy so much the morning walk among the statues in the awakening Paris. NOT TO BE MISSED

    The first time I saw "Diva" I hated it so much I walked out with only 10 minutes to go because I didn't want to waste another minute of my life. I saw it again last night, years later, and for the life of me couldn't figure out why I had hated it so much. "Diva" is a very stylish, very esoteric, very "French" film. So if any of those descriptions scare you, you might end up hating it. On the flip side, beware if you're a hardcore art film fan, because this movie is also a straightforward crime/action flick. So if the phrase "action flick" makes you cringe, you might end up hating it also. In other words, "Diva" straddles the worlds of Godard ("Contempt") and Michael Bay ("The Transformers"). And it has the potential to offend anyone who hates either extreme. The plot, based on the 1979 novel "Diva" by Daniel Odier, is about a young moped-riding hero who finds himself in possession of two different tapes, one wanted by criminal gangsters and the other wanted by equally vicious corporate suits. The kid himself is mostly clueless, but he is taken under the wing of a mysterious millionaire who gets involved... sort of a Bruce Wayne without the Bat outfit. The "Diva" in the title is an opera singer who is played and, even more impressively, *sung* by the amazing Wilhelmenia Fernandez who in real life is known for her haunting rendition of "La Wally" as sung in this film. She is the one whose voice ends up on a bootleg tape, which is wanted by the corporate suits, who are chasing our hero, who is also running from gangsters, who want a different tape he has. If the plot sounds tricky, perhaps comical, that's because it is. There are a lot of twists, turns, criss-crosses and surprises to keep you entertained. And while there aren't any outright punchlines and gags, there are some bits of humor and over-the-top characterizations that can only be interpreted as satirical. Example: the grumpy gangster played by the awesome Dominique Pinon whose only lines seem to be: "I hate cops", "I hate Beethoven", "I hate parking decks", and so forth (stick around til the end to find out evidently the 1 thing he likes). But the real reason to enjoy this film is its artistic, stylish presentation. Directed by Jean-Jacques Beneix, this is perhaps his best example of a film style he practically defined in the 80s, known as "cin&eacute;ma du look". This style is characterized by non-naturalistic, self-conscious aesthetics, notably intense colors and lighting effects. For example, the millionaire's loft is drenched in vivid blues. The city chase scenes seem to have an eery, artificial red/pink hue. And the Diva's rooms are a high-contrast, Kubrickian white. Everyone in this movie is cool. Like too-cool-for-school cool. It glorifies classical music fans, gangsters, hipsters, rich folks, poor folks, Americans, Koreans, French, kleptomaniacs, prostitutes, good guys, bad guys, and everyone except that one poor slob who works at the carnival. Everyone is cool and in control. Add to that the creative camera shots, for example lots of reflections (in the bad guys' sunglasses, or in the hubcap of a car, etc), and there you definitely have "stylish". The music is artistic, but artistic in a very 80s sort of way (almost pop, a little bit cheezy at times but still cool). And of course Wilhelmenia's singing of the operatic piece from "La Wally" is gorgeous, and the film opens with a generous music-only scene where we can truly enjoy it. So, upon my 2nd viewing, I recommend this film. I think the only reason why I hated it at first was because I was comparing it to Beneix's 1986 masterpiece "Betty Blue" (37&deg;2 le matin), which digs much deeper into poetry and character development, while sacrificing the intense plot that "Diva" has. I would compare "Diva" to the more plot-oriented films of Wim Wenders ("Faraway, So Close", "Until the End of the World", "End of Violence") and Ridley Scott of the 80s ("Black Rain", "Someone to Watch Over Me" ...incidentally Wilhelmenia Fernandez was also on the soundtrack of that one, singing "La Wally"). With "Diva"'s exaggerated colors and large sets, I might also compare it to the visual style--visuals only--of Jean-Pierre Jeunet ("City of Lost Children", "Amelie"), Tom Tykwer ("Winter Sleepers", "Run Lola Run") and the talented Japanese filmmaker Hideaki Anno ("Ritual"). There might even be a dash of Kieslowski ("The Double Life of Veronique", "Three Colors"). If you like any of the films or directors I've mentioned, you should give "Diva" a shot. And if you hate it the first time, be sure to try it again a few years later.

    In the same way 'The Breakfast Club' defined a certain kind of 1980s American filmmaking, and 'Blow Up' defined 1960s hipness, 'Diva' defined a certain kind of 1980s European cinema. That doesn't mean it's great, just seminal. It marked a turning away from deep psychology, philosophy, politics or even plot, and marked an emphasis on style, energy, colors, etc. The movie is about being a cool movie, with cool sets, cool shots, a cool car chase, etc. The plot is just enough to hold it all together. All that said, it is great to look at, the chase is fun, and the film is fun too, in an empty calorie, music video sort of way. It's frustrating. If the acting was a little better (the leads range from pretty good to very awkward) and the story had a little more heart and brains, it could have kept it's grand style, and been a great film, not just an entertaining, great looking film.

    A young opera lover surreptitiously tapes the performance of a diva. The famous singer has never been recorded before believing that art should be experienced live not reproduced; unsurprisingly she is livid when she discovers there is a bootleg of her performance out there. Add to the mix two Taiwanese mafia hoods who want the tape and two French gangsters who are on the hunt for a different tape that gets mixed up in the chaos; their tape exposes corruption in high places, including the international trafficking of women into prostitution. The plot line in Diva isn't probably it's strongest point. It's fairly convoluted and artificial. However, this doesn't matter too much in the final analysis. Diva was one of the most prominent films in the cin&eacute;ma du look movement that was popular in France in the 1980's. These were films that were all about surface sheen and stylishness. They didn't put nearly as much focus on depth, the image was always elevated above almost everything else. The films of Luc Besson were maybe the most famous but Diva was one of the first and most influential. I have always had a fondness for movies that favour cinematic style over all other considerations, so it is perhaps unsurprising that I enjoyed this one. There are some good set-pieces, some elaborate sets and interesting fusions of old with new and high art with commercial reproduction. With it's combination of Pop Art imagery, eccentric characters and beautiful Parisian locations, Diva has a lot going for it so long as you don't go into it expecting any focus on realism.

    Overambition is always risky. Diva is so plot heavy that it almost cracks, but it is delicious and entertaining. As far as genre is concerned, this movie flirts with several, but I think it is safe to label Diva as essentially a neo noir. It is darkly romantic, full of corruption, and photographed in spectacular fashion. The colours are rich and the camera work is exquisite. The movie is almost great but not quite. In an attempt to bring everything together, it has a little climax trouble. A tape of evidence with exposes the Chief inspector of Paris as crooked ends up in the moped satchel of a mail boy named Jules, who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by goons with guns. But that's not his only problem. Jules has made a secret recording of his favourite opera singer live in concert. This singer has blatantly refused to do any recordings, and when word gets out that such a recording exists, different people are going after it. It is ever more essential that Jules keep it hidden, considering, that he and his singer friend have become intimate friends. Even though Diva enjoys piling it up by the pound, it does so in a compelling fashion. It is a good balance of bold and slick. There are a few clich&eacute;s buried beneath the labyrinth plot that a picky person may be drawn to pick out, but I enjoyed Diva for its sense of non- convention. It puts character before character type, and tension above twist. Cinematography plays an exceptional role in this motion picture, which captures Paris in a far more exuberant way than I am used to seeing (and I've been there). One item about the city which has never appeal to me is that it is very grey, with not enough green. Grey is the last of the colours on Diva's colour pallet (execpt when necessary). This motion picture prefers something a little more romantic or expressive. like a jazzy blue, or a fiery red. I can easily give Diva a pass, and I can recommend it on numerous grounds. As a non-Hollywood thriller, Diva is exceptional, but it is not a film for the soft minded. It gets a bit too convoluted, not too messy, but there is a sense that it could use a slight reworking. This is not a light motion picture, but it ain't a dull one either.

    Catalani's opera La Wally has one of the most beautiful arias for a soprano, "Ebben ne andro lontano", which also serves as a theme for this 1981 film we saw when it first came out. The one thing it did was something akin to what happened when Jonathan Demme's "Philadelphia" showcased the aria "La mamma morta", because a lot of non operatic music lovers turn to get recordings featuring the immortal music that have delighted music lovers for ages. Not having seen it since its release, we recently took another look at this satisfying picture. "Diva" is basically a clever thriller in which an elusive soprano, Cynthia Hawkins, is reluctant to make recordings. Because she is such a rarity in our modern world, Ms. Hawkins' disregard to share her vocal gifts with the public at large, elicit all kinds of illegal recordings because ardent fans will go to whatever extreme necessary to capture her voice for their own pleasure, or perhaps to sell it to unscrupulous merchants for a profit. Jules, the intense young man, is seen going to the recital Cynthia Hawkins is offering. He has a hidden recording device. There are two Chinese men that are also interested in getting their hands in the material; they will stop at nothing to get what they want. When Jules meets Nadia, an adventurous young woman, she brings Jules to meet Gorodish, a strange man she has been living with. The trio go into an adventure that will take them all over Paris trying to protect Jules' treasure from falling in the wrong hands. After gaining Cynthia's friendship, Jules confesses he is the one responsible for stealing her gown from the recital, something that elates her because she finds the young man's attention flattering. What's more, she has never heard her recorded voice, something that only Jules will help remedy. This was Jean-Jacques Beineix's second film. We thought that after "Diva" became such an international hit, he would go to bigger things, but alas, nothing happened. His other films have not done as well. In fact, with the exception of "Betty Blue", we have not seen any of his other films. The director contributed to the adaptation of the film. Frederic Andrei is a personable actor that kept reminding us of Jean-Pierre Leaud, perhaps a comparison to other movie watchers. Evidently, Mr. Andrei decided to go for a television career, something one wouldn't have expected based on his appearance in this movie. Richard Bohringer and Chantal Deruaz make good contributions to the enjoyment of the film. Wilhemina Fernandez Wiggins, a singer in her own right, appears as the gorgeous goddess-like figure of Cynthia Hawkins.

    This film has loads of style and some quirky humour. It doesn't make much sense from time to time, but it does keep you watching. It's set in Paris and it's an intrigue chase type thriller. There are twists and turns galore. I liked the Paris montage, but there is opera and I liked this less. To listen and see a scene of a woman singing arias may be music to some people, but not to others like me; however she is a most beautiful woman so at least that kept my attention. This movie is like a bag of potato chips, it's tasty and but once the bag is empty you toss it out.

    This film isn't about piracy, prostitution, blackmail or even murder- although it has loads of all that. At its heart, Diva is about music- no, not the loud jarring sort but the kind that occupies the space between silences. And we don't just listen to it; what is more, we actually see this music: in the eerie emptiness of Diva's cinematography; in the uncluttered labyrinth of Parisian urban lofts; on an enchanted castle by the sea; in the surprisingly meaningful relationships between strangers; and in the wild applause of an empty opera house. Beineix's weaves a world that is, for lack of a better word, hypnotic. And we, his viewers, simply drift through it.

    Not everyone's taste but this film has it all at whatever level you want if you just prompt your imagination the teeniest little bit. All you need is an unknown young lead actor who will never be seen again, character acting in support that just drools its nationality and fruity flavour and an American Diva with a great singing voice. Oh I forgot the Metro chase for visual effect and the most convoluted and deliberately surreal plot (and filming) and hey presto its like nothing else. It was probably considered too commercial to win French awards and too French to win global ones but this film induces a breathlessness that you can feel from the start. Yet it is so tongue in cheek, poking fun at the early 80s France.

One item about the city which has never appeal to me is that it is very grey, with not enough green. Grey is the last of the colours on Diva's colour pallet (execpt when necessary). This motion picture prefers something a little more romantic or expressive. like a jazzy blue, or a fiery red. I can easily give Diva a pass, and I can recommend it on numerous grounds. As a non-Hollywood thriller, Diva is exceptional, but it is not a film for the soft minded. It gets a bit too convoluted, not too messy, but there is a sense that it could use a slight reworking. This is not a light motion picture, but it ain't a dull one either.

    Catalani's opera La Wally has one of the most beautiful arias for a soprano, "Ebben ne andro lontano", which also serves as a theme for this 1981 film we saw when it first came out. The one thing it did was something akin to what happened when Jonathan Demme's "Philadelphia" showcased the aria "La mamma morta", because a lot of non operatic music lovers turn to get recordings featuring the immortal music that have delighted music lovers for ages. Not having seen it since its release, we recently took another look at this satisfying picture. "Diva" is basically a clever thriller in which an elusive soprano, Cynthia Hawkins, is reluctant to make recordings. Because she is such a rarity in our modern world, Ms. Hawkins' disregard to share her vocal gifts with the public at large, elicit all kinds of illegal recordings because ardent fans will go to whatever extreme necessary to capture her voice for their own pleasure, or perhaps to sell it to unscrupulous merchants for a profit. Jules, the intense young man, is seen going to the recital Cynthia Hawkins is offering. He has a hidden recording device. There are two Chinese men that are also interested in getting their hands in the material; they will stop at nothing to get what they want. When Jules meets Nadia, an adventurous young woman, she brings Jules to meet Gorodish, a strange man she has been living with. The trio go into an adventure that will take them all over Paris trying to protect Jules' treasure from falling in the wrong hands. After gaining Cynthia's friendship, Jules confesses he is the one responsible for stealing her gown from the recital, something that elates her because she finds the young man's attention flattering. What's more, she has never heard her recorded voice, something that only Jules will help remedy. This was Jean-Jacques Beineix's second film. We thought that after "Diva" became such an international hit, he would go to bigger things, but alas, nothing happened. His other films have not done as well. In fact, with the exception of "Betty Blue", we have not seen any of his other films. The director contributed to the adaptation of the film. Frederic Andrei is a personable actor that kept reminding us of Jean-Pierre Leaud, perhaps a comparison to other movie watchers. Evidently, Mr. Andrei decided to go for a television career, something one wouldn't have expected based on his appearance in this movie. Richard Bohringer and Chantal Deruaz make good contributions to the enjoyment of the film. Wilhemina Fernandez Wiggins, a singer in her own right, appears as the gorgeous goddess-like figure of Cynthia Hawkins.

    This film has loads of style and some quirky humour. It doesn't make much sense from time to time, but it does keep you watching. It's set in Paris and it's an intrigue chase type thriller. There are twists and turns galore. I liked the Paris montage, but there is opera and I liked this less. To listen and see a scene of a woman singing arias may be music to some people, but not to others like me; however she is a most beautiful woman so at least that kept my attention. This movie is like a bag of potato chips, it's tasty and but once the bag is empty you toss it out.

    This film isn't about piracy, prostitution, blackmail or even murder- although it has loads of all that. At its heart, Diva is about music- no, not the loud jarring sort but the kind that occupies the space between silences. And we don't just listen to it; what is more, we actually see this music: in the eerie emptiness of Diva's cinematography; in the uncluttered labyrinth of Parisian urban lofts; on an enchanted castle by the sea; in the surprisingly meaningful relationships between strangers; and in the wild applause of an empty opera house. Beineix's weaves a world that is, for lack of a better word, hypnotic. And we, his viewers, simply drift through it.

    Not everyone's taste but this film has it all at whatever level you want if you just prompt your imagination the teeniest little bit. All you need is an unknown young lead actor who will never be seen again, character acting in support that just drools its nationality and fruity flavour and an American Diva with a great singing voice. Oh I forgot the Metro chase for visual effect and the most convoluted and deliberately surreal plot (and filming) and hey presto its like nothing else. It was probably considered too commercial to win French awards and too French to win global ones but this film induces a breathlessness that you can feel from the start. Yet it is so tongue in cheek, poking fun at the early 80s France.

    A different film. Lovely film typical from the 80's. Interesting because the main character was driving a moped and listening to classical music on it. Another character intoned puzzle as big as the floor of a room, which was the image of a wave against the sky and a little white bird between them. There was a small Chinese girl who wants to be a woman. There was also a black woman, a very good opera singer (the diva!). There was little action, praising record technology and more opera. Interesting scenery, a clash between the highest idealistic forms of human thought with monotonous everyday life giving birth to haters, crimes, corruption, prostitution.It was very art film. But it's worth watching.

    The french touch of the new wave era. A story built around Catallani's La Wally aria with a Diva who never makes records, some notorious businessmen from Taiwan, a corrupted chief policeman and a postman, all skillfully webbed. Inspired and inspiring, fresh, edgy and stylish nourished my personal myth (i even thought of becoming a postman!) and i must admit it still does. There is an undoubted elegance throughout the film that leaves a gentle savor so sensually purifying. I envy so much the morning walk among the statues in the awakening Paris. NOT TO BE MISSED

    The first time I saw "Diva" I hated it so much I walked out with only 10 minutes to go because I didn't want to waste another minute of my life. I saw it again last night, years later, and for the life of me couldn't figure out why I had hated it so much. "Diva" is a very stylish, very esoteric, very "French" film. So if any of those descriptions scare you, you might end up hating it. On the flip side, beware if you're a hardcore art film fan, because this movie is also a straightforward crime/action flick. So if the phrase "action flick" makes you cringe, you might end up hating it also. In other words, "Diva" straddles the worlds of Godard ("Contempt") and Michael Bay ("The Transformers"). And it has the potential to offend anyone who hates either extreme. The plot, based on the 1979 novel "Diva" by Daniel Odier, is about a young moped-riding hero who finds himself in possession of two different tapes, one wanted by criminal gangsters and the other wanted by equally vicious corporate suits. The kid himself is mostly clueless, but he is taken under the wing of a mysterious millionaire who gets involved... sort of a Bruce Wayne without the Bat outfit. The "Diva" in the title is an opera singer who is played and, even more impressively, *sung* by the amazing Wilhelmenia Fernandez who in real life is known for her haunting rendition of "La Wally" as sung in this film. She is the one whose voice ends up on a bootleg tape, which is wanted by the corporate suits, who are chasing our hero, who is also running from gangsters, who want a different tape he has. If the plot sounds tricky, perhaps comical, that's because it is. There are a lot of twists, turns, criss-crosses and surprises to keep you entertained. And while there aren't any outright punchlines and gags, there are some bits of humor and over-the-top characterizations that can only be interpreted as satirical. Example: the grumpy gangster played by the awesome Dominique Pinon whose only lines seem to be: "I hate cops", "I hate Beethoven", "I hate parking decks", and so forth (stick around til the end to find out evidently the 1 thing he likes). But the real reason to enjoy this film is its artistic, stylish presentation. Directed by Jean-Jacques Beneix, this is perhaps his best example of a film style he practically defined in the 80s, known as "cin&eacute;ma du look". This style is characterized by non-naturalistic, self-conscious aesthetics, notably intense colors and lighting effects. For example, the millionaire's loft is drenched in vivid blues. The city chase scenes seem to have an eery, artificial red/pink hue. And the Diva's rooms are a high-contrast, Kubrickian white. Everyone in this movie is cool. Like too-cool-for-school cool. It glorifies classical music fans, gangsters, hipsters, rich folks, poor folks, Americans, Koreans, French, kleptomaniacs, prostitutes, good guys, bad guys, and everyone except that one poor slob who works at the carnival. Everyone is cool and in control. Add to that the creative camera shots, for example lots of reflections (in the bad guys' sunglasses, or in the hubcap of a car, etc), and there you definitely have "stylish". The music is artistic, but artistic in a very 80s sort of way (almost pop, a little bit cheezy at times but still cool). And of course Wilhelmenia's singing of the operatic piece from "La Wally" is gorgeous, and the film opens with a generous music-only scene where we can truly enjoy it. So, upon my 2nd viewing, I recommend this film. I think the only reason why I hated it at first was because I was comparing it to Beneix's 1986 masterpiece "Betty Blue" (37&deg;2 le matin), which digs much deeper into poetry and character development, while sacrificing the intense plot that "Diva" has. I would compare "Diva" to the more plot-oriented films of Wim Wenders ("Faraway, So Close", "Until the End of the World", "End of Violence") and Ridley Scott of the 80s ("Black Rain", "Someone to Watch Over Me" ...incidentally Wilhelmenia Fernandez was also on the soundtrack of that one, singing "La Wally"). With "Diva"'s exaggerated colors and large sets, I might also compare it to the visual style--visuals only--of Jean-Pierre Jeunet ("City of Lost Children", "Amelie"), Tom Tykwer ("Winter Sleepers", "Run Lola Run") and the talented Japanese filmmaker Hideaki Anno ("Ritual"). There might even be a dash of Kieslowski ("The Double Life of Veronique", "Three Colors"). If you like any of the films or directors I've mentioned, you should give "Diva" a shot. And if you hate it the first time, be sure to try it again a few years later.

    In the same way 'The Breakfast Club' defined a certain kind of 1980s American filmmaking, and 'Blow Up' defined 1960s hipness, 'Diva' defined a certain kind of 1980s European cinema. That doesn't mean it's great, just seminal. It marked a turning away from deep psychology, philosophy, politics or even plot, and marked an emphasis on style, energy, colors, etc. The movie is about being a cool movie, with cool sets, cool shots, a cool car chase, etc. The plot is just enough to hold it all together. All that said, it is great to look at, the chase is fun, and the film is fun too, in an empty calorie, music video sort of way. It's frustrating. If the acting was a little better (the leads range from pretty good to very awkward) and the story had a little more heart and brains, it could have kept it's grand style, and been a great film, not just an entertaining, great looking film.

    A young opera lover surreptitiously tapes the performance of a diva. The famous singer has never been recorded before believing that art should be experienced live not reproduced; unsurprisingly she is livid when she discovers there is a bootleg of her performance out there. Add to the mix two Taiwanese mafia hoods who want the tape and two French gangsters who are on the hunt for a different tape that gets mixed up in the chaos; their tape exposes corruption in high places, including the international trafficking of women into prostitution. The plot line in Diva isn't probably it's strongest point. It's fairly convoluted and artificial. However, this doesn't matter too much in the final analysis. Diva was one of the most prominent films in the cin&eacute;ma du look movement that was popular in France in the 1980's. These were films that were all about surface sheen and stylishness. They didn't put nearly as much focus on depth, the image was always elevated above almost everything else. The films of Luc Besson were maybe the most famous but Diva was one of the first and most influential. I have always had a fondness for movies that favour cinematic style over all other considerations, so it is perhaps unsurprising that I enjoyed this one. There are some good set-pieces, some elaborate sets and interesting fusions of old with new and high art with commercial reproduction. With it's combination of Pop Art imagery, eccentric characters and beautiful Parisian locations, Diva has a lot going for it so long as you don't go into it expecting any focus on realism.

    Overambition is always risky. Diva is so plot heavy that it almost cracks, but it is delicious and entertaining. As far as genre is concerned, this movie flirts with several, but I think it is safe to label Diva as essentially a neo noir. It is darkly romantic, full of corruption, and photographed in spectacular fashion. The colours are rich and the camera work is exquisite. The movie is almost great but not quite. In an attempt to bring everything together, it has a little climax trouble. A tape of evidence with exposes the Chief inspector of Paris as crooked ends up in the moped satchel of a mail boy named Jules, who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by goons with guns. But that's not his only problem. Jules has made a secret recording of his favourite opera singer live in concert. This singer has blatantly refused to do any recordings, and when word gets out that such a recording exists, different people are going after it. It is ever more essential that Jules keep it hidden, considering, that he and his singer friend have become intimate friends. Even though Diva enjoys piling it up by the pound, it does so in a compelling fashion. It is a good balance of bold and slick. There are a few clich&eacute;s buried beneath the labyrinth plot that a picky person may be drawn to pick out, but I enjoyed Diva for its sense of non- convention. It puts character before character type, and tension above twist. Cinematography plays an exceptional role in this motion picture, which captures Paris in a far more exuberant way than I am used to seeing (and I've been there). One item about the city which has never appeal to me is that it is very grey, with not enough green. Grey is the last of the colours on Diva's colour pallet (execpt when necessary). This motion picture prefers something a little more romantic or expressive. like a jazzy blue, or a fiery red. I can easily give Diva a pass, and I can recommend it on numerous grounds. As a non-Hollywood thriller, Diva is exceptional, but it is not a film for the soft minded. It gets a bit too convoluted, not too messy, but there is a sense that it could use a slight reworking. This is not a light motion picture, but it ain't a dull one either.

That doesn't mean it's great, just seminal. It marked a turning away from deep psychology, philosophy, politics or even plot, and marked an emphasis on style, energy, colors, etc. The movie is about being a cool movie, with cool sets, cool shots, a cool car chase, etc. The plot is just enough to hold it all together. All that said, it is great to look at, the chase is fun, and the film is fun too, in an empty calorie, music video sort of way. It's frustrating. If the acting was a little better (the leads range from pretty good to very awkward) and the story had a little more heart and brains, it could have kept it's grand style, and been a great film, not just an entertaining, great looking film.

    A young opera lover surreptitiously tapes the performance of a diva. The famous singer has never been recorded before believing that art should be experienced live not reproduced; unsurprisingly she is livid when she discovers there is a bootleg of her performance out there. Add to the mix two Taiwanese mafia hoods who want the tape and two French gangsters who are on the hunt for a different tape that gets mixed up in the chaos; their tape exposes corruption in high places, including the international trafficking of women into prostitution. The plot line in Diva isn't probably it's strongest point. It's fairly convoluted and artificial. However, this doesn't matter too much in the final analysis. Diva was one of the most prominent films in the cin&eacute;ma du look movement that was popular in France in the 1980's. These were films that were all about surface sheen and stylishness. They didn't put nearly as much focus on depth, the image was always elevated above almost everything else. The films of Luc Besson were maybe the most famous but Diva was one of the first and most influential. I have always had a fondness for movies that favour cinematic style over all other considerations, so it is perhaps unsurprising that I enjoyed this one. There are some good set-pieces, some elaborate sets and interesting fusions of old with new and high art with commercial reproduction. With it's combination of Pop Art imagery, eccentric characters and beautiful Parisian locations, Diva has a lot going for it so long as you don't go into it expecting any focus on realism.

    Overambition is always risky. Diva is so plot heavy that it almost cracks, but it is delicious and entertaining. As far as genre is concerned, this movie flirts with several, but I think it is safe to label Diva as essentially a neo noir. It is darkly romantic, full of corruption, and photographed in spectacular fashion. The colours are rich and the camera work is exquisite. The movie is almost great but not quite. In an attempt to bring everything together, it has a little climax trouble. A tape of evidence with exposes the Chief inspector of Paris as crooked ends up in the moped satchel of a mail boy named Jules, who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by goons with guns. But that's not his only problem. Jules has made a secret recording of his favourite opera singer live in concert. This singer has blatantly refused to do any recordings, and when word gets out that such a recording exists, different people are going after it. It is ever more essential that Jules keep it hidden, considering, that he and his singer friend have become intimate friends. Even though Diva enjoys piling it up by the pound, it does so in a compelling fashion. It is a good balance of bold and slick. There are a few clich&eacute;s buried beneath the labyrinth plot that a picky person may be drawn to pick out, but I enjoyed Diva for its sense of non- convention. It puts character before character type, and tension above twist. Cinematography plays an exceptional role in this motion picture, which captures Paris in a far more exuberant way than I am used to seeing (and I've been there). One item about the city which has never appeal to me is that it is very grey, with not enough green. Grey is the last of the colours on Diva's colour pallet (execpt when necessary). This motion picture prefers something a little more romantic or expressive. like a jazzy blue, or a fiery red. I can easily give Diva a pass, and I can recommend it on numerous grounds. As a non-Hollywood thriller, Diva is exceptional, but it is not a film for the soft minded. It gets a bit too convoluted, not too messy, but there is a sense that it could use a slight reworking. This is not a light motion picture, but it ain't a dull one either.

    Catalani's opera La Wally has one of the most beautiful arias for a soprano, "Ebben ne andro lontano", which also serves as a theme for this 1981 film we saw when it first came out. The one thing it did was something akin to what happened when Jonathan Demme's "Philadelphia" showcased the aria "La mamma morta", because a lot of non operatic music lovers turn to get recordings featuring the immortal music that have delighted music lovers for ages. Not having seen it since its release, we recently took another look at this satisfying picture. "Diva" is basically a clever thriller in which an elusive soprano, Cynthia Hawkins, is reluctant to make recordings. Because she is such a rarity in our modern world, Ms. Hawkins' disregard to share her vocal gifts with the public at large, elicit all kinds of illegal recordings because ardent fans will go to whatever extreme necessary to capture her voice for their own pleasure, or perhaps to sell it to unscrupulous merchants for a profit. Jules, the intense young man, is seen going to the recital Cynthia Hawkins is offering. He has a hidden recording device. There are two Chinese men that are also interested in getting their hands in the material; they will stop at nothing to get what they want. When Jules meets Nadia, an adventurous young woman, she brings Jules to meet Gorodish, a strange man she has been living with. The trio go into an adventure that will take them all over Paris trying to protect Jules' treasure from falling in the wrong hands. After gaining Cynthia's friendship, Jules confesses he is the one responsible for stealing her gown from the recital, something that elates her because she finds the young man's attention flattering. What's more, she has never heard her recorded voice, something that only Jules will help remedy. This was Jean-Jacques Beineix's second film. We thought that after "Diva" became such an international hit, he would go to bigger things, but alas, nothing happened. His other films have not done as well. In fact, with the exception of "Betty Blue", we have not seen any of his other films. The director contributed to the adaptation of the film. Frederic Andrei is a personable actor that kept reminding us of Jean-Pierre Leaud, perhaps a comparison to other movie watchers. Evidently, Mr. Andrei decided to go for a television career, something one wouldn't have expected based on his appearance in this movie. Richard Bohringer and Chantal Deruaz make good contributions to the enjoyment of the film. Wilhemina Fernandez Wiggins, a singer in her own right, appears as the gorgeous goddess-like figure of Cynthia Hawkins.

    This film has loads of style and some quirky humour. It doesn't make much sense from time to time, but it does keep you watching. It's set in Paris and it's an intrigue chase type thriller. There are twists and turns galore. I liked the Paris montage, but there is opera and I liked this less. To listen and see a scene of a woman singing arias may be music to some people, but not to others like me; however she is a most beautiful woman so at least that kept my attention. This movie is like a bag of potato chips, it's tasty and but once the bag is empty you toss it out.

    This film isn't about piracy, prostitution, blackmail or even murder- although it has loads of all that. At its heart, Diva is about music- no, not the loud jarring sort but the kind that occupies the space between silences. And we don't just listen to it; what is more, we actually see this music: in the eerie emptiness of Diva's cinematography; in the uncluttered labyrinth of Parisian urban lofts; on an enchanted castle by the sea; in the surprisingly meaningful relationships between strangers; and in the wild applause of an empty opera house. Beineix's weaves a world that is, for lack of a better word, hypnotic. And we, his viewers, simply drift through it.

    Not everyone's taste but this film has it all at whatever level you want if you just prompt your imagination the teeniest little bit. All you need is an unknown young lead actor who will never be seen again, character acting in support that just drools its nationality and fruity flavour and an American Diva with a great singing voice. Oh I forgot the Metro chase for visual effect and the most convoluted and deliberately surreal plot (and filming) and hey presto its like nothing else. It was probably considered too commercial to win French awards and too French to win global ones but this film induces a breathlessness that you can feel from the start. Yet it is so tongue in cheek, poking fun at the early 80s France.

    A different film. Lovely film typical from the 80's. Interesting because the main character was driving a moped and listening to classical music on it. Another character intoned puzzle as big as the floor of a room, which was the image of a wave against the sky and a little white bird between them. There was a small Chinese girl who wants to be a woman. There was also a black woman, a very good opera singer (the diva!). There was little action, praising record technology and more opera. Interesting scenery, a clash between the highest idealistic forms of human thought with monotonous everyday life giving birth to haters, crimes, corruption, prostitution.It was very art film. But it's worth watching.

    The french touch of the new wave era. A story built around Catallani's La Wally aria with a Diva who never makes records, some notorious businessmen from Taiwan, a corrupted chief policeman and a postman, all skillfully webbed. Inspired and inspiring, fresh, edgy and stylish nourished my personal myth (i even thought of becoming a postman!) and i must admit it still does. There is an undoubted elegance throughout the film that leaves a gentle savor so sensually purifying. I envy so much the morning walk among the statues in the awakening Paris. NOT TO BE MISSED

    The first time I saw "Diva" I hated it so much I walked out with only 10 minutes to go because I didn't want to waste another minute of my life. I saw it again last night, years later, and for the life of me couldn't figure out why I had hated it so much. "Diva" is a very stylish, very esoteric, very "French" film. So if any of those descriptions scare you, you might end up hating it. On the flip side, beware if you're a hardcore art film fan, because this movie is also a straightforward crime/action flick. So if the phrase "action flick" makes you cringe, you might end up hating it also. In other words, "Diva" straddles the worlds of Godard ("Contempt") and Michael Bay ("The Transformers"). And it has the potential to offend anyone who hates either extreme. The plot, based on the 1979 novel "Diva" by Daniel Odier, is about a young moped-riding hero who finds himself in possession of two different tapes, one wanted by criminal gangsters and the other wanted by equally vicious corporate suits. The kid himself is mostly clueless, but he is taken under the wing of a mysterious millionaire who gets involved... sort of a Bruce Wayne without the Bat outfit. The "Diva" in the title is an opera singer who is played and, even more impressively, *sung* by the amazing Wilhelmenia Fernandez who in real life is known for her haunting rendition of "La Wally" as sung in this film. She is the one whose voice ends up on a bootleg tape, which is wanted by the corporate suits, who are chasing our hero, who is also running from gangsters, who want a different tape he has. If the plot sounds tricky, perhaps comical, that's because it is. There are a lot of twists, turns, criss-crosses and surprises to keep you entertained. And while there aren't any outright punchlines and gags, there are some bits of humor and over-the-top characterizations that can only be interpreted as satirical. Example: the grumpy gangster played by the awesome Dominique Pinon whose only lines seem to be: "I hate cops", "I hate Beethoven", "I hate parking decks", and so forth (stick around til the end to find out evidently the 1 thing he likes). But the real reason to enjoy this film is its artistic, stylish presentation. Directed by Jean-Jacques Beneix, this is perhaps his best example of a film style he practically defined in the 80s, known as "cin&eacute;ma du look". This style is characterized by non-naturalistic, self-conscious aesthetics, notably intense colors and lighting effects. For example, the millionaire's loft is drenched in vivid blues. The city chase scenes seem to have an eery, artificial red/pink hue. And the Diva's rooms are a high-contrast, Kubrickian white. Everyone in this movie is cool. Like too-cool-for-school cool. It glorifies classical music fans, gangsters, hipsters, rich folks, poor folks, Americans, Koreans, French, kleptomaniacs, prostitutes, good guys, bad guys, and everyone except that one poor slob who works at the carnival. Everyone is cool and in control. Add to that the creative camera shots, for example lots of reflections (in the bad guys' sunglasses, or in the hubcap of a car, etc), and there you definitely have "stylish". The music is artistic, but artistic in a very 80s sort of way (almost pop, a little bit cheezy at times but still cool). And of course Wilhelmenia's singing of the operatic piece from "La Wally" is gorgeous, and the film opens with a generous music-only scene where we can truly enjoy it. So, upon my 2nd viewing, I recommend this film. I think the only reason why I hated it at first was because I was comparing it to Beneix's 1986 masterpiece "Betty Blue" (37&deg;2 le matin), which digs much deeper into poetry and character development, while sacrificing the intense plot that "Diva" has. I would compare "Diva" to the more plot-oriented films of Wim Wenders ("Faraway, So Close", "Until the End of the World", "End of Violence") and Ridley Scott of the 80s ("Black Rain", "Someone to Watch Over Me" ...incidentally Wilhelmenia Fernandez was also on the soundtrack of that one, singing "La Wally"). With "Diva"'s exaggerated colors and large sets, I might also compare it to the visual style--visuals only--of Jean-Pierre Jeunet ("City of Lost Children", "Amelie"), Tom Tykwer ("Winter Sleepers", "Run Lola Run") and the talented Japanese filmmaker Hideaki Anno ("Ritual"). There might even be a dash of Kieslowski ("The Double Life of Veronique", "Three Colors"). If you like any of the films or directors I've mentioned, you should give "Diva" a shot. And if you hate it the first time, be sure to try it again a few years later.

The plot, based on the 1979 novel "Diva" by Daniel Odier, is about a young moped-riding hero who finds himself in possession of two different tapes, one wanted by criminal gangsters and the other wanted by equally vicious corporate suits. The kid himself is mostly clueless, but he is taken under the wing of a mysterious millionaire who gets involved... sort of a Bruce Wayne without the Bat outfit. The "Diva" in the title is an opera singer who is played and, even more impressively, *sung* by the amazing Wilhelmenia Fernandez who in real life is known for her haunting rendition of "La Wally" as sung in this film. She is the one whose voice ends up on a bootleg tape, which is wanted by the corporate suits, who are chasing our hero, who is also running from gangsters, who want a different tape he has. If the plot sounds tricky, perhaps comical, that's because it is. There are a lot of twists, turns, criss-crosses and surprises to keep you entertained. And while there aren't any outright punchlines and gags, there are some bits of humor and over-the-top characterizations that can only be interpreted as satirical. Example: the grumpy gangster played by the awesome Dominique Pinon whose only lines seem to be: "I hate cops", "I hate Beethoven", "I hate parking decks", and so forth (stick around til the end to find out evidently the 1 thing he likes). But the real reason to enjoy this film is its artistic, stylish presentation. Directed by Jean-Jacques Beneix, this is perhaps his best example of a film style he practically defined in the 80s, known as "cin&eacute;ma du look". This style is characterized by non-naturalistic, self-conscious aesthetics, notably intense colors and lighting effects. For example, the millionaire's loft is drenched in vivid blues. The city chase scenes seem to have an eery, artificial red/pink hue. And the Diva's rooms are a high-contrast, Kubrickian white. Everyone in this movie is cool. Like too-cool-for-school cool. It glorifies classical music fans, gangsters, hipsters, rich folks, poor folks, Americans, Koreans, French, kleptomaniacs, prostitutes, good guys, bad guys, and everyone except that one poor slob who works at the carnival. Everyone is cool and in control. Add to that the creative camera shots, for example lots of reflections (in the bad guys' sunglasses, or in the hubcap of a car, etc), and there you definitely have "stylish". The music is artistic, but artistic in a very 80s sort of way (almost pop, a little bit cheezy at times but still cool). And of course Wilhelmenia's singing of the operatic piece from "La Wally" is gorgeous, and the film opens with a generous music-only scene where we can truly enjoy it. So, upon my 2nd viewing, I recommend this film. I think the only reason why I hated it at first was because I was comparing it to Beneix's 1986 masterpiece "Betty Blue" (37&deg;2 le matin), which digs much deeper into poetry and character development, while sacrificing the intense plot that "Diva" has. I would compare "Diva" to the more plot-oriented films of Wim Wenders ("Faraway, So Close", "Until the End of the World", "End of Violence") and Ridley Scott of the 80s ("Black Rain", "Someone to Watch Over Me" ...incidentally Wilhelmenia Fernandez was also on the soundtrack of that one, singing "La Wally"). With "Diva"'s exaggerated colors and large sets, I might also compare it to the visual style--visuals only--of Jean-Pierre Jeunet ("City of Lost Children", "Amelie"), Tom Tykwer ("Winter Sleepers", "Run Lola Run") and the talented Japanese filmmaker Hideaki Anno ("Ritual"). There might even be a dash of Kieslowski ("The Double Life of Veronique", "Three Colors"). If you like any of the films or directors I've mentioned, you should give "Diva" a shot. And if you hate it the first time, be sure to try it again a few years later.

    In the same way 'The Breakfast Club' defined a certain kind of 1980s American filmmaking, and 'Blow Up' defined 1960s hipness, 'Diva' defined a certain kind of 1980s European cinema. That doesn't mean it's great, just seminal. It marked a turning away from deep psychology, philosophy, politics or even plot, and marked an emphasis on style, energy, colors, etc. The movie is about being a cool movie, with cool sets, cool shots, a cool car chase, etc. The plot is just enough to hold it all together. All that said, it is great to look at, the chase is fun, and the film is fun too, in an empty calorie, music video sort of way. It's frustrating. If the acting was a little better (the leads range from pretty good to very awkward) and the story had a little more heart and brains, it could have kept it's grand style, and been a great film, not just an entertaining, great looking film.

    A young opera lover surreptitiously tapes the performance of a diva. The famous singer has never been recorded before believing that art should be experienced live not reproduced; unsurprisingly she is livid when she discovers there is a bootleg of her performance out there. Add to the mix two Taiwanese mafia hoods who want the tape and two French gangsters who are on the hunt for a different tape that gets mixed up in the chaos; their tape exposes corruption in high places, including the international trafficking of women into prostitution. The plot line in Diva isn't probably it's strongest point. It's fairly convoluted and artificial. However, this doesn't matter too much in the final analysis. Diva was one of the most prominent films in the cin&eacute;ma du look movement that was popular in France in the 1980's. These were films that were all about surface sheen and stylishness. They didn't put nearly as much focus on depth, the image was always elevated above almost everything else. The films of Luc Besson were maybe the most famous but Diva was one of the first and most influential. I have always had a fondness for movies that favour cinematic style over all other considerations, so it is perhaps unsurprising that I enjoyed this one. There are some good set-pieces, some elaborate sets and interesting fusions of old with new and high art with commercial reproduction. With it's combination of Pop Art imagery, eccentric characters and beautiful Parisian locations, Diva has a lot going for it so long as you don't go into it expecting any focus on realism.

    Overambition is always risky. Diva is so plot heavy that it almost cracks, but it is delicious and entertaining. As far as genre is concerned, this movie flirts with several, but I think it is safe to label Diva as essentially a neo noir. It is darkly romantic, full of corruption, and photographed in spectacular fashion. The colours are rich and the camera work is exquisite. The movie is almost great but not quite. In an attempt to bring everything together, it has a little climax trouble. A tape of evidence with exposes the Chief inspector of Paris as crooked ends up in the moped satchel of a mail boy named Jules, who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by goons with guns. But that's not his only problem. Jules has made a secret recording of his favourite opera singer live in concert. This singer has blatantly refused to do any recordings, and when word gets out that such a recording exists, different people are going after it. It is ever more essential that Jules keep it hidden, considering, that he and his singer friend have become intimate friends. Even though Diva enjoys piling it up by the pound, it does so in a compelling fashion. It is a good balance of bold and slick. There are a few clich&eacute;s buried beneath the labyrinth plot that a picky person may be drawn to pick out, but I enjoyed Diva for its sense of non- convention. It puts character before character type, and tension above twist. Cinematography plays an exceptional role in this motion picture, which captures Paris in a far more exuberant way than I am used to seeing (and I've been there). One item about the city which has never appeal to me is that it is very grey, with not enough green. Grey is the last of the colours on Diva's colour pallet (execpt when necessary). This motion picture prefers something a little more romantic or expressive. like a jazzy blue, or a fiery red. I can easily give Diva a pass, and I can recommend it on numerous grounds. As a non-Hollywood thriller, Diva is exceptional, but it is not a film for the soft minded. It gets a bit too convoluted, not too messy, but there is a sense that it could use a slight reworking. This is not a light motion picture, but it ain't a dull one either.

    Catalani's opera La Wally has one of the most beautiful arias for a soprano, "Ebben ne andro lontano", which also serves as a theme for this 1981 film we saw when it first came out. The one thing it did was something akin to what happened when Jonathan Demme's "Philadelphia" showcased the aria "La mamma morta", because a lot of non operatic music lovers turn to get recordings featuring the immortal music that have delighted music lovers for ages. Not having seen it since its release, we recently took another look at this satisfying picture. "Diva" is basically a clever thriller in which an elusive soprano, Cynthia Hawkins, is reluctant to make recordings. Because she is such a rarity in our modern world, Ms. Hawkins' disregard to share her vocal gifts with the public at large, elicit all kinds of illegal recordings because ardent fans will go to whatever extreme necessary to capture her voice for their own pleasure, or perhaps to sell it to unscrupulous merchants for a profit. Jules, the intense young man, is seen going to the recital Cynthia Hawkins is offering. He has a hidden recording device. There are two Chinese men that are also interested in getting their hands in the material; they will stop at nothing to get what they want. When Jules meets Nadia, an adventurous young woman, she brings Jules to meet Gorodish, a strange man she has been living with. The trio go into an adventure that will take them all over Paris trying to protect Jules' treasure from falling in the wrong hands. After gaining Cynthia's friendship, Jules confesses he is the one responsible for stealing her gown from the recital, something that elates her because she finds the young man's attention flattering. What's more, she has never heard her recorded voice, something that only Jules will help remedy. This was Jean-Jacques Beineix's second film. We thought that after "Diva" became such an international hit, he would go to bigger things, but alas, nothing happened. His other films have not done as well. In fact, with the exception of "Betty Blue", we have not seen any of his other films. The director contributed to the adaptation of the film. Frederic Andrei is a personable actor that kept reminding us of Jean-Pierre Leaud, perhaps a comparison to other movie watchers. Evidently, Mr. Andrei decided to go for a television career, something one wouldn't have expected based on his appearance in this movie. Richard Bohringer and Chantal Deruaz make good contributions to the enjoyment of the film. Wilhemina Fernandez Wiggins, a singer in her own right, appears as the gorgeous goddess-like figure of Cynthia Hawkins.

    This film has loads of style and some quirky humour. It doesn't make much sense from time to time, but it does keep you watching. It's set in Paris and it's an intrigue chase type thriller. There are twists and turns galore. I liked the Paris montage, but there is opera and I liked this less. To listen and see a scene of a woman singing arias may be music to some people, but not to others like me; however she is a most beautiful woman so at least that kept my attention. This movie is like a bag of potato chips, it's tasty and but once the bag is empty you toss it out.

    This film isn't about piracy, prostitution, blackmail or even murder- although it has loads of all that. At its heart, Diva is about music- no, not the loud jarring sort but the kind that occupies the space between silences. And we don't just listen to it; what is more, we actually see this music: in the eerie emptiness of Diva's cinematography; in the uncluttered labyrinth of Parisian urban lofts; on an enchanted castle by the sea; in the surprisingly meaningful relationships between strangers; and in the wild applause of an empty opera house. Beineix's weaves a world that is, for lack of a better word, hypnotic. And we, his viewers, simply drift through it.

    Not everyone's taste but this film has it all at whatever level you want if you just prompt your imagination the teeniest little bit. All you need is an unknown young lead actor who will never be seen again, character acting in support that just drools its nationality and fruity flavour and an American Diva with a great singing voice. Oh I forgot the Metro chase for visual effect and the most convoluted and deliberately surreal plot (and filming) and hey presto its like nothing else. It was probably considered too commercial to win French awards and too French to win global ones but this film induces a breathlessness that you can feel from the start. Yet it is so tongue in cheek, poking fun at the early 80s France.

    A different film. Lovely film typical from the 80's. Interesting because the main character was driving a moped and listening to classical music on it. Another character intoned puzzle as big as the floor of a room, which was the image of a wave against the sky and a little white bird between them. There was a small Chinese girl who wants to be a woman. There was also a black woman, a very good opera singer (the diva!). There was little action, praising record technology and more opera. Interesting scenery, a clash between the highest idealistic forms of human thought with monotonous everyday life giving birth to haters, crimes, corruption, prostitution.It was very art film. But it's worth watching.

    The french touch of the new wave era. A story built around Catallani's La Wally aria with a Diva who never makes records, some notorious businessmen from Taiwan, a corrupted chief policeman and a postman, all skillfully webbed. Inspired and inspiring, fresh, edgy and stylish nourished my personal myth (i even thought of becoming a postman!) and i must admit it still does. There is an undoubted elegance throughout the film that leaves a gentle savor so sensually purifying. I envy so much the morning walk among the statues in the awakening Paris. NOT TO BE MISSED

    The first time I saw "Diva" I hated it so much I walked out with only 10 minutes to go because I didn't want to waste another minute of my life. I saw it again last night, years later, and for the life of me couldn't figure out why I had hated it so much. "Diva" is a very stylish, very esoteric, very "French" film. So if any of those descriptions scare you, you might end up hating it. On the flip side, beware if you're a hardcore art film fan, because this movie is also a straightforward crime/action flick. So if the phrase "action flick" makes you cringe, you might end up hating it also. In other words, "Diva" straddles the worlds of Godard ("Contempt") and Michael Bay ("The Transformers"). And it has the potential to offend anyone who hates either extreme. The plot, based on the 1979 novel "Diva" by Daniel Odier, is about a young moped-riding hero who finds himself in possession of two different tapes, one wanted by criminal gangsters and the other wanted by equally vicious corporate suits. The kid himself is mostly clueless, but he is taken under the wing of a mysterious millionaire who gets involved... sort of a Bruce Wayne without the Bat outfit. The "Diva" in the title is an opera singer who is played and, even more impressively, *sung* by the amazing Wilhelmenia Fernandez who in real life is known for her haunting rendition of "La Wally" as sung in this film. She is the one whose voice ends up on a bootleg tape, which is wanted by the corporate suits, who are chasing our hero, who is also running from gangsters, who want a different tape he has. If the plot sounds tricky, perhaps comical, that's because it is. There are a lot of twists, turns, criss-crosses and surprises to keep you entertained. And while there aren't any outright punchlines and gags, there are some bits of humor and over-the-top characterizations that can only be interpreted as satirical. Example: the grumpy gangster played by the awesome Dominique Pinon whose only lines seem to be: "I hate cops", "I hate Beethoven", "I hate parking decks", and so forth (stick around til the end to find out evidently the 1 thing he likes).

Beineix's weaves a world that is, for lack of a better word, hypnotic. And we, his viewers, simply drift through it.

    Not everyone's taste but this film has it all at whatever level you want if you just prompt your imagination the teeniest little bit. All you need is an unknown young lead actor who will never be seen again, character acting in support that just drools its nationality and fruity flavour and an American Diva with a great singing voice. Oh I forgot the Metro chase for visual effect and the most convoluted and deliberately surreal plot (and filming) and hey presto its like nothing else. It was probably considered too commercial to win French awards and too French to win global ones but this film induces a breathlessness that you can feel from the start. Yet it is so tongue in cheek, poking fun at the early 80s France.

    A different film. Lovely film typical from the 80's. Interesting because the main character was driving a moped and listening to classical music on it. Another character intoned puzzle as big as the floor of a room, which was the image of a wave against the sky and a little white bird between them. There was a small Chinese girl who wants to be a woman. There was also a black woman, a very good opera singer (the diva!). There was little action, praising record technology and more opera. Interesting scenery, a clash between the highest idealistic forms of human thought with monotonous everyday life giving birth to haters, crimes, corruption, prostitution.It was very art film. But it's worth watching.

    The french touch of the new wave era. A story built around Catallani's La Wally aria with a Diva who never makes records, some notorious businessmen from Taiwan, a corrupted chief policeman and a postman, all skillfully webbed. Inspired and inspiring, fresh, edgy and stylish nourished my personal myth (i even thought of becoming a postman!) and i must admit it still does. There is an undoubted elegance throughout the film that leaves a gentle savor so sensually purifying. I envy so much the morning walk among the statues in the awakening Paris. NOT TO BE MISSED

    The first time I saw "Diva" I hated it so much I walked out with only 10 minutes to go because I didn't want to waste another minute of my life. I saw it again last night, years later, and for the life of me couldn't figure out why I had hated it so much. "Diva" is a very stylish, very esoteric, very "French" film. So if any of those descriptions scare you, you might end up hating it. On the flip side, beware if you're a hardcore art film fan, because this movie is also a straightforward crime/action flick. So if the phrase "action flick" makes you cringe, you might end up hating it also. In other words, "Diva" straddles the worlds of Godard ("Contempt") and Michael Bay ("The Transformers"). And it has the potential to offend anyone who hates either extreme. The plot, based on the 1979 novel "Diva" by Daniel Odier, is about a young moped-riding hero who finds himself in possession of two different tapes, one wanted by criminal gangsters and the other wanted by equally vicious corporate suits. The kid himself is mostly clueless, but he is taken under the wing of a mysterious millionaire who gets involved... sort of a Bruce Wayne without the Bat outfit. The "Diva" in the title is an opera singer who is played and, even more impressively, *sung* by the amazing Wilhelmenia Fernandez who in real life is known for her haunting rendition of "La Wally" as sung in this film. She is the one whose voice ends up on a bootleg tape, which is wanted by the corporate suits, who are chasing our hero, who is also running from gangsters, who want a different tape he has. If the plot sounds tricky, perhaps comical, that's because it is. There are a lot of twists, turns, criss-crosses and surprises to keep you entertained. And while there aren't any outright punchlines and gags, there are some bits of humor and over-the-top characterizations that can only be interpreted as satirical. Example: the grumpy gangster played by the awesome Dominique Pinon whose only lines seem to be: "I hate cops", "I hate Beethoven", "I hate parking decks", and so forth (stick around til the end to find out evidently the 1 thing he likes). But the real reason to enjoy this film is its artistic, stylish presentation. Directed by Jean-Jacques Beneix, this is perhaps his best example of a film style he practically defined in the 80s, known as "cin&eacute;ma du look". This style is characterized by non-naturalistic, self-conscious aesthetics, notably intense colors and lighting effects. For example, the millionaire's loft is drenched in vivid blues. The city chase scenes seem to have an eery, artificial red/pink hue. And the Diva's rooms are a high-contrast, Kubrickian white. Everyone in this movie is cool. Like too-cool-for-school cool. It glorifies classical music fans, gangsters, hipsters, rich folks, poor folks, Americans, Koreans, French, kleptomaniacs, prostitutes, good guys, bad guys, and everyone except that one poor slob who works at the carnival. Everyone is cool and in control. Add to that the creative camera shots, for example lots of reflections (in the bad guys' sunglasses, or in the hubcap of a car, etc), and there you definitely have "stylish". The music is artistic, but artistic in a very 80s sort of way (almost pop, a little bit cheezy at times but still cool). And of course Wilhelmenia's singing of the operatic piece from "La Wally" is gorgeous, and the film opens with a generous music-only scene where we can truly enjoy it. So, upon my 2nd viewing, I recommend this film. I think the only reason why I hated it at first was because I was comparing it to Beneix's 1986 masterpiece "Betty Blue" (37&deg;2 le matin), which digs much deeper into poetry and character development, while sacrificing the intense plot that "Diva" has. I would compare "Diva" to the more plot-oriented films of Wim Wenders ("Faraway, So Close", "Until the End of the World", "End of Violence") and Ridley Scott of the 80s ("Black Rain", "Someone to Watch Over Me" ...incidentally Wilhelmenia Fernandez was also on the soundtrack of that one, singing "La Wally"). With "Diva"'s exaggerated colors and large sets, I might also compare it to the visual style--visuals only--of Jean-Pierre Jeunet ("City of Lost Children", "Amelie"), Tom Tykwer ("Winter Sleepers", "Run Lola Run") and the talented Japanese filmmaker Hideaki Anno ("Ritual"). There might even be a dash of Kieslowski ("The Double Life of Veronique", "Three Colors"). If you like any of the films or directors I've mentioned, you should give "Diva" a shot. And if you hate it the first time, be sure to try it again a few years later.

    In the same way 'The Breakfast Club' defined a certain kind of 1980s American filmmaking, and 'Blow Up' defined 1960s hipness, 'Diva' defined a certain kind of 1980s European cinema. That doesn't mean it's great, just seminal. It marked a turning away from deep psychology, philosophy, politics or even plot, and marked an emphasis on style, energy, colors, etc. The movie is about being a cool movie, with cool sets, cool shots, a cool car chase, etc. The plot is just enough to hold it all together. All that said, it is great to look at, the chase is fun, and the film is fun too, in an empty calorie, music video sort of way. It's frustrating. If the acting was a little better (the leads range from pretty good to very awkward) and the story had a little more heart and brains, it could have kept it's grand style, and been a great film, not just an entertaining, great looking film.

    A young opera lover surreptitiously tapes the performance of a diva. The famous singer has never been recorded before believing that art should be experienced live not reproduced; unsurprisingly she is livid when she discovers there is a bootleg of her performance out there. Add to the mix two Taiwanese mafia hoods who want the tape and two French gangsters who are on the hunt for a different tape that gets mixed up in the chaos; their tape exposes corruption in high places, including the international trafficking of women into prostitution. The plot line in Diva isn't probably it's strongest point. It's fairly convoluted and artificial. However, this doesn't matter too much in the final analysis. Diva was one of the most prominent films in the cin&eacute;ma du look movement that was popular in France in the 1980's. These were films that were all about surface sheen and stylishness. They didn't put nearly as much focus on depth, the image was always elevated above almost everything else. The films of Luc Besson were maybe the most famous but Diva was one of the first and most influential. I have always had a fondness for movies that favour cinematic style over all other considerations, so it is perhaps unsurprising that I enjoyed this one. There are some good set-pieces, some elaborate sets and interesting fusions of old with new and high art with commercial reproduction. With it's combination of Pop Art imagery, eccentric characters and beautiful Parisian locations, Diva has a lot going for it so long as you don't go into it expecting any focus on realism.

    Overambition is always risky. Diva is so plot heavy that it almost cracks, but it is delicious and entertaining. As far as genre is concerned, this movie flirts with several, but I think it is safe to label Diva as essentially a neo noir. It is darkly romantic, full of corruption, and photographed in spectacular fashion. The colours are rich and the camera work is exquisite. The movie is almost great but not quite. In an attempt to bring everything together, it has a little climax trouble. A tape of evidence with exposes the Chief inspector of Paris as crooked ends up in the moped satchel of a mail boy named Jules, who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by goons with guns. But that's not his only problem. Jules has made a secret recording of his favourite opera singer live in concert. This singer has blatantly refused to do any recordings, and when word gets out that such a recording exists, different people are going after it. It is ever more essential that Jules keep it hidden, considering, that he and his singer friend have become intimate friends. Even though Diva enjoys piling it up by the pound, it does so in a compelling fashion. It is a good balance of bold and slick. There are a few clich&eacute;s buried beneath the labyrinth plot that a picky person may be drawn to pick out, but I enjoyed Diva for its sense of non- convention. It puts character before character type, and tension above twist. Cinematography plays an exceptional role in this motion picture, which captures Paris in a far more exuberant way than I am used to seeing (and I've been there). One item about the city which has never appeal to me is that it is very grey, with not enough green. Grey is the last of the colours on Diva's colour pallet (execpt when necessary). This motion picture prefers something a little more romantic or expressive. like a jazzy blue, or a fiery red. I can easily give Diva a pass, and I can recommend it on numerous grounds. As a non-Hollywood thriller, Diva is exceptional, but it is not a film for the soft minded. It gets a bit too convoluted, not too messy, but there is a sense that it could use a slight reworking. This is not a light motion picture, but it ain't a dull one either.

    Catalani's opera La Wally has one of the most beautiful arias for a soprano, "Ebben ne andro lontano", which also serves as a theme for this 1981 film we saw when it first came out. The one thing it did was something akin to what happened when Jonathan Demme's "Philadelphia" showcased the aria "La mamma morta", because a lot of non operatic music lovers turn to get recordings featuring the immortal music that have delighted music lovers for ages. Not having seen it since its release, we recently took another look at this satisfying picture. "Diva" is basically a clever thriller in which an elusive soprano, Cynthia Hawkins, is reluctant to make recordings. Because she is such a rarity in our modern world, Ms. Hawkins' disregard to share her vocal gifts with the public at large, elicit all kinds of illegal recordings because ardent fans will go to whatever extreme necessary to capture her voice for their own pleasure, or perhaps to sell it to unscrupulous merchants for a profit. Jules, the intense young man, is seen going to the recital Cynthia Hawkins is offering. He has a hidden recording device. There are two Chinese men that are also interested in getting their hands in the material; they will stop at nothing to get what they want. When Jules meets Nadia, an adventurous young woman, she brings Jules to meet Gorodish, a strange man she has been living with. The trio go into an adventure that will take them all over Paris trying to protect Jules' treasure from falling in the wrong hands. After gaining Cynthia's friendship, Jules confesses he is the one responsible for stealing her gown from the recital, something that elates her because she finds the young man's attention flattering. What's more, she has never heard her recorded voice, something that only Jules will help remedy. This was Jean-Jacques Beineix's second film. We thought that after "Diva" became such an international hit, he would go to bigger things, but alas, nothing happened. His other films have not done as well. In fact, with the exception of "Betty Blue", we have not seen any of his other films. The director contributed to the adaptation of the film. Frederic Andrei is a personable actor that kept reminding us of Jean-Pierre Leaud, perhaps a comparison to other movie watchers. Evidently, Mr. Andrei decided to go for a television career, something one wouldn't have expected based on his appearance in this movie. Richard Bohringer and Chantal Deruaz make good contributions to the enjoyment of the film. Wilhemina Fernandez Wiggins, a singer in her own right, appears as the gorgeous goddess-like figure of Cynthia Hawkins.

    This film has loads of style and some quirky humour. It doesn't make much sense from time to time, but it does keep you watching. It's set in Paris and it's an intrigue chase type thriller. There are twists and turns galore. I liked the Paris montage, but there is opera and I liked this less. To listen and see a scene of a woman singing arias may be music to some people, but not to others like me; however she is a most beautiful woman so at least that kept my attention. This movie is like a bag of potato chips, it's tasty and but once the bag is empty you toss it out.
