    Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein "evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty." And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls "facile and penetrating" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin). The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story "stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, "allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to "somewhat uncharacteristic works" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie. (Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that "it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama." Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that "cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again." Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy. (Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion. (Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she "emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca." Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

    This movie was an okay movie, but kind of dragged on a bit and became very disappointing to realize that no "ghost of Rebecca" is anywhere in the film. Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.

    The most sparkling collaboration between one of the greatest producers of all time and one of the greatest directors of all time, David O.Selsnick and Alfred Hitchcock, is unquestionably "Rebecca", the cinematic adaptation of the novel of the same name by Daphne Du Marier. The film stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, two of the greatest Hollywood stars from that time. This is one of those big classic films that perfectly represents a time and a place for this glamorized industry, the year being 1940, a transitional period between Early cinema glamor and Film Noir. A woman in Monte Carlo meets and falls in love with wealthy gentleman Maxim de Winter. The two decide to get married, in spite of the woman knowing that Maxim is a fairly recent and not-yet-recovered widow. When she moves with him in his enormous mansion in England, she feels unwelcome by the housemaids, particularly by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with the first wife of Maxim's, Rebecca. Feeling like a stranger and feeling as if she was constantly being compared to Rebecca, the new wife almost reaches the point of insanity, until she finds out the truth about her death. This stylish film has the charm of the director's best latter films; his playing with shadows and light is masterful, and is early example of the Film Noir look. Perhaps what can be a bit distracting is the lingering score, which doesn't seem to always fit the mood, especially in the tenser scenes. The use of music was probably an element Hitchcock didn't approve of, for he liked his moments of silence to heighten the tenser scenes. However, complaining about such an aspect would be the only rational one to complain about: cinematic technicalities aside, you have a pleasantly intriguing set of characters, from Maxim De Winter himself, played by an always stellar Laurence Olivier, to the stiff coldness of Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson. The fact that Joan Fontaine's character is nameless is an effective strategy on behalf of the writer to make it feel even more as if she was a sort of intruder, a pretty nobody who however couldn't match to the greatness of Rebecca. "Rebecca" is one of Hitchcock's best early films, a movie with a typically British elegance to it- even though this is the director's first film produced by an American-, and it has a special kind of intrigue, especially in its themes concerning the obsession about the past, hidden truths, and ambiguous romance.

    One of Hitchcock's worst. The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons. Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.

    A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today. That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former "partner". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic. Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.

    In case you have not noticed, I am a very huge fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and the films that he makes. So naturally, you would think that I would really like the 1940 mystery Rebecca, the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? But unfortunately, that's just not the case. In fact, I don't really think the Academy Awards are a really credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up that well. I'll go even further by saying that after the two times I've seen this particular film, I've been very underwhelmed by it. Rebecca tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) does not seem to be very fond of the new bride and as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I do admit that this film is far from terrible and that I was invested in the film for about the first couple minutes, it later became too silly and too redundant for my taste. I'll describe more of what I disliked in a moment. What do I like about Rebecca that is worthy of mentioning? I think the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion pretty well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they are supposed to. I also thought Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. Having stated all that, I think the film does go downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and basically sticks to that rhythm for the rest of the picture. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The film practically repeats itself and the narrative as a result becomes less and less interesting, and therefore becomes more of a chore to watch than a pleasure to watch. I didn't even really know what happened in the last half hour of the picture, that's how inconsistent the narrative becomes. For that matter, the conflicts or thrilling parts of the picture were the characters suspect something unusual is happening in the mansion aren't really that exciting. Maybe the reason why is because the story wasn't that thrilling in the first place due to the fact that I don't know if its supposed to be scary. I'm not sure what to feel and how to feel about the events that take place, and as a result, I kind of give up caring and get bored by the film. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a bad Hitchcock picture, I would say that it is an overrated one due to its repetition and lack of any real thrills or anything really interesting for that matter. Given the films that Alfred Hitchcock has made throughout his distinguished career, there are films that he has made that are far more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than Rebecca.

    Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers. A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature. Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.

    I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max. Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day. For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing. Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well) 'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.

    Notice: This may (perhaps to some extent) contain a spoiler, but then again, who wouldn't be familiar with a motion picture seventy years of age? Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way. Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told "Danny" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers. Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one. Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact. Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.

    Before getting to the meat of the movie, I do have to give praise to two of the supporting actors here. Of course, the standout is Judith Anderson(later to be Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. But also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. If you buy the DVD with the "making of" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as "Suspicion", "Shadow Of A Doubt", and "Spellbound". I'll give it ONLY an A, not as A+ that I would give such films as "North By Northwest" and "Vertigo". However, I think it is so much a better film than "Wuthering Heights", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again. Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal. It may be her best film...either that or "Suspicion". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive. The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy shorter performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll. I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife. The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an "8" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!

'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

    This movie was an okay movie, but kind of dragged on a bit and became very disappointing to realize that no "ghost of Rebecca" is anywhere in the film. Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.

    The most sparkling collaboration between one of the greatest producers of all time and one of the greatest directors of all time, David O.Selsnick and Alfred Hitchcock, is unquestionably "Rebecca", the cinematic adaptation of the novel of the same name by Daphne Du Marier. The film stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, two of the greatest Hollywood stars from that time. This is one of those big classic films that perfectly represents a time and a place for this glamorized industry, the year being 1940, a transitional period between Early cinema glamor and Film Noir. A woman in Monte Carlo meets and falls in love with wealthy gentleman Maxim de Winter. The two decide to get married, in spite of the woman knowing that Maxim is a fairly recent and not-yet-recovered widow. When she moves with him in his enormous mansion in England, she feels unwelcome by the housemaids, particularly by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with the first wife of Maxim's, Rebecca. Feeling like a stranger and feeling as if she was constantly being compared to Rebecca, the new wife almost reaches the point of insanity, until she finds out the truth about her death. This stylish film has the charm of the director's best latter films; his playing with shadows and light is masterful, and is early example of the Film Noir look. Perhaps what can be a bit distracting is the lingering score, which doesn't seem to always fit the mood, especially in the tenser scenes. The use of music was probably an element Hitchcock didn't approve of, for he liked his moments of silence to heighten the tenser scenes. However, complaining about such an aspect would be the only rational one to complain about: cinematic technicalities aside, you have a pleasantly intriguing set of characters, from Maxim De Winter himself, played by an always stellar Laurence Olivier, to the stiff coldness of Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson. The fact that Joan Fontaine's character is nameless is an effective strategy on behalf of the writer to make it feel even more as if she was a sort of intruder, a pretty nobody who however couldn't match to the greatness of Rebecca. "Rebecca" is one of Hitchcock's best early films, a movie with a typically British elegance to it- even though this is the director's first film produced by an American-, and it has a special kind of intrigue, especially in its themes concerning the obsession about the past, hidden truths, and ambiguous romance.

    One of Hitchcock's worst. The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons. Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.

    A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today. That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former "partner". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic. Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.

    In case you have not noticed, I am a very huge fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and the films that he makes. So naturally, you would think that I would really like the 1940 mystery Rebecca, the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? But unfortunately, that's just not the case. In fact, I don't really think the Academy Awards are a really credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up that well. I'll go even further by saying that after the two times I've seen this particular film, I've been very underwhelmed by it. Rebecca tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) does not seem to be very fond of the new bride and as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I do admit that this film is far from terrible and that I was invested in the film for about the first couple minutes, it later became too silly and too redundant for my taste. I'll describe more of what I disliked in a moment. What do I like about Rebecca that is worthy of mentioning? I think the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion pretty well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they are supposed to. I also thought Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. Having stated all that, I think the film does go downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and basically sticks to that rhythm for the rest of the picture. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The film practically repeats itself and the narrative as a result becomes less and less interesting, and therefore becomes more of a chore to watch than a pleasure to watch. I didn't even really know what happened in the last half hour of the picture, that's how inconsistent the narrative becomes. For that matter, the conflicts or thrilling parts of the picture were the characters suspect something unusual is happening in the mansion aren't really that exciting. Maybe the reason why is because the story wasn't that thrilling in the first place due to the fact that I don't know if its supposed to be scary. I'm not sure what to feel and how to feel about the events that take place, and as a result, I kind of give up caring and get bored by the film. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a bad Hitchcock picture, I would say that it is an overrated one due to its repetition and lack of any real thrills or anything really interesting for that matter. Given the films that Alfred Hitchcock has made throughout his distinguished career, there are films that he has made that are far more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than Rebecca.

    Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers. A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature. Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.

    I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max. Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day. For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing. Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well) 'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.

    Notice: This may (perhaps to some extent) contain a spoiler, but then again, who wouldn't be familiar with a motion picture seventy years of age? Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way. Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told "Danny" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers. Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one. Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact. Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.

    Before getting to the meat of the movie, I do have to give praise to two of the supporting actors here. Of course, the standout is Judith Anderson(later to be Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. But also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. If you buy the DVD with the "making of" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as "Suspicion", "Shadow Of A Doubt", and "Spellbound". I'll give it ONLY an A, not as A+ that I would give such films as "North By Northwest" and "Vertigo". However, I think it is so much a better film than "Wuthering Heights", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again. Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal. It may be her best film...either that or "Suspicion". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive. The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy shorter performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll. I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife. The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an "8" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!

    Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein "evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty." And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls "facile and penetrating" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin). The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story "stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, "allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to "somewhat uncharacteristic works" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie. (Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that "it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama." Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that "cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again." Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy. (Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion. (Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she "emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca." Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

Rebecca tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) does not seem to be very fond of the new bride and as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I do admit that this film is far from terrible and that I was invested in the film for about the first couple minutes, it later became too silly and too redundant for my taste. I'll describe more of what I disliked in a moment. What do I like about Rebecca that is worthy of mentioning? I think the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion pretty well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they are supposed to. I also thought Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. Having stated all that, I think the film does go downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and basically sticks to that rhythm for the rest of the picture. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The film practically repeats itself and the narrative as a result becomes less and less interesting, and therefore becomes more of a chore to watch than a pleasure to watch. I didn't even really know what happened in the last half hour of the picture, that's how inconsistent the narrative becomes. For that matter, the conflicts or thrilling parts of the picture were the characters suspect something unusual is happening in the mansion aren't really that exciting. Maybe the reason why is because the story wasn't that thrilling in the first place due to the fact that I don't know if its supposed to be scary. I'm not sure what to feel and how to feel about the events that take place, and as a result, I kind of give up caring and get bored by the film. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a bad Hitchcock picture, I would say that it is an overrated one due to its repetition and lack of any real thrills or anything really interesting for that matter. Given the films that Alfred Hitchcock has made throughout his distinguished career, there are films that he has made that are far more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than Rebecca.

    Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers. A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature. Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.

    I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max. Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day. For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing. Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well) 'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.

    Notice: This may (perhaps to some extent) contain a spoiler, but then again, who wouldn't be familiar with a motion picture seventy years of age? Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way. Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told "Danny" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers. Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one. Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact. Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.

    Before getting to the meat of the movie, I do have to give praise to two of the supporting actors here. Of course, the standout is Judith Anderson(later to be Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. But also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. If you buy the DVD with the "making of" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as "Suspicion", "Shadow Of A Doubt", and "Spellbound". I'll give it ONLY an A, not as A+ that I would give such films as "North By Northwest" and "Vertigo". However, I think it is so much a better film than "Wuthering Heights", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again. Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal. It may be her best film...either that or "Suspicion". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive. The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy shorter performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll. I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife. The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an "8" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!

    Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein "evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty." And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls "facile and penetrating" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin). The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story "stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, "allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to "somewhat uncharacteristic works" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie. (Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that "it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama." Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that "cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again." Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy. (Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion. (Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she "emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca." Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

    This movie was an okay movie, but kind of dragged on a bit and became very disappointing to realize that no "ghost of Rebecca" is anywhere in the film. Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.

    The most sparkling collaboration between one of the greatest producers of all time and one of the greatest directors of all time, David O.Selsnick and Alfred Hitchcock, is unquestionably "Rebecca", the cinematic adaptation of the novel of the same name by Daphne Du Marier. The film stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, two of the greatest Hollywood stars from that time. This is one of those big classic films that perfectly represents a time and a place for this glamorized industry, the year being 1940, a transitional period between Early cinema glamor and Film Noir. A woman in Monte Carlo meets and falls in love with wealthy gentleman Maxim de Winter. The two decide to get married, in spite of the woman knowing that Maxim is a fairly recent and not-yet-recovered widow. When she moves with him in his enormous mansion in England, she feels unwelcome by the housemaids, particularly by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with the first wife of Maxim's, Rebecca. Feeling like a stranger and feeling as if she was constantly being compared to Rebecca, the new wife almost reaches the point of insanity, until she finds out the truth about her death. This stylish film has the charm of the director's best latter films; his playing with shadows and light is masterful, and is early example of the Film Noir look. Perhaps what can be a bit distracting is the lingering score, which doesn't seem to always fit the mood, especially in the tenser scenes. The use of music was probably an element Hitchcock didn't approve of, for he liked his moments of silence to heighten the tenser scenes. However, complaining about such an aspect would be the only rational one to complain about: cinematic technicalities aside, you have a pleasantly intriguing set of characters, from Maxim De Winter himself, played by an always stellar Laurence Olivier, to the stiff coldness of Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson. The fact that Joan Fontaine's character is nameless is an effective strategy on behalf of the writer to make it feel even more as if she was a sort of intruder, a pretty nobody who however couldn't match to the greatness of Rebecca. "Rebecca" is one of Hitchcock's best early films, a movie with a typically British elegance to it- even though this is the director's first film produced by an American-, and it has a special kind of intrigue, especially in its themes concerning the obsession about the past, hidden truths, and ambiguous romance.

    One of Hitchcock's worst. The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons. Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.

    A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today. That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former "partner". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic. Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.

    In case you have not noticed, I am a very huge fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and the films that he makes. So naturally, you would think that I would really like the 1940 mystery Rebecca, the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? But unfortunately, that's just not the case. In fact, I don't really think the Academy Awards are a really credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up that well.

Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way. Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told "Danny" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers. Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one. Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact. Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.

    Before getting to the meat of the movie, I do have to give praise to two of the supporting actors here. Of course, the standout is Judith Anderson(later to be Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. But also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. If you buy the DVD with the "making of" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as "Suspicion", "Shadow Of A Doubt", and "Spellbound". I'll give it ONLY an A, not as A+ that I would give such films as "North By Northwest" and "Vertigo". However, I think it is so much a better film than "Wuthering Heights", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again. Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal. It may be her best film...either that or "Suspicion". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive. The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy shorter performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll. I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife. The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an "8" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!

    Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein "evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty." And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls "facile and penetrating" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin). The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story "stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, "allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to "somewhat uncharacteristic works" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie. (Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that "it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama." Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that "cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again." Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy. (Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion. (Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she "emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca." Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

    This movie was an okay movie, but kind of dragged on a bit and became very disappointing to realize that no "ghost of Rebecca" is anywhere in the film. Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.

    The most sparkling collaboration between one of the greatest producers of all time and one of the greatest directors of all time, David O.Selsnick and Alfred Hitchcock, is unquestionably "Rebecca", the cinematic adaptation of the novel of the same name by Daphne Du Marier. The film stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, two of the greatest Hollywood stars from that time. This is one of those big classic films that perfectly represents a time and a place for this glamorized industry, the year being 1940, a transitional period between Early cinema glamor and Film Noir. A woman in Monte Carlo meets and falls in love with wealthy gentleman Maxim de Winter. The two decide to get married, in spite of the woman knowing that Maxim is a fairly recent and not-yet-recovered widow. When she moves with him in his enormous mansion in England, she feels unwelcome by the housemaids, particularly by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with the first wife of Maxim's, Rebecca. Feeling like a stranger and feeling as if she was constantly being compared to Rebecca, the new wife almost reaches the point of insanity, until she finds out the truth about her death. This stylish film has the charm of the director's best latter films; his playing with shadows and light is masterful, and is early example of the Film Noir look. Perhaps what can be a bit distracting is the lingering score, which doesn't seem to always fit the mood, especially in the tenser scenes. The use of music was probably an element Hitchcock didn't approve of, for he liked his moments of silence to heighten the tenser scenes. However, complaining about such an aspect would be the only rational one to complain about: cinematic technicalities aside, you have a pleasantly intriguing set of characters, from Maxim De Winter himself, played by an always stellar Laurence Olivier, to the stiff coldness of Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson. The fact that Joan Fontaine's character is nameless is an effective strategy on behalf of the writer to make it feel even more as if she was a sort of intruder, a pretty nobody who however couldn't match to the greatness of Rebecca. "Rebecca" is one of Hitchcock's best early films, a movie with a typically British elegance to it- even though this is the director's first film produced by an American-, and it has a special kind of intrigue, especially in its themes concerning the obsession about the past, hidden truths, and ambiguous romance.

    One of Hitchcock's worst. The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons. Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.

    A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today. That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former "partner". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic. Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.

    In case you have not noticed, I am a very huge fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and the films that he makes. So naturally, you would think that I would really like the 1940 mystery Rebecca, the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? But unfortunately, that's just not the case. In fact, I don't really think the Academy Awards are a really credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up that well. I'll go even further by saying that after the two times I've seen this particular film, I've been very underwhelmed by it. Rebecca tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) does not seem to be very fond of the new bride and as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I do admit that this film is far from terrible and that I was invested in the film for about the first couple minutes, it later became too silly and too redundant for my taste. I'll describe more of what I disliked in a moment. What do I like about Rebecca that is worthy of mentioning? I think the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion pretty well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they are supposed to. I also thought Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. Having stated all that, I think the film does go downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and basically sticks to that rhythm for the rest of the picture. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The film practically repeats itself and the narrative as a result becomes less and less interesting, and therefore becomes more of a chore to watch than a pleasure to watch. I didn't even really know what happened in the last half hour of the picture, that's how inconsistent the narrative becomes. For that matter, the conflicts or thrilling parts of the picture were the characters suspect something unusual is happening in the mansion aren't really that exciting. Maybe the reason why is because the story wasn't that thrilling in the first place due to the fact that I don't know if its supposed to be scary. I'm not sure what to feel and how to feel about the events that take place, and as a result, I kind of give up caring and get bored by the film. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a bad Hitchcock picture, I would say that it is an overrated one due to its repetition and lack of any real thrills or anything really interesting for that matter. Given the films that Alfred Hitchcock has made throughout his distinguished career, there are films that he has made that are far more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than Rebecca.

    Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers. A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature. Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.

    I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max. Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day. For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing. Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well) 'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.

Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion. (Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she "emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca." Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

    This movie was an okay movie, but kind of dragged on a bit and became very disappointing to realize that no "ghost of Rebecca" is anywhere in the film. Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.

    The most sparkling collaboration between one of the greatest producers of all time and one of the greatest directors of all time, David O.Selsnick and Alfred Hitchcock, is unquestionably "Rebecca", the cinematic adaptation of the novel of the same name by Daphne Du Marier. The film stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, two of the greatest Hollywood stars from that time. This is one of those big classic films that perfectly represents a time and a place for this glamorized industry, the year being 1940, a transitional period between Early cinema glamor and Film Noir. A woman in Monte Carlo meets and falls in love with wealthy gentleman Maxim de Winter. The two decide to get married, in spite of the woman knowing that Maxim is a fairly recent and not-yet-recovered widow. When she moves with him in his enormous mansion in England, she feels unwelcome by the housemaids, particularly by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with the first wife of Maxim's, Rebecca. Feeling like a stranger and feeling as if she was constantly being compared to Rebecca, the new wife almost reaches the point of insanity, until she finds out the truth about her death. This stylish film has the charm of the director's best latter films; his playing with shadows and light is masterful, and is early example of the Film Noir look. Perhaps what can be a bit distracting is the lingering score, which doesn't seem to always fit the mood, especially in the tenser scenes. The use of music was probably an element Hitchcock didn't approve of, for he liked his moments of silence to heighten the tenser scenes. However, complaining about such an aspect would be the only rational one to complain about: cinematic technicalities aside, you have a pleasantly intriguing set of characters, from Maxim De Winter himself, played by an always stellar Laurence Olivier, to the stiff coldness of Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson. The fact that Joan Fontaine's character is nameless is an effective strategy on behalf of the writer to make it feel even more as if she was a sort of intruder, a pretty nobody who however couldn't match to the greatness of Rebecca. "Rebecca" is one of Hitchcock's best early films, a movie with a typically British elegance to it- even though this is the director's first film produced by an American-, and it has a special kind of intrigue, especially in its themes concerning the obsession about the past, hidden truths, and ambiguous romance.

    One of Hitchcock's worst. The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons. Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.

    A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today. That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former "partner". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic. Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.

    In case you have not noticed, I am a very huge fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and the films that he makes. So naturally, you would think that I would really like the 1940 mystery Rebecca, the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? But unfortunately, that's just not the case. In fact, I don't really think the Academy Awards are a really credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up that well. I'll go even further by saying that after the two times I've seen this particular film, I've been very underwhelmed by it. Rebecca tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) does not seem to be very fond of the new bride and as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I do admit that this film is far from terrible and that I was invested in the film for about the first couple minutes, it later became too silly and too redundant for my taste. I'll describe more of what I disliked in a moment. What do I like about Rebecca that is worthy of mentioning? I think the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion pretty well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they are supposed to. I also thought Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. Having stated all that, I think the film does go downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and basically sticks to that rhythm for the rest of the picture. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The film practically repeats itself and the narrative as a result becomes less and less interesting, and therefore becomes more of a chore to watch than a pleasure to watch. I didn't even really know what happened in the last half hour of the picture, that's how inconsistent the narrative becomes. For that matter, the conflicts or thrilling parts of the picture were the characters suspect something unusual is happening in the mansion aren't really that exciting. Maybe the reason why is because the story wasn't that thrilling in the first place due to the fact that I don't know if its supposed to be scary. I'm not sure what to feel and how to feel about the events that take place, and as a result, I kind of give up caring and get bored by the film. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a bad Hitchcock picture, I would say that it is an overrated one due to its repetition and lack of any real thrills or anything really interesting for that matter. Given the films that Alfred Hitchcock has made throughout his distinguished career, there are films that he has made that are far more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than Rebecca.

    Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers. A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature. Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.

    I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max. Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day. For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing. Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well) 'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.

    Notice: This may (perhaps to some extent) contain a spoiler, but then again, who wouldn't be familiar with a motion picture seventy years of age? Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way. Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told "Danny" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers. Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one. Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact. Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.

    Before getting to the meat of the movie, I do have to give praise to two of the supporting actors here. Of course, the standout is Judith Anderson(later to be Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. But also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. If you buy the DVD with the "making of" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as "Suspicion", "Shadow Of A Doubt", and "Spellbound". I'll give it ONLY an A, not as A+ that I would give such films as "North By Northwest" and "Vertigo". However, I think it is so much a better film than "Wuthering Heights", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again. Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal. It may be her best film...either that or "Suspicion". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive. The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy shorter performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll. I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife. The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an "8" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!

    Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein "evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty." And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls "facile and penetrating" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin). The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story "stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, "allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to "somewhat uncharacteristic works" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie. (Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that "it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama." Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that "cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again." Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy. (Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion. (Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures.

'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.

    A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today. That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former "partner". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic. Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.

    In case you have not noticed, I am a very huge fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and the films that he makes. So naturally, you would think that I would really like the 1940 mystery Rebecca, the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? But unfortunately, that's just not the case. In fact, I don't really think the Academy Awards are a really credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up that well. I'll go even further by saying that after the two times I've seen this particular film, I've been very underwhelmed by it. Rebecca tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) does not seem to be very fond of the new bride and as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I do admit that this film is far from terrible and that I was invested in the film for about the first couple minutes, it later became too silly and too redundant for my taste. I'll describe more of what I disliked in a moment. What do I like about Rebecca that is worthy of mentioning? I think the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion pretty well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they are supposed to. I also thought Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. Having stated all that, I think the film does go downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and basically sticks to that rhythm for the rest of the picture. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The film practically repeats itself and the narrative as a result becomes less and less interesting, and therefore becomes more of a chore to watch than a pleasure to watch. I didn't even really know what happened in the last half hour of the picture, that's how inconsistent the narrative becomes. For that matter, the conflicts or thrilling parts of the picture were the characters suspect something unusual is happening in the mansion aren't really that exciting. Maybe the reason why is because the story wasn't that thrilling in the first place due to the fact that I don't know if its supposed to be scary. I'm not sure what to feel and how to feel about the events that take place, and as a result, I kind of give up caring and get bored by the film. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a bad Hitchcock picture, I would say that it is an overrated one due to its repetition and lack of any real thrills or anything really interesting for that matter. Given the films that Alfred Hitchcock has made throughout his distinguished career, there are films that he has made that are far more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than Rebecca.

    Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers. A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature. Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.

    I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max. Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day. For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing. Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well) 'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.

    Notice: This may (perhaps to some extent) contain a spoiler, but then again, who wouldn't be familiar with a motion picture seventy years of age? Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way. Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told "Danny" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers. Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one. Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact. Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.

    Before getting to the meat of the movie, I do have to give praise to two of the supporting actors here. Of course, the standout is Judith Anderson(later to be Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. But also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. If you buy the DVD with the "making of" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as "Suspicion", "Shadow Of A Doubt", and "Spellbound". I'll give it ONLY an A, not as A+ that I would give such films as "North By Northwest" and "Vertigo". However, I think it is so much a better film than "Wuthering Heights", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again. Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal. It may be her best film...either that or "Suspicion". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive. The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy shorter performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll. I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife. The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an "8" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!

    Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein "evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty." And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls "facile and penetrating" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin). The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story "stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, "allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to "somewhat uncharacteristic works" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie. (Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that "it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama." Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that "cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again." Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy. (Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion. (Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she "emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca." Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

    This movie was an okay movie, but kind of dragged on a bit and became very disappointing to realize that no "ghost of Rebecca" is anywhere in the film. Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.

    The most sparkling collaboration between one of the greatest producers of all time and one of the greatest directors of all time, David O.Selsnick and Alfred Hitchcock, is unquestionably "Rebecca", the cinematic adaptation of the novel of the same name by Daphne Du Marier. The film stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, two of the greatest Hollywood stars from that time. This is one of those big classic films that perfectly represents a time and a place for this glamorized industry, the year being 1940, a transitional period between Early cinema glamor and Film Noir. A woman in Monte Carlo meets and falls in love with wealthy gentleman Maxim de Winter. The two decide to get married, in spite of the woman knowing that Maxim is a fairly recent and not-yet-recovered widow. When she moves with him in his enormous mansion in England, she feels unwelcome by the housemaids, particularly by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with the first wife of Maxim's, Rebecca. Feeling like a stranger and feeling as if she was constantly being compared to Rebecca, the new wife almost reaches the point of insanity, until she finds out the truth about her death. This stylish film has the charm of the director's best latter films; his playing with shadows and light is masterful, and is early example of the Film Noir look. Perhaps what can be a bit distracting is the lingering score, which doesn't seem to always fit the mood, especially in the tenser scenes. The use of music was probably an element Hitchcock didn't approve of, for he liked his moments of silence to heighten the tenser scenes. However, complaining about such an aspect would be the only rational one to complain about: cinematic technicalities aside, you have a pleasantly intriguing set of characters, from Maxim De Winter himself, played by an always stellar Laurence Olivier, to the stiff coldness of Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson. The fact that Joan Fontaine's character is nameless is an effective strategy on behalf of the writer to make it feel even more as if she was a sort of intruder, a pretty nobody who however couldn't match to the greatness of Rebecca. "Rebecca" is one of Hitchcock's best early films, a movie with a typically British elegance to it- even though this is the director's first film produced by an American-, and it has a special kind of intrigue, especially in its themes concerning the obsession about the past, hidden truths, and ambiguous romance.

    One of Hitchcock's worst. The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons. Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.

    I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max. Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day. For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing. Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well) 'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.

    Notice: This may (perhaps to some extent) contain a spoiler, but then again, who wouldn't be familiar with a motion picture seventy years of age? Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way. Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told "Danny" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers. Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one. Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact. Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.

    Before getting to the meat of the movie, I do have to give praise to two of the supporting actors here. Of course, the standout is Judith Anderson(later to be Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. But also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. If you buy the DVD with the "making of" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as "Suspicion", "Shadow Of A Doubt", and "Spellbound". I'll give it ONLY an A, not as A+ that I would give such films as "North By Northwest" and "Vertigo". However, I think it is so much a better film than "Wuthering Heights", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again. Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal. It may be her best film...either that or "Suspicion". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive. The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy shorter performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll. I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife. The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an "8" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!

    Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein "evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty." And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls "facile and penetrating" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin). The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story "stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, "allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to "somewhat uncharacteristic works" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie. (Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that "it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama." Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that "cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again." Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy. (Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion. (Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she "emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca." Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

    This movie was an okay movie, but kind of dragged on a bit and became very disappointing to realize that no "ghost of Rebecca" is anywhere in the film. Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.

    The most sparkling collaboration between one of the greatest producers of all time and one of the greatest directors of all time, David O.Selsnick and Alfred Hitchcock, is unquestionably "Rebecca", the cinematic adaptation of the novel of the same name by Daphne Du Marier. The film stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, two of the greatest Hollywood stars from that time. This is one of those big classic films that perfectly represents a time and a place for this glamorized industry, the year being 1940, a transitional period between Early cinema glamor and Film Noir. A woman in Monte Carlo meets and falls in love with wealthy gentleman Maxim de Winter. The two decide to get married, in spite of the woman knowing that Maxim is a fairly recent and not-yet-recovered widow. When she moves with him in his enormous mansion in England, she feels unwelcome by the housemaids, particularly by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with the first wife of Maxim's, Rebecca. Feeling like a stranger and feeling as if she was constantly being compared to Rebecca, the new wife almost reaches the point of insanity, until she finds out the truth about her death. This stylish film has the charm of the director's best latter films; his playing with shadows and light is masterful, and is early example of the Film Noir look. Perhaps what can be a bit distracting is the lingering score, which doesn't seem to always fit the mood, especially in the tenser scenes. The use of music was probably an element Hitchcock didn't approve of, for he liked his moments of silence to heighten the tenser scenes. However, complaining about such an aspect would be the only rational one to complain about: cinematic technicalities aside, you have a pleasantly intriguing set of characters, from Maxim De Winter himself, played by an always stellar Laurence Olivier, to the stiff coldness of Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson. The fact that Joan Fontaine's character is nameless is an effective strategy on behalf of the writer to make it feel even more as if she was a sort of intruder, a pretty nobody who however couldn't match to the greatness of Rebecca. "Rebecca" is one of Hitchcock's best early films, a movie with a typically British elegance to it- even though this is the director's first film produced by an American-, and it has a special kind of intrigue, especially in its themes concerning the obsession about the past, hidden truths, and ambiguous romance.

    One of Hitchcock's worst. The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons. Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.

    A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today. That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former "partner". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic. Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.

    In case you have not noticed, I am a very huge fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and the films that he makes. So naturally, you would think that I would really like the 1940 mystery Rebecca, the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? But unfortunately, that's just not the case. In fact, I don't really think the Academy Awards are a really credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up that well. I'll go even further by saying that after the two times I've seen this particular film, I've been very underwhelmed by it. Rebecca tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) does not seem to be very fond of the new bride and as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I do admit that this film is far from terrible and that I was invested in the film for about the first couple minutes, it later became too silly and too redundant for my taste. I'll describe more of what I disliked in a moment. What do I like about Rebecca that is worthy of mentioning? I think the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion pretty well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they are supposed to. I also thought Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. Having stated all that, I think the film does go downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and basically sticks to that rhythm for the rest of the picture. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The film practically repeats itself and the narrative as a result becomes less and less interesting, and therefore becomes more of a chore to watch than a pleasure to watch. I didn't even really know what happened in the last half hour of the picture, that's how inconsistent the narrative becomes. For that matter, the conflicts or thrilling parts of the picture were the characters suspect something unusual is happening in the mansion aren't really that exciting. Maybe the reason why is because the story wasn't that thrilling in the first place due to the fact that I don't know if its supposed to be scary. I'm not sure what to feel and how to feel about the events that take place, and as a result, I kind of give up caring and get bored by the film. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a bad Hitchcock picture, I would say that it is an overrated one due to its repetition and lack of any real thrills or anything really interesting for that matter. Given the films that Alfred Hitchcock has made throughout his distinguished career, there are films that he has made that are far more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than Rebecca.

    Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers. A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature. Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.

And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls "facile and penetrating" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin). The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story "stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, "allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to "somewhat uncharacteristic works" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie. (Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that "it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama." Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that "cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again." Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy. (Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion. (Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she "emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca." Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances. REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.

    This movie was an okay movie, but kind of dragged on a bit and became very disappointing to realize that no "ghost of Rebecca" is anywhere in the film. Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.

    The most sparkling collaboration between one of the greatest producers of all time and one of the greatest directors of all time, David O.Selsnick and Alfred Hitchcock, is unquestionably "Rebecca", the cinematic adaptation of the novel of the same name by Daphne Du Marier. The film stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, two of the greatest Hollywood stars from that time. This is one of those big classic films that perfectly represents a time and a place for this glamorized industry, the year being 1940, a transitional period between Early cinema glamor and Film Noir. A woman in Monte Carlo meets and falls in love with wealthy gentleman Maxim de Winter. The two decide to get married, in spite of the woman knowing that Maxim is a fairly recent and not-yet-recovered widow. When she moves with him in his enormous mansion in England, she feels unwelcome by the housemaids, particularly by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with the first wife of Maxim's, Rebecca. Feeling like a stranger and feeling as if she was constantly being compared to Rebecca, the new wife almost reaches the point of insanity, until she finds out the truth about her death. This stylish film has the charm of the director's best latter films; his playing with shadows and light is masterful, and is early example of the Film Noir look. Perhaps what can be a bit distracting is the lingering score, which doesn't seem to always fit the mood, especially in the tenser scenes. The use of music was probably an element Hitchcock didn't approve of, for he liked his moments of silence to heighten the tenser scenes. However, complaining about such an aspect would be the only rational one to complain about: cinematic technicalities aside, you have a pleasantly intriguing set of characters, from Maxim De Winter himself, played by an always stellar Laurence Olivier, to the stiff coldness of Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson. The fact that Joan Fontaine's character is nameless is an effective strategy on behalf of the writer to make it feel even more as if she was a sort of intruder, a pretty nobody who however couldn't match to the greatness of Rebecca. "Rebecca" is one of Hitchcock's best early films, a movie with a typically British elegance to it- even though this is the director's first film produced by an American-, and it has a special kind of intrigue, especially in its themes concerning the obsession about the past, hidden truths, and ambiguous romance.

    One of Hitchcock's worst. The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons. Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.

    A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today. That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former "partner". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic. Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.

    In case you have not noticed, I am a very huge fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and the films that he makes. So naturally, you would think that I would really like the 1940 mystery Rebecca, the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? But unfortunately, that's just not the case. In fact, I don't really think the Academy Awards are a really credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up that well. I'll go even further by saying that after the two times I've seen this particular film, I've been very underwhelmed by it. Rebecca tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) does not seem to be very fond of the new bride and as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I do admit that this film is far from terrible and that I was invested in the film for about the first couple minutes, it later became too silly and too redundant for my taste. I'll describe more of what I disliked in a moment. What do I like about Rebecca that is worthy of mentioning? I think the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion pretty well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they are supposed to. I also thought Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. Having stated all that, I think the film does go downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and basically sticks to that rhythm for the rest of the picture. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The film practically repeats itself and the narrative as a result becomes less and less interesting, and therefore becomes more of a chore to watch than a pleasure to watch. I didn't even really know what happened in the last half hour of the picture, that's how inconsistent the narrative becomes. For that matter, the conflicts or thrilling parts of the picture were the characters suspect something unusual is happening in the mansion aren't really that exciting. Maybe the reason why is because the story wasn't that thrilling in the first place due to the fact that I don't know if its supposed to be scary. I'm not sure what to feel and how to feel about the events that take place, and as a result, I kind of give up caring and get bored by the film. While I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a bad Hitchcock picture, I would say that it is an overrated one due to its repetition and lack of any real thrills or anything really interesting for that matter. Given the films that Alfred Hitchcock has made throughout his distinguished career, there are films that he has made that are far more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than Rebecca.

    Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers. A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature. Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.

    I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max. Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day. For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing. Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well) 'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.

    Notice: This may (perhaps to some extent) contain a spoiler, but then again, who wouldn't be familiar with a motion picture seventy years of age? Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way. Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told "Danny" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers. Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one. Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact. Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.

    Before getting to the meat of the movie, I do have to give praise to two of the supporting actors here. Of course, the standout is Judith Anderson(later to be Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. But also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. If you buy the DVD with the "making of" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as "Suspicion", "Shadow Of A Doubt", and "Spellbound". I'll give it ONLY an A, not as A+ that I would give such films as "North By Northwest" and "Vertigo". However, I think it is so much a better film than "Wuthering Heights", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again. Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal. It may be her best film...either that or "Suspicion". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive. The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy shorter performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll. I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife. The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an "8" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!
