    According to the 'action movie cookbook', the recipe is pretty straight-forward. As dictated by "Die Hard" back in 1988, the film must be set in a specific location (skyscraper, naval vessel, airport, etc) and have a lone-wolf hero out-manned and out-gunned by the baddies who have taken said location over. Of course, the professionals will try to save the day but they'll bodge it, leaving it to our hero to save the day in a dramatic and explosive manner before rescuing his loved ones (who are naturally held hostage somehow) and becoming a better person at the end of it. That could probably describe perhaps 75% of all action movies released since then and I'm afraid that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't going to start improvising with the formula. This may be as predictable as a season of Scottish Premier League football but it's entertaining enough without stretching its boundaries or your imagination too far. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, a traumatised fireman now reduced to acting as fire marshal at the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey team. Which is handy when the final game of the Stanley Cup rolls into town along with the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) to watch the game. McCord takes his two kids along (Ross Malinger and Whittni Wright) but trouble isn't far away - a crazed terrorist (Powers Boothe) takes control of the stadium and the executive box when the VP is held hostage along with other dignitaries. It's soon up to McCord to take the fight to the terrorists while outside the stadium, the police effort led by Secret Service agent Hallmark (Dorian Harewood) struggles to get involved... I could go on detailing the plot but I reckon that you can fill in the blanks yourself. "Sudden Death" has little spark of originality or imagination, remaining content to tick off each genre clich&eacute; in order until the inevitable ending. I hasten to add that this is a decent enough action movie - certainly, you know what to expect from JCVD and he doesn't disappoint in the fight scenes. As a hero, though, he remains pretty vacant and is thoroughly outshone by Boothe (when asked what sort of lunatic he is, he replies "The best kind!") who displays more charisma than Van Damme could ever hope to muster. Ignoring the minutiae of the plot which, frankly, is pretty tenuous at best then this is the sort of guys-night-in garbage that you could happily rent and not feel short-changed at. Action veterans, however, might be a little annoyed. For me, the best moment was the fight between Van Damme and a seven-foot-tall cuddly penguin in a kitchen which had more thought put into it than the rest of the film put together. Naturally, they stumble into everything remotely dangerous in a kitchen - meat slicer, deep fat fryer, dishwasher, tenderiser, you name it. But from there, the action seems to come in fits and starts when McCord begins trying to track the bombs planted in the stadium. It may strive for comparisons to "Die Hard" but I'm afraid that "Sudden Death" felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing, much like Steven Seagal's "Under Siege" did. It knows what action fans want and it provides all the fist-pumping, roundhouse-kicking nonsense that they could ask for. But for me, there is a strange lack of quality to it - there are no surprises in store for anyone other than the fact that nobody gets hit with a skate and there isn't even a love interest to provide some much-needed eye candy amid the ricocheting bullets and ill-lit steamy pipe-work (which is bathed in a red light for reasons I cannot possibly fathom other than it makes Van Damme look hard). I also didn't like the ending which felt and looked badly written, executed and just didn't feel right. Van Damme has made better films than this - "Universal Soldier" remains my favourite of his while "Timecop" is also held in high esteem by fans of the Muscles From Brussels. But "Sudden Death" is an adequate enough time-passer but not likely to change the world any time soon. I was always more into American Football anyway...

    When I was in my teenage years, growing up in the nineties I loved a good action flick with Jean Claude Van Damme. He wasn't my favourite hero but he was always good for action. I thought I remembered Sudden Death being one of my favourites so I was anxious to watch it again. I'm glad I did because man was it bad. I was completely entertained but now that I've seen so many more movies and become something of a connoisseur I can see all the ridiculously huge plot holes with a movie like this. I mean any good action film requires you to suspend some belief but I'm talking ridiculous gaping plot holes that are just ignored. How is that terrorists completely overtake a stadium during the biggest sporting event ever, blow up cars outside the stadium, have massive gunfights and perform other acts of terrorism without anyone inside the stadium ever having any idea? Its ludicrous. This is only one example but its a major one. The acting for the most part is wooden and even Van Damme who at least has a strong chemistry on screen just doesn't really come alive in this one. Still with those downsides the film is still fun and entertaining and still has some worthy action scenes. Many will poke fun at Jean-Claude Van Damme for his acting abilities but he was a nineties king for a brief moment. He was a martial arts/action superstar and this seems almost primed for him. The unfortunate part is they misuse him. He hardly does any martial arts and just seems so out of place. His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things. Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, my country's most profitable export product (right behind beer, chocolate and waffles), stars in what is arguably one of the top three best films of his career. I deliberately state top three, because personally I'm also a big fan of "Death Warrant" and "Hard Target" even though I might be the only one. "Sudden Death" is a typical "Die Hard" clone, like there were far too many of them throughout the nineties, but it's one of the chosen few that are actually great fun and closely approaching the quality level of the actual "Die Hard" sequels (not the one and only original, of course). This accomplishment is largely thanks to the craftsmanship of director Peter Hyams and  also typical for major action blockbusters  the presence of a genuinely evil villain you just hate to love. In this particular case it's Powers Booth who depicts his terrorist/robber character continuously straight-faced and seemingly emotionless regardless of who he kills or what challenge overcomes him. Booth and his equally evil platoon of accomplices invade the Vice Presidents' lounge during the prestigious Stanley Cup ice-hockey finale and demand for a whole lot of money to be transferred to secret bank accounts all across the globe. If there aren't sufficient transfers at the end of each game period, Booth kills off one of the hostages. In case the whole sum isn't transferred at the end of the game, he threatens to blow up the entire stadium with everyone in it. Luckily for the thousands of (unaware) spectators, the tough former fireman JCVD is the arena's responsible fire safety inspector and Power Booth made the terrible mistake of taking his young daughter hostage. "Sudden Death" guarantees adrenalin-rushes from start to finish, with violent shootouts as well as brutal hand combat battles, a suspenseful race-against-the-clock aspect, a bit of disaster-movie mayhem near the finale and a handful of cool (if predictable) plot twists. I wouldn't know what to possibly expect more from a 90's action movie.

    Back in his heyday, martial arts sensation Jean Claude Van Damme was fighting titans like Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and Attila. But in this movie, JCVD (playing Darren McCord) is reduced to fighting a hockey team's mascot (which looks like a cross between a hen and a penguin) -- and worst of all he comes very close to losing. And that fight scene really sums up this entire movie. Jean Claude Van Damme was in his element when he was playing unapologetically macho guys in movies that were so cheesy, so laid back, and so consciously silly that they were funny and fun to watch. In addition, some of Van Damme's martial arts fight scenes in those laid back, silly films were brilliant in terms of their execution. But in director Peter Hyams' "Sudden Death," all of that cheesy, laid back, silliness that made the JCVD movies so entertaining was lost in a barrage of loud and remarkably boring shoot em ups, explosions, and stunts. Plus the martial arts fights in this movie are few and far between and nothing compared to the wonderful martial arts sequences in JCVD films like "Bloodsport," "Kickboxer," and even (shockingly enough) "Black Eagle." As for the plot, I will not go into all the details about why this movie is awful because there is simply not enough room in this review for that. Suffice it to say, there are two main problems. To begin with, the lead villain (who is so boring that I honestly forgot his name) explains right in the beginning that he will shoot people if $500 million of U.S. government money is not delivered into his bank account by the end of a (get this) period in a hockey game. Hockey, for those who do not follow the sport, has three periods, which leads one to conclude that the villain wants $1.5 billion in all. This scene, where the lead villain explains his plan, sucks out most of this film's excitement and suspense because predictably enough when the first and second periods of the hockey game end, people die violent deaths in scenes that are identical to each other. If that is not bad enough, this film tacks on a ridiculous plot twist at the end of the third period. Apparently the hockey teams are drawn 4-4 and go into sudden death, which inexplicably influences the lead villain to postpone his original plan to kill everyone in the hockey stadium (which he says he will do if all the money is not delivered by the end of the third period) to the end of "sudden death," giving Van Damme just enough time to save the dumb hockey fans. Maybe I could have excused this flawed plot, if the villains were given interesting things to say and do. But the villains in "Sudden Death" are very dull fellows and not frightening at all. As a result, we are not concerned about their potential victims and we are not entertained by the villains. So my advice is to have fun reading this review, have a few laughs, and be glad that you missed this film.

    Fans attending the NHL Stanley Cup 7th game between Chicago and Pittsburgh certainly get more than they could ever anticipate at any game. They even have our hero Jean C. Van Damme in the game thwarting goals by the opposing team. The violence abounds here with just about everyone either dodging or taking bullets. Powers Boothe shines as the man hell-bent on having funds transferred to various banks under the threat of blowing the stadium apart. He holds the Vice President and others as hostages and shows how ruthless he can really become. Hostages are shot including the mayor's hysterical sobbing wife. Van Damme takes on the Rambo like character with a charismatic force. Naturally, his children are on the scene and he has something to prove as two years before, he was unable to rescue a child in a fire.

    Darren McCord takes his two kids to a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play- off game. Unbeknown to him, the sports arena has been taken over by terrorists, who are holding the Vice President of the United States, as well as many other high-ranking officials hostage. Darren later becomes the only one who is aware of the situation. And, the stakes are raised when the terrorists announce that they will blow-up the building at the end of the game. Therefore, Darren must not only subdue the terrorists, but postpone the game and send it to overtime..... Oh yes, the film is silly, and full of gaping plot holes, but for heavens sake, it's a really fun movie with a really good performance from Van Damme (his relationship with his children is spot on), and Powers Boothe, looking like he's having the time of his life as the villain. It's a shame though that the movie was released at the time it was. The Die Hard in a..... Sub genre had been way over done, and Van Damme was becoming less successful at the box office. As well as being very funny in places, it's also quite sadistic in the fact that the terrorists literally don't care who they kill. Elderly women, Wives, and head cooks, no one is safe. The films edited really well, and the action scenes look good and never get too over the top, despite the fact Van Damme has a fight with a giant penguin. In my opinion it's his best film of the nineties and it never gets boring, thanks to Boothe and a great performance from Van Damme. If you've never seen a Van Damme film and are not I to martial arts movies, this is for you.

    This is an extremely entertaining movie that never lets up. If you like (or love) Stallone or Schwarzenegar, chances are you'll like Van Damme. With either of the aforementioned actors also in the role, the results would have been the same. Of course, it's inevitable in most of these kinds of action pictures that one of the good guys turns out not to be good after all. Why? I have no clue. This character is played by Dorian Harewood, whom you might recognize from the TV series "7th Heaven". This is the way action movies should be: Suspenseful, entertaining, and thought-provoking. ***1/2 out of ****

    Coming towards the back-end of Jean-Claude Van Damme's popularity with movie-goers (although the fans would stick with him), "Sudden Death" would be an huge improvement over his previous feature "Street Fighter" but only to be short-lived with what was to follow in the late-90s. Really he didn't fall away like some other 80s and 90s action stars, but actually made some decent features even if they were straight to video. Anyhow "Sudden Death" would be directed (and photographed) by Peter Hyams, who previously in the year before guided Van Damme in "Timecop". What we get is a fashionably conventional, but tautly exciting siege standoff like something in the sorts of "Die Hard", although done during a sporting spectacle meaning a stadium load of victims (at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena) are virtually unaware of the danger. Van Damme is the only one who can stop these terrorists who are holding the American vice-president for ransom in a private box. These guys mean business. Powers Boothe is terrifically commanding and genuinely threatening. While quite suave and quick with a witty response, he's one you wouldn't want to get on his bad side as there's no hesitations in the way he gets about things. Van Damme's ex-fire-fighter character (who is scared by a past incident) gets involved when his daughter is kidnapped and he goes about trying to spoil the terrorist's party by disabling their bombs while also taking some of them out. The expansive set-up might have been done to death and is elaborately plotted, but Hyams perfectly delivers the martial arts combat of its star (where can you see Van Damme take on the Pittsburgh Penguins' mascot) and the suspense of the situation to go with it. While slow and steady to start, where it feels played down suddenly becomes an assault on the senses with its busy pacing and bruising, brutal and unsparing violence that builds up to a heart stopping finale. "My daddy's a fireman."

    The muscles from Brussels plays Darren McCord, a divorced ex-firefighter who must contend with baddies when they, because the vice-president is taking in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finales, take a hockey arena hostage, that Darren's two kids happen to be at as well. This is one of Van Damme's more enjoyable films and even one of the better numerous Die Hard clones out there. The kids are annoying but that's pretty much the only major gripe I have about this action film. If you're a lover of the genre you'll enjoy this one, if you're a JCVD fan, you'll love it.

    Sudden Death Canadians are so vehement about hockey that no matter if their team wins or loses, they will still riot in the streets. Fortunately, the Canadian firefighter in this action movie is on-hand to extinguish overturned police cruises. Unable to perform his firefighting duties, a disgraced fireman, Darren (Jean Claude Van Damme), takes a fire marshal position with the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. On the same night his children are attending Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, however, so too is a terrorist (Powers Boothe), who has just taken the place hostage. With the arena rigged to go off at the end of the game, Darren must now send the game into overtime before he can defuse the bombs. A forgotten gem from the rogue-hostage genre, Sudden Death's greatness lines in its sublime lunacy. I mean, why would anyone want to blow up a hockey arena if Don Cherry wasn't inside?

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, my country's most profitable export product (right behind beer, chocolate and waffles), stars in what is arguably one of the top three best films of his career. I deliberately state top three, because personally I'm also a big fan of "Death Warrant" and "Hard Target" even though I might be the only one. "Sudden Death" is a typical "Die Hard" clone, like there were far too many of them throughout the nineties, but it's one of the chosen few that are actually great fun and closely approaching the quality level of the actual "Die Hard" sequels (not the one and only original, of course). This accomplishment is largely thanks to the craftsmanship of director Peter Hyams and  also typical for major action blockbusters  the presence of a genuinely evil villain you just hate to love. In this particular case it's Powers Booth who depicts his terrorist/robber character continuously straight-faced and seemingly emotionless regardless of who he kills or what challenge overcomes him. Booth and his equally evil platoon of accomplices invade the Vice Presidents' lounge during the prestigious Stanley Cup ice-hockey finale and demand for a whole lot of money to be transferred to secret bank accounts all across the globe. If there aren't sufficient transfers at the end of each game period, Booth kills off one of the hostages. In case the whole sum isn't transferred at the end of the game, he threatens to blow up the entire stadium with everyone in it. Luckily for the thousands of (unaware) spectators, the tough former fireman JCVD is the arena's responsible fire safety inspector and Power Booth made the terrible mistake of taking his young daughter hostage. "Sudden Death" guarantees adrenalin-rushes from start to finish, with violent shootouts as well as brutal hand combat battles, a suspenseful race-against-the-clock aspect, a bit of disaster-movie mayhem near the finale and a handful of cool (if predictable) plot twists. I wouldn't know what to possibly expect more from a 90's action movie.

    Back in his heyday, martial arts sensation Jean Claude Van Damme was fighting titans like Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and Attila. But in this movie, JCVD (playing Darren McCord) is reduced to fighting a hockey team's mascot (which looks like a cross between a hen and a penguin) -- and worst of all he comes very close to losing. And that fight scene really sums up this entire movie. Jean Claude Van Damme was in his element when he was playing unapologetically macho guys in movies that were so cheesy, so laid back, and so consciously silly that they were funny and fun to watch. In addition, some of Van Damme's martial arts fight scenes in those laid back, silly films were brilliant in terms of their execution. But in director Peter Hyams' "Sudden Death," all of that cheesy, laid back, silliness that made the JCVD movies so entertaining was lost in a barrage of loud and remarkably boring shoot em ups, explosions, and stunts. Plus the martial arts fights in this movie are few and far between and nothing compared to the wonderful martial arts sequences in JCVD films like "Bloodsport," "Kickboxer," and even (shockingly enough) "Black Eagle." As for the plot, I will not go into all the details about why this movie is awful because there is simply not enough room in this review for that. Suffice it to say, there are two main problems. To begin with, the lead villain (who is so boring that I honestly forgot his name) explains right in the beginning that he will shoot people if $500 million of U.S. government money is not delivered into his bank account by the end of a (get this) period in a hockey game. Hockey, for those who do not follow the sport, has three periods, which leads one to conclude that the villain wants $1.5 billion in all. This scene, where the lead villain explains his plan, sucks out most of this film's excitement and suspense because predictably enough when the first and second periods of the hockey game end, people die violent deaths in scenes that are identical to each other. If that is not bad enough, this film tacks on a ridiculous plot twist at the end of the third period. Apparently the hockey teams are drawn 4-4 and go into sudden death, which inexplicably influences the lead villain to postpone his original plan to kill everyone in the hockey stadium (which he says he will do if all the money is not delivered by the end of the third period) to the end of "sudden death," giving Van Damme just enough time to save the dumb hockey fans. Maybe I could have excused this flawed plot, if the villains were given interesting things to say and do. But the villains in "Sudden Death" are very dull fellows and not frightening at all. As a result, we are not concerned about their potential victims and we are not entertained by the villains. So my advice is to have fun reading this review, have a few laughs, and be glad that you missed this film.

    Fans attending the NHL Stanley Cup 7th game between Chicago and Pittsburgh certainly get more than they could ever anticipate at any game. They even have our hero Jean C. Van Damme in the game thwarting goals by the opposing team. The violence abounds here with just about everyone either dodging or taking bullets. Powers Boothe shines as the man hell-bent on having funds transferred to various banks under the threat of blowing the stadium apart. He holds the Vice President and others as hostages and shows how ruthless he can really become. Hostages are shot including the mayor's hysterical sobbing wife. Van Damme takes on the Rambo like character with a charismatic force. Naturally, his children are on the scene and he has something to prove as two years before, he was unable to rescue a child in a fire.

    Darren McCord takes his two kids to a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play- off game. Unbeknown to him, the sports arena has been taken over by terrorists, who are holding the Vice President of the United States, as well as many other high-ranking officials hostage. Darren later becomes the only one who is aware of the situation. And, the stakes are raised when the terrorists announce that they will blow-up the building at the end of the game. Therefore, Darren must not only subdue the terrorists, but postpone the game and send it to overtime..... Oh yes, the film is silly, and full of gaping plot holes, but for heavens sake, it's a really fun movie with a really good performance from Van Damme (his relationship with his children is spot on), and Powers Boothe, looking like he's having the time of his life as the villain. It's a shame though that the movie was released at the time it was. The Die Hard in a..... Sub genre had been way over done, and Van Damme was becoming less successful at the box office. As well as being very funny in places, it's also quite sadistic in the fact that the terrorists literally don't care who they kill. Elderly women, Wives, and head cooks, no one is safe. The films edited really well, and the action scenes look good and never get too over the top, despite the fact Van Damme has a fight with a giant penguin. In my opinion it's his best film of the nineties and it never gets boring, thanks to Boothe and a great performance from Van Damme. If you've never seen a Van Damme film and are not I to martial arts movies, this is for you.

    This is an extremely entertaining movie that never lets up. If you like (or love) Stallone or Schwarzenegar, chances are you'll like Van Damme. With either of the aforementioned actors also in the role, the results would have been the same. Of course, it's inevitable in most of these kinds of action pictures that one of the good guys turns out not to be good after all. Why? I have no clue. This character is played by Dorian Harewood, whom you might recognize from the TV series "7th Heaven". This is the way action movies should be: Suspenseful, entertaining, and thought-provoking. ***1/2 out of ****

    Coming towards the back-end of Jean-Claude Van Damme's popularity with movie-goers (although the fans would stick with him), "Sudden Death" would be an huge improvement over his previous feature "Street Fighter" but only to be short-lived with what was to follow in the late-90s. Really he didn't fall away like some other 80s and 90s action stars, but actually made some decent features even if they were straight to video. Anyhow "Sudden Death" would be directed (and photographed) by Peter Hyams, who previously in the year before guided Van Damme in "Timecop". What we get is a fashionably conventional, but tautly exciting siege standoff like something in the sorts of "Die Hard", although done during a sporting spectacle meaning a stadium load of victims (at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena) are virtually unaware of the danger. Van Damme is the only one who can stop these terrorists who are holding the American vice-president for ransom in a private box. These guys mean business. Powers Boothe is terrifically commanding and genuinely threatening. While quite suave and quick with a witty response, he's one you wouldn't want to get on his bad side as there's no hesitations in the way he gets about things. Van Damme's ex-fire-fighter character (who is scared by a past incident) gets involved when his daughter is kidnapped and he goes about trying to spoil the terrorist's party by disabling their bombs while also taking some of them out. The expansive set-up might have been done to death and is elaborately plotted, but Hyams perfectly delivers the martial arts combat of its star (where can you see Van Damme take on the Pittsburgh Penguins' mascot) and the suspense of the situation to go with it. While slow and steady to start, where it feels played down suddenly becomes an assault on the senses with its busy pacing and bruising, brutal and unsparing violence that builds up to a heart stopping finale. "My daddy's a fireman."

    The muscles from Brussels plays Darren McCord, a divorced ex-firefighter who must contend with baddies when they, because the vice-president is taking in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finales, take a hockey arena hostage, that Darren's two kids happen to be at as well. This is one of Van Damme's more enjoyable films and even one of the better numerous Die Hard clones out there. The kids are annoying but that's pretty much the only major gripe I have about this action film. If you're a lover of the genre you'll enjoy this one, if you're a JCVD fan, you'll love it.

    Sudden Death Canadians are so vehement about hockey that no matter if their team wins or loses, they will still riot in the streets. Fortunately, the Canadian firefighter in this action movie is on-hand to extinguish overturned police cruises. Unable to perform his firefighting duties, a disgraced fireman, Darren (Jean Claude Van Damme), takes a fire marshal position with the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. On the same night his children are attending Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, however, so too is a terrorist (Powers Boothe), who has just taken the place hostage. With the arena rigged to go off at the end of the game, Darren must now send the game into overtime before he can defuse the bombs. A forgotten gem from the rogue-hostage genre, Sudden Death's greatness lines in its sublime lunacy. I mean, why would anyone want to blow up a hockey arena if Don Cherry wasn't inside?

    "Die Hard" on ice but lacking any original ideas whatsoever - 67%

    According to the 'action movie cookbook', the recipe is pretty straight-forward. As dictated by "Die Hard" back in 1988, the film must be set in a specific location (skyscraper, naval vessel, airport, etc) and have a lone-wolf hero out-manned and out-gunned by the baddies who have taken said location over. Of course, the professionals will try to save the day but they'll bodge it, leaving it to our hero to save the day in a dramatic and explosive manner before rescuing his loved ones (who are naturally held hostage somehow) and becoming a better person at the end of it. That could probably describe perhaps 75% of all action movies released since then and I'm afraid that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't going to start improvising with the formula. This may be as predictable as a season of Scottish Premier League football but it's entertaining enough without stretching its boundaries or your imagination too far. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, a traumatised fireman now reduced to acting as fire marshal at the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey team. Which is handy when the final game of the Stanley Cup rolls into town along with the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) to watch the game. McCord takes his two kids along (Ross Malinger and Whittni Wright) but trouble isn't far away - a crazed terrorist (Powers Boothe) takes control of the stadium and the executive box when the VP is held hostage along with other dignitaries. It's soon up to McCord to take the fight to the terrorists while outside the stadium, the police effort led by Secret Service agent Hallmark (Dorian Harewood) struggles to get involved... I could go on detailing the plot but I reckon that you can fill in the blanks yourself. "Sudden Death" has little spark of originality or imagination, remaining content to tick off each genre clich&eacute; in order until the inevitable ending. I hasten to add that this is a decent enough action movie - certainly, you know what to expect from JCVD and he doesn't disappoint in the fight scenes. As a hero, though, he remains pretty vacant and is thoroughly outshone by Boothe (when asked what sort of lunatic he is, he replies "The best kind!") who displays more charisma than Van Damme could ever hope to muster. Ignoring the minutiae of the plot which, frankly, is pretty tenuous at best then this is the sort of guys-night-in garbage that you could happily rent and not feel short-changed at. Action veterans, however, might be a little annoyed. For me, the best moment was the fight between Van Damme and a seven-foot-tall cuddly penguin in a kitchen which had more thought put into it than the rest of the film put together. Naturally, they stumble into everything remotely dangerous in a kitchen - meat slicer, deep fat fryer, dishwasher, tenderiser, you name it. But from there, the action seems to come in fits and starts when McCord begins trying to track the bombs planted in the stadium. It may strive for comparisons to "Die Hard" but I'm afraid that "Sudden Death" felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing, much like Steven Seagal's "Under Siege" did. It knows what action fans want and it provides all the fist-pumping, roundhouse-kicking nonsense that they could ask for. But for me, there is a strange lack of quality to it - there are no surprises in store for anyone other than the fact that nobody gets hit with a skate and there isn't even a love interest to provide some much-needed eye candy amid the ricocheting bullets and ill-lit steamy pipe-work (which is bathed in a red light for reasons I cannot possibly fathom other than it makes Van Damme look hard). I also didn't like the ending which felt and looked badly written, executed and just didn't feel right. Van Damme has made better films than this - "Universal Soldier" remains my favourite of his while "Timecop" is also held in high esteem by fans of the Muscles From Brussels. But "Sudden Death" is an adequate enough time-passer but not likely to change the world any time soon. I was always more into American Football anyway...

    When I was in my teenage years, growing up in the nineties I loved a good action flick with Jean Claude Van Damme. He wasn't my favourite hero but he was always good for action. I thought I remembered Sudden Death being one of my favourites so I was anxious to watch it again. I'm glad I did because man was it bad. I was completely entertained but now that I've seen so many more movies and become something of a connoisseur I can see all the ridiculously huge plot holes with a movie like this. I mean any good action film requires you to suspend some belief but I'm talking ridiculous gaping plot holes that are just ignored. How is that terrorists completely overtake a stadium during the biggest sporting event ever, blow up cars outside the stadium, have massive gunfights and perform other acts of terrorism without anyone inside the stadium ever having any idea? Its ludicrous. This is only one example but its a major one. The acting for the most part is wooden and even Van Damme who at least has a strong chemistry on screen just doesn't really come alive in this one. Still with those downsides the film is still fun and entertaining and still has some worthy action scenes. Many will poke fun at Jean-Claude Van Damme for his acting abilities but he was a nineties king for a brief moment. He was a martial arts/action superstar and this seems almost primed for him. The unfortunate part is they misuse him. He hardly does any martial arts and just seems so out of place. His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things. Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6/10

While quite suave and quick with a witty response, he's one you wouldn't want to get on his bad side as there's no hesitations in the way he gets about things. Van Damme's ex-fire-fighter character (who is scared by a past incident) gets involved when his daughter is kidnapped and he goes about trying to spoil the terrorist's party by disabling their bombs while also taking some of them out. The expansive set-up might have been done to death and is elaborately plotted, but Hyams perfectly delivers the martial arts combat of its star (where can you see Van Damme take on the Pittsburgh Penguins' mascot) and the suspense of the situation to go with it. While slow and steady to start, where it feels played down suddenly becomes an assault on the senses with its busy pacing and bruising, brutal and unsparing violence that builds up to a heart stopping finale. "My daddy's a fireman."

    The muscles from Brussels plays Darren McCord, a divorced ex-firefighter who must contend with baddies when they, because the vice-president is taking in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finales, take a hockey arena hostage, that Darren's two kids happen to be at as well. This is one of Van Damme's more enjoyable films and even one of the better numerous Die Hard clones out there. The kids are annoying but that's pretty much the only major gripe I have about this action film. If you're a lover of the genre you'll enjoy this one, if you're a JCVD fan, you'll love it.

    Sudden Death Canadians are so vehement about hockey that no matter if their team wins or loses, they will still riot in the streets. Fortunately, the Canadian firefighter in this action movie is on-hand to extinguish overturned police cruises. Unable to perform his firefighting duties, a disgraced fireman, Darren (Jean Claude Van Damme), takes a fire marshal position with the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. On the same night his children are attending Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, however, so too is a terrorist (Powers Boothe), who has just taken the place hostage. With the arena rigged to go off at the end of the game, Darren must now send the game into overtime before he can defuse the bombs. A forgotten gem from the rogue-hostage genre, Sudden Death's greatness lines in its sublime lunacy. I mean, why would anyone want to blow up a hockey arena if Don Cherry wasn't inside?

    According to the 'action movie cookbook', the recipe is pretty straight-forward. As dictated by "Die Hard" back in 1988, the film must be set in a specific location (skyscraper, naval vessel, airport, etc) and have a lone-wolf hero out-manned and out-gunned by the baddies who have taken said location over. Of course, the professionals will try to save the day but they'll bodge it, leaving it to our hero to save the day in a dramatic and explosive manner before rescuing his loved ones (who are naturally held hostage somehow) and becoming a better person at the end of it. That could probably describe perhaps 75% of all action movies released since then and I'm afraid that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't going to start improvising with the formula. This may be as predictable as a season of Scottish Premier League football but it's entertaining enough without stretching its boundaries or your imagination too far. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, a traumatised fireman now reduced to acting as fire marshal at the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey team. Which is handy when the final game of the Stanley Cup rolls into town along with the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) to watch the game. McCord takes his two kids along (Ross Malinger and Whittni Wright) but trouble isn't far away - a crazed terrorist (Powers Boothe) takes control of the stadium and the executive box when the VP is held hostage along with other dignitaries. It's soon up to McCord to take the fight to the terrorists while outside the stadium, the police effort led by Secret Service agent Hallmark (Dorian Harewood) struggles to get involved... I could go on detailing the plot but I reckon that you can fill in the blanks yourself. "Sudden Death" has little spark of originality or imagination, remaining content to tick off each genre clich&eacute; in order until the inevitable ending. I hasten to add that this is a decent enough action movie - certainly, you know what to expect from JCVD and he doesn't disappoint in the fight scenes. As a hero, though, he remains pretty vacant and is thoroughly outshone by Boothe (when asked what sort of lunatic he is, he replies "The best kind!") who displays more charisma than Van Damme could ever hope to muster. Ignoring the minutiae of the plot which, frankly, is pretty tenuous at best then this is the sort of guys-night-in garbage that you could happily rent and not feel short-changed at. Action veterans, however, might be a little annoyed. For me, the best moment was the fight between Van Damme and a seven-foot-tall cuddly penguin in a kitchen which had more thought put into it than the rest of the film put together. Naturally, they stumble into everything remotely dangerous in a kitchen - meat slicer, deep fat fryer, dishwasher, tenderiser, you name it. But from there, the action seems to come in fits and starts when McCord begins trying to track the bombs planted in the stadium. It may strive for comparisons to "Die Hard" but I'm afraid that "Sudden Death" felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing, much like Steven Seagal's "Under Siege" did. It knows what action fans want and it provides all the fist-pumping, roundhouse-kicking nonsense that they could ask for. But for me, there is a strange lack of quality to it - there are no surprises in store for anyone other than the fact that nobody gets hit with a skate and there isn't even a love interest to provide some much-needed eye candy amid the ricocheting bullets and ill-lit steamy pipe-work (which is bathed in a red light for reasons I cannot possibly fathom other than it makes Van Damme look hard). I also didn't like the ending which felt and looked badly written, executed and just didn't feel right. Van Damme has made better films than this - "Universal Soldier" remains my favourite of his while "Timecop" is also held in high esteem by fans of the Muscles From Brussels. But "Sudden Death" is an adequate enough time-passer but not likely to change the world any time soon. I was always more into American Football anyway...

    When I was in my teenage years, growing up in the nineties I loved a good action flick with Jean Claude Van Damme. He wasn't my favourite hero but he was always good for action. I thought I remembered Sudden Death being one of my favourites so I was anxious to watch it again. I'm glad I did because man was it bad. I was completely entertained but now that I've seen so many more movies and become something of a connoisseur I can see all the ridiculously huge plot holes with a movie like this. I mean any good action film requires you to suspend some belief but I'm talking ridiculous gaping plot holes that are just ignored. How is that terrorists completely overtake a stadium during the biggest sporting event ever, blow up cars outside the stadium, have massive gunfights and perform other acts of terrorism without anyone inside the stadium ever having any idea? Its ludicrous. This is only one example but its a major one. The acting for the most part is wooden and even Van Damme who at least has a strong chemistry on screen just doesn't really come alive in this one. Still with those downsides the film is still fun and entertaining and still has some worthy action scenes. Many will poke fun at Jean-Claude Van Damme for his acting abilities but he was a nineties king for a brief moment. He was a martial arts/action superstar and this seems almost primed for him. The unfortunate part is they misuse him. He hardly does any martial arts and just seems so out of place. His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things. Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, my country's most profitable export product (right behind beer, chocolate and waffles), stars in what is arguably one of the top three best films of his career. I deliberately state top three, because personally I'm also a big fan of "Death Warrant" and "Hard Target" even though I might be the only one. "Sudden Death" is a typical "Die Hard" clone, like there were far too many of them throughout the nineties, but it's one of the chosen few that are actually great fun and closely approaching the quality level of the actual "Die Hard" sequels (not the one and only original, of course). This accomplishment is largely thanks to the craftsmanship of director Peter Hyams and  also typical for major action blockbusters  the presence of a genuinely evil villain you just hate to love. In this particular case it's Powers Booth who depicts his terrorist/robber character continuously straight-faced and seemingly emotionless regardless of who he kills or what challenge overcomes him. Booth and his equally evil platoon of accomplices invade the Vice Presidents' lounge during the prestigious Stanley Cup ice-hockey finale and demand for a whole lot of money to be transferred to secret bank accounts all across the globe. If there aren't sufficient transfers at the end of each game period, Booth kills off one of the hostages. In case the whole sum isn't transferred at the end of the game, he threatens to blow up the entire stadium with everyone in it. Luckily for the thousands of (unaware) spectators, the tough former fireman JCVD is the arena's responsible fire safety inspector and Power Booth made the terrible mistake of taking his young daughter hostage. "Sudden Death" guarantees adrenalin-rushes from start to finish, with violent shootouts as well as brutal hand combat battles, a suspenseful race-against-the-clock aspect, a bit of disaster-movie mayhem near the finale and a handful of cool (if predictable) plot twists. I wouldn't know what to possibly expect more from a 90's action movie.

    Back in his heyday, martial arts sensation Jean Claude Van Damme was fighting titans like Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and Attila. But in this movie, JCVD (playing Darren McCord) is reduced to fighting a hockey team's mascot (which looks like a cross between a hen and a penguin) -- and worst of all he comes very close to losing. And that fight scene really sums up this entire movie. Jean Claude Van Damme was in his element when he was playing unapologetically macho guys in movies that were so cheesy, so laid back, and so consciously silly that they were funny and fun to watch. In addition, some of Van Damme's martial arts fight scenes in those laid back, silly films were brilliant in terms of their execution. But in director Peter Hyams' "Sudden Death," all of that cheesy, laid back, silliness that made the JCVD movies so entertaining was lost in a barrage of loud and remarkably boring shoot em ups, explosions, and stunts. Plus the martial arts fights in this movie are few and far between and nothing compared to the wonderful martial arts sequences in JCVD films like "Bloodsport," "Kickboxer," and even (shockingly enough) "Black Eagle." As for the plot, I will not go into all the details about why this movie is awful because there is simply not enough room in this review for that. Suffice it to say, there are two main problems. To begin with, the lead villain (who is so boring that I honestly forgot his name) explains right in the beginning that he will shoot people if $500 million of U.S. government money is not delivered into his bank account by the end of a (get this) period in a hockey game. Hockey, for those who do not follow the sport, has three periods, which leads one to conclude that the villain wants $1.5 billion in all. This scene, where the lead villain explains his plan, sucks out most of this film's excitement and suspense because predictably enough when the first and second periods of the hockey game end, people die violent deaths in scenes that are identical to each other. If that is not bad enough, this film tacks on a ridiculous plot twist at the end of the third period. Apparently the hockey teams are drawn 4-4 and go into sudden death, which inexplicably influences the lead villain to postpone his original plan to kill everyone in the hockey stadium (which he says he will do if all the money is not delivered by the end of the third period) to the end of "sudden death," giving Van Damme just enough time to save the dumb hockey fans. Maybe I could have excused this flawed plot, if the villains were given interesting things to say and do. But the villains in "Sudden Death" are very dull fellows and not frightening at all. As a result, we are not concerned about their potential victims and we are not entertained by the villains. So my advice is to have fun reading this review, have a few laughs, and be glad that you missed this film.

    Fans attending the NHL Stanley Cup 7th game between Chicago and Pittsburgh certainly get more than they could ever anticipate at any game. They even have our hero Jean C. Van Damme in the game thwarting goals by the opposing team. The violence abounds here with just about everyone either dodging or taking bullets. Powers Boothe shines as the man hell-bent on having funds transferred to various banks under the threat of blowing the stadium apart. He holds the Vice President and others as hostages and shows how ruthless he can really become. Hostages are shot including the mayor's hysterical sobbing wife. Van Damme takes on the Rambo like character with a charismatic force. Naturally, his children are on the scene and he has something to prove as two years before, he was unable to rescue a child in a fire.

    Darren McCord takes his two kids to a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play- off game. Unbeknown to him, the sports arena has been taken over by terrorists, who are holding the Vice President of the United States, as well as many other high-ranking officials hostage. Darren later becomes the only one who is aware of the situation. And, the stakes are raised when the terrorists announce that they will blow-up the building at the end of the game. Therefore, Darren must not only subdue the terrorists, but postpone the game and send it to overtime..... Oh yes, the film is silly, and full of gaping plot holes, but for heavens sake, it's a really fun movie with a really good performance from Van Damme (his relationship with his children is spot on), and Powers Boothe, looking like he's having the time of his life as the villain. It's a shame though that the movie was released at the time it was. The Die Hard in a..... Sub genre had been way over done, and Van Damme was becoming less successful at the box office. As well as being very funny in places, it's also quite sadistic in the fact that the terrorists literally don't care who they kill. Elderly women, Wives, and head cooks, no one is safe. The films edited really well, and the action scenes look good and never get too over the top, despite the fact Van Damme has a fight with a giant penguin. In my opinion it's his best film of the nineties and it never gets boring, thanks to Boothe and a great performance from Van Damme. If you've never seen a Van Damme film and are not I to martial arts movies, this is for you.

    This is an extremely entertaining movie that never lets up. If you like (or love) Stallone or Schwarzenegar, chances are you'll like Van Damme. With either of the aforementioned actors also in the role, the results would have been the same. Of course, it's inevitable in most of these kinds of action pictures that one of the good guys turns out not to be good after all. Why? I have no clue. This character is played by Dorian Harewood, whom you might recognize from the TV series "7th Heaven". This is the way action movies should be: Suspenseful, entertaining, and thought-provoking. ***1/2 out of ****

    Coming towards the back-end of Jean-Claude Van Damme's popularity with movie-goers (although the fans would stick with him), "Sudden Death" would be an huge improvement over his previous feature "Street Fighter" but only to be short-lived with what was to follow in the late-90s. Really he didn't fall away like some other 80s and 90s action stars, but actually made some decent features even if they were straight to video. Anyhow "Sudden Death" would be directed (and photographed) by Peter Hyams, who previously in the year before guided Van Damme in "Timecop". What we get is a fashionably conventional, but tautly exciting siege standoff like something in the sorts of "Die Hard", although done during a sporting spectacle meaning a stadium load of victims (at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena) are virtually unaware of the danger. Van Damme is the only one who can stop these terrorists who are holding the American vice-president for ransom in a private box. These guys mean business. Powers Boothe is terrifically commanding and genuinely threatening. While quite suave and quick with a witty response, he's one you wouldn't want to get on his bad side as there's no hesitations in the way he gets about things. Van Damme's ex-fire-fighter character (who is scared by a past incident) gets involved when his daughter is kidnapped and he goes about trying to spoil the terrorist's party by disabling their bombs while also taking some of them out. The expansive set-up might have been done to death and is elaborately plotted, but Hyams perfectly delivers the martial arts combat of its star (where can you see Van Damme take on the Pittsburgh Penguins' mascot) and the suspense of the situation to go with it. While slow and steady to start, where it feels played down suddenly becomes an assault on the senses with its busy pacing and bruising, brutal and unsparing violence that builds up to a heart stopping finale. "My daddy's a fireman."

As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, my country's most profitable export product (right behind beer, chocolate and waffles), stars in what is arguably one of the top three best films of his career. I deliberately state top three, because personally I'm also a big fan of "Death Warrant" and "Hard Target" even though I might be the only one. "Sudden Death" is a typical "Die Hard" clone, like there were far too many of them throughout the nineties, but it's one of the chosen few that are actually great fun and closely approaching the quality level of the actual "Die Hard" sequels (not the one and only original, of course). This accomplishment is largely thanks to the craftsmanship of director Peter Hyams and  also typical for major action blockbusters  the presence of a genuinely evil villain you just hate to love. In this particular case it's Powers Booth who depicts his terrorist/robber character continuously straight-faced and seemingly emotionless regardless of who he kills or what challenge overcomes him. Booth and his equally evil platoon of accomplices invade the Vice Presidents' lounge during the prestigious Stanley Cup ice-hockey finale and demand for a whole lot of money to be transferred to secret bank accounts all across the globe. If there aren't sufficient transfers at the end of each game period, Booth kills off one of the hostages. In case the whole sum isn't transferred at the end of the game, he threatens to blow up the entire stadium with everyone in it. Luckily for the thousands of (unaware) spectators, the tough former fireman JCVD is the arena's responsible fire safety inspector and Power Booth made the terrible mistake of taking his young daughter hostage. "Sudden Death" guarantees adrenalin-rushes from start to finish, with violent shootouts as well as brutal hand combat battles, a suspenseful race-against-the-clock aspect, a bit of disaster-movie mayhem near the finale and a handful of cool (if predictable) plot twists. I wouldn't know what to possibly expect more from a 90's action movie.

    Back in his heyday, martial arts sensation Jean Claude Van Damme was fighting titans like Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and Attila. But in this movie, JCVD (playing Darren McCord) is reduced to fighting a hockey team's mascot (which looks like a cross between a hen and a penguin) -- and worst of all he comes very close to losing. And that fight scene really sums up this entire movie. Jean Claude Van Damme was in his element when he was playing unapologetically macho guys in movies that were so cheesy, so laid back, and so consciously silly that they were funny and fun to watch. In addition, some of Van Damme's martial arts fight scenes in those laid back, silly films were brilliant in terms of their execution. But in director Peter Hyams' "Sudden Death," all of that cheesy, laid back, silliness that made the JCVD movies so entertaining was lost in a barrage of loud and remarkably boring shoot em ups, explosions, and stunts. Plus the martial arts fights in this movie are few and far between and nothing compared to the wonderful martial arts sequences in JCVD films like "Bloodsport," "Kickboxer," and even (shockingly enough) "Black Eagle." As for the plot, I will not go into all the details about why this movie is awful because there is simply not enough room in this review for that. Suffice it to say, there are two main problems. To begin with, the lead villain (who is so boring that I honestly forgot his name) explains right in the beginning that he will shoot people if $500 million of U.S. government money is not delivered into his bank account by the end of a (get this) period in a hockey game. Hockey, for those who do not follow the sport, has three periods, which leads one to conclude that the villain wants $1.5 billion in all. This scene, where the lead villain explains his plan, sucks out most of this film's excitement and suspense because predictably enough when the first and second periods of the hockey game end, people die violent deaths in scenes that are identical to each other. If that is not bad enough, this film tacks on a ridiculous plot twist at the end of the third period. Apparently the hockey teams are drawn 4-4 and go into sudden death, which inexplicably influences the lead villain to postpone his original plan to kill everyone in the hockey stadium (which he says he will do if all the money is not delivered by the end of the third period) to the end of "sudden death," giving Van Damme just enough time to save the dumb hockey fans. Maybe I could have excused this flawed plot, if the villains were given interesting things to say and do. But the villains in "Sudden Death" are very dull fellows and not frightening at all. As a result, we are not concerned about their potential victims and we are not entertained by the villains. So my advice is to have fun reading this review, have a few laughs, and be glad that you missed this film.

    Fans attending the NHL Stanley Cup 7th game between Chicago and Pittsburgh certainly get more than they could ever anticipate at any game. They even have our hero Jean C. Van Damme in the game thwarting goals by the opposing team. The violence abounds here with just about everyone either dodging or taking bullets. Powers Boothe shines as the man hell-bent on having funds transferred to various banks under the threat of blowing the stadium apart. He holds the Vice President and others as hostages and shows how ruthless he can really become. Hostages are shot including the mayor's hysterical sobbing wife. Van Damme takes on the Rambo like character with a charismatic force. Naturally, his children are on the scene and he has something to prove as two years before, he was unable to rescue a child in a fire.

    Darren McCord takes his two kids to a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play- off game. Unbeknown to him, the sports arena has been taken over by terrorists, who are holding the Vice President of the United States, as well as many other high-ranking officials hostage. Darren later becomes the only one who is aware of the situation. And, the stakes are raised when the terrorists announce that they will blow-up the building at the end of the game. Therefore, Darren must not only subdue the terrorists, but postpone the game and send it to overtime..... Oh yes, the film is silly, and full of gaping plot holes, but for heavens sake, it's a really fun movie with a really good performance from Van Damme (his relationship with his children is spot on), and Powers Boothe, looking like he's having the time of his life as the villain. It's a shame though that the movie was released at the time it was. The Die Hard in a..... Sub genre had been way over done, and Van Damme was becoming less successful at the box office. As well as being very funny in places, it's also quite sadistic in the fact that the terrorists literally don't care who they kill. Elderly women, Wives, and head cooks, no one is safe. The films edited really well, and the action scenes look good and never get too over the top, despite the fact Van Damme has a fight with a giant penguin. In my opinion it's his best film of the nineties and it never gets boring, thanks to Boothe and a great performance from Van Damme. If you've never seen a Van Damme film and are not I to martial arts movies, this is for you.

    This is an extremely entertaining movie that never lets up. If you like (or love) Stallone or Schwarzenegar, chances are you'll like Van Damme. With either of the aforementioned actors also in the role, the results would have been the same. Of course, it's inevitable in most of these kinds of action pictures that one of the good guys turns out not to be good after all. Why? I have no clue. This character is played by Dorian Harewood, whom you might recognize from the TV series "7th Heaven". This is the way action movies should be: Suspenseful, entertaining, and thought-provoking. ***1/2 out of ****

    Coming towards the back-end of Jean-Claude Van Damme's popularity with movie-goers (although the fans would stick with him), "Sudden Death" would be an huge improvement over his previous feature "Street Fighter" but only to be short-lived with what was to follow in the late-90s. Really he didn't fall away like some other 80s and 90s action stars, but actually made some decent features even if they were straight to video. Anyhow "Sudden Death" would be directed (and photographed) by Peter Hyams, who previously in the year before guided Van Damme in "Timecop". What we get is a fashionably conventional, but tautly exciting siege standoff like something in the sorts of "Die Hard", although done during a sporting spectacle meaning a stadium load of victims (at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena) are virtually unaware of the danger. Van Damme is the only one who can stop these terrorists who are holding the American vice-president for ransom in a private box. These guys mean business. Powers Boothe is terrifically commanding and genuinely threatening. While quite suave and quick with a witty response, he's one you wouldn't want to get on his bad side as there's no hesitations in the way he gets about things. Van Damme's ex-fire-fighter character (who is scared by a past incident) gets involved when his daughter is kidnapped and he goes about trying to spoil the terrorist's party by disabling their bombs while also taking some of them out. The expansive set-up might have been done to death and is elaborately plotted, but Hyams perfectly delivers the martial arts combat of its star (where can you see Van Damme take on the Pittsburgh Penguins' mascot) and the suspense of the situation to go with it. While slow and steady to start, where it feels played down suddenly becomes an assault on the senses with its busy pacing and bruising, brutal and unsparing violence that builds up to a heart stopping finale. "My daddy's a fireman."

    The muscles from Brussels plays Darren McCord, a divorced ex-firefighter who must contend with baddies when they, because the vice-president is taking in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finales, take a hockey arena hostage, that Darren's two kids happen to be at as well. This is one of Van Damme's more enjoyable films and even one of the better numerous Die Hard clones out there. The kids are annoying but that's pretty much the only major gripe I have about this action film. If you're a lover of the genre you'll enjoy this one, if you're a JCVD fan, you'll love it.

    Sudden Death Canadians are so vehement about hockey that no matter if their team wins or loses, they will still riot in the streets. Fortunately, the Canadian firefighter in this action movie is on-hand to extinguish overturned police cruises. Unable to perform his firefighting duties, a disgraced fireman, Darren (Jean Claude Van Damme), takes a fire marshal position with the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. On the same night his children are attending Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, however, so too is a terrorist (Powers Boothe), who has just taken the place hostage. With the arena rigged to go off at the end of the game, Darren must now send the game into overtime before he can defuse the bombs. A forgotten gem from the rogue-hostage genre, Sudden Death's greatness lines in its sublime lunacy. I mean, why would anyone want to blow up a hockey arena if Don Cherry wasn't inside?

    According to the 'action movie cookbook', the recipe is pretty straight-forward. As dictated by "Die Hard" back in 1988, the film must be set in a specific location (skyscraper, naval vessel, airport, etc) and have a lone-wolf hero out-manned and out-gunned by the baddies who have taken said location over. Of course, the professionals will try to save the day but they'll bodge it, leaving it to our hero to save the day in a dramatic and explosive manner before rescuing his loved ones (who are naturally held hostage somehow) and becoming a better person at the end of it. That could probably describe perhaps 75% of all action movies released since then and I'm afraid that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't going to start improvising with the formula. This may be as predictable as a season of Scottish Premier League football but it's entertaining enough without stretching its boundaries or your imagination too far. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, a traumatised fireman now reduced to acting as fire marshal at the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey team. Which is handy when the final game of the Stanley Cup rolls into town along with the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) to watch the game. McCord takes his two kids along (Ross Malinger and Whittni Wright) but trouble isn't far away - a crazed terrorist (Powers Boothe) takes control of the stadium and the executive box when the VP is held hostage along with other dignitaries. It's soon up to McCord to take the fight to the terrorists while outside the stadium, the police effort led by Secret Service agent Hallmark (Dorian Harewood) struggles to get involved... I could go on detailing the plot but I reckon that you can fill in the blanks yourself. "Sudden Death" has little spark of originality or imagination, remaining content to tick off each genre clich&eacute; in order until the inevitable ending. I hasten to add that this is a decent enough action movie - certainly, you know what to expect from JCVD and he doesn't disappoint in the fight scenes. As a hero, though, he remains pretty vacant and is thoroughly outshone by Boothe (when asked what sort of lunatic he is, he replies "The best kind!") who displays more charisma than Van Damme could ever hope to muster. Ignoring the minutiae of the plot which, frankly, is pretty tenuous at best then this is the sort of guys-night-in garbage that you could happily rent and not feel short-changed at. Action veterans, however, might be a little annoyed. For me, the best moment was the fight between Van Damme and a seven-foot-tall cuddly penguin in a kitchen which had more thought put into it than the rest of the film put together. Naturally, they stumble into everything remotely dangerous in a kitchen - meat slicer, deep fat fryer, dishwasher, tenderiser, you name it. But from there, the action seems to come in fits and starts when McCord begins trying to track the bombs planted in the stadium. It may strive for comparisons to "Die Hard" but I'm afraid that "Sudden Death" felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing, much like Steven Seagal's "Under Siege" did. It knows what action fans want and it provides all the fist-pumping, roundhouse-kicking nonsense that they could ask for. But for me, there is a strange lack of quality to it - there are no surprises in store for anyone other than the fact that nobody gets hit with a skate and there isn't even a love interest to provide some much-needed eye candy amid the ricocheting bullets and ill-lit steamy pipe-work (which is bathed in a red light for reasons I cannot possibly fathom other than it makes Van Damme look hard). I also didn't like the ending which felt and looked badly written, executed and just didn't feel right. Van Damme has made better films than this - "Universal Soldier" remains my favourite of his while "Timecop" is also held in high esteem by fans of the Muscles From Brussels. But "Sudden Death" is an adequate enough time-passer but not likely to change the world any time soon. I was always more into American Football anyway...

    When I was in my teenage years, growing up in the nineties I loved a good action flick with Jean Claude Van Damme. He wasn't my favourite hero but he was always good for action. I thought I remembered Sudden Death being one of my favourites so I was anxious to watch it again. I'm glad I did because man was it bad. I was completely entertained but now that I've seen so many more movies and become something of a connoisseur I can see all the ridiculously huge plot holes with a movie like this. I mean any good action film requires you to suspend some belief but I'm talking ridiculous gaping plot holes that are just ignored. How is that terrorists completely overtake a stadium during the biggest sporting event ever, blow up cars outside the stadium, have massive gunfights and perform other acts of terrorism without anyone inside the stadium ever having any idea? Its ludicrous. This is only one example but its a major one. The acting for the most part is wooden and even Van Damme who at least has a strong chemistry on screen just doesn't really come alive in this one. Still with those downsides the film is still fun and entertaining and still has some worthy action scenes. Many will poke fun at Jean-Claude Van Damme for his acting abilities but he was a nineties king for a brief moment. He was a martial arts/action superstar and this seems almost primed for him. The unfortunate part is they misuse him. He hardly does any martial arts and just seems so out of place. His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things. Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6/10

    Coming towards the back-end of Jean-Claude Van Damme's popularity with movie-goers (although the fans would stick with him), "Sudden Death" would be an huge improvement over his previous feature "Street Fighter" but only to be short-lived with what was to follow in the late-90s. Really he didn't fall away like some other 80s and 90s action stars, but actually made some decent features even if they were straight to video. Anyhow "Sudden Death" would be directed (and photographed) by Peter Hyams, who previously in the year before guided Van Damme in "Timecop". What we get is a fashionably conventional, but tautly exciting siege standoff like something in the sorts of "Die Hard", although done during a sporting spectacle meaning a stadium load of victims (at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena) are virtually unaware of the danger. Van Damme is the only one who can stop these terrorists who are holding the American vice-president for ransom in a private box. These guys mean business. Powers Boothe is terrifically commanding and genuinely threatening. While quite suave and quick with a witty response, he's one you wouldn't want to get on his bad side as there's no hesitations in the way he gets about things. Van Damme's ex-fire-fighter character (who is scared by a past incident) gets involved when his daughter is kidnapped and he goes about trying to spoil the terrorist's party by disabling their bombs while also taking some of them out. The expansive set-up might have been done to death and is elaborately plotted, but Hyams perfectly delivers the martial arts combat of its star (where can you see Van Damme take on the Pittsburgh Penguins' mascot) and the suspense of the situation to go with it. While slow and steady to start, where it feels played down suddenly becomes an assault on the senses with its busy pacing and bruising, brutal and unsparing violence that builds up to a heart stopping finale. "My daddy's a fireman."

    The muscles from Brussels plays Darren McCord, a divorced ex-firefighter who must contend with baddies when they, because the vice-president is taking in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finales, take a hockey arena hostage, that Darren's two kids happen to be at as well. This is one of Van Damme's more enjoyable films and even one of the better numerous Die Hard clones out there. The kids are annoying but that's pretty much the only major gripe I have about this action film. If you're a lover of the genre you'll enjoy this one, if you're a JCVD fan, you'll love it.

    Sudden Death Canadians are so vehement about hockey that no matter if their team wins or loses, they will still riot in the streets. Fortunately, the Canadian firefighter in this action movie is on-hand to extinguish overturned police cruises. Unable to perform his firefighting duties, a disgraced fireman, Darren (Jean Claude Van Damme), takes a fire marshal position with the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. On the same night his children are attending Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, however, so too is a terrorist (Powers Boothe), who has just taken the place hostage. With the arena rigged to go off at the end of the game, Darren must now send the game into overtime before he can defuse the bombs. A forgotten gem from the rogue-hostage genre, Sudden Death's greatness lines in its sublime lunacy. I mean, why would anyone want to blow up a hockey arena if Don Cherry wasn't inside?

    According to the 'action movie cookbook', the recipe is pretty straight-forward. As dictated by "Die Hard" back in 1988, the film must be set in a specific location (skyscraper, naval vessel, airport, etc) and have a lone-wolf hero out-manned and out-gunned by the baddies who have taken said location over. Of course, the professionals will try to save the day but they'll bodge it, leaving it to our hero to save the day in a dramatic and explosive manner before rescuing his loved ones (who are naturally held hostage somehow) and becoming a better person at the end of it. That could probably describe perhaps 75% of all action movies released since then and I'm afraid that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't going to start improvising with the formula. This may be as predictable as a season of Scottish Premier League football but it's entertaining enough without stretching its boundaries or your imagination too far. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, a traumatised fireman now reduced to acting as fire marshal at the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey team. Which is handy when the final game of the Stanley Cup rolls into town along with the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) to watch the game. McCord takes his two kids along (Ross Malinger and Whittni Wright) but trouble isn't far away - a crazed terrorist (Powers Boothe) takes control of the stadium and the executive box when the VP is held hostage along with other dignitaries. It's soon up to McCord to take the fight to the terrorists while outside the stadium, the police effort led by Secret Service agent Hallmark (Dorian Harewood) struggles to get involved... I could go on detailing the plot but I reckon that you can fill in the blanks yourself. "Sudden Death" has little spark of originality or imagination, remaining content to tick off each genre clich&eacute; in order until the inevitable ending. I hasten to add that this is a decent enough action movie - certainly, you know what to expect from JCVD and he doesn't disappoint in the fight scenes. As a hero, though, he remains pretty vacant and is thoroughly outshone by Boothe (when asked what sort of lunatic he is, he replies "The best kind!") who displays more charisma than Van Damme could ever hope to muster. Ignoring the minutiae of the plot which, frankly, is pretty tenuous at best then this is the sort of guys-night-in garbage that you could happily rent and not feel short-changed at. Action veterans, however, might be a little annoyed. For me, the best moment was the fight between Van Damme and a seven-foot-tall cuddly penguin in a kitchen which had more thought put into it than the rest of the film put together. Naturally, they stumble into everything remotely dangerous in a kitchen - meat slicer, deep fat fryer, dishwasher, tenderiser, you name it. But from there, the action seems to come in fits and starts when McCord begins trying to track the bombs planted in the stadium. It may strive for comparisons to "Die Hard" but I'm afraid that "Sudden Death" felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing, much like Steven Seagal's "Under Siege" did. It knows what action fans want and it provides all the fist-pumping, roundhouse-kicking nonsense that they could ask for. But for me, there is a strange lack of quality to it - there are no surprises in store for anyone other than the fact that nobody gets hit with a skate and there isn't even a love interest to provide some much-needed eye candy amid the ricocheting bullets and ill-lit steamy pipe-work (which is bathed in a red light for reasons I cannot possibly fathom other than it makes Van Damme look hard). I also didn't like the ending which felt and looked badly written, executed and just didn't feel right. Van Damme has made better films than this - "Universal Soldier" remains my favourite of his while "Timecop" is also held in high esteem by fans of the Muscles From Brussels. But "Sudden Death" is an adequate enough time-passer but not likely to change the world any time soon. I was always more into American Football anyway...

    When I was in my teenage years, growing up in the nineties I loved a good action flick with Jean Claude Van Damme. He wasn't my favourite hero but he was always good for action. I thought I remembered Sudden Death being one of my favourites so I was anxious to watch it again. I'm glad I did because man was it bad. I was completely entertained but now that I've seen so many more movies and become something of a connoisseur I can see all the ridiculously huge plot holes with a movie like this. I mean any good action film requires you to suspend some belief but I'm talking ridiculous gaping plot holes that are just ignored. How is that terrorists completely overtake a stadium during the biggest sporting event ever, blow up cars outside the stadium, have massive gunfights and perform other acts of terrorism without anyone inside the stadium ever having any idea? Its ludicrous. This is only one example but its a major one. The acting for the most part is wooden and even Van Damme who at least has a strong chemistry on screen just doesn't really come alive in this one. Still with those downsides the film is still fun and entertaining and still has some worthy action scenes. Many will poke fun at Jean-Claude Van Damme for his acting abilities but he was a nineties king for a brief moment. He was a martial arts/action superstar and this seems almost primed for him. The unfortunate part is they misuse him. He hardly does any martial arts and just seems so out of place. His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things. Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, my country's most profitable export product (right behind beer, chocolate and waffles), stars in what is arguably one of the top three best films of his career. I deliberately state top three, because personally I'm also a big fan of "Death Warrant" and "Hard Target" even though I might be the only one. "Sudden Death" is a typical "Die Hard" clone, like there were far too many of them throughout the nineties, but it's one of the chosen few that are actually great fun and closely approaching the quality level of the actual "Die Hard" sequels (not the one and only original, of course). This accomplishment is largely thanks to the craftsmanship of director Peter Hyams and  also typical for major action blockbusters  the presence of a genuinely evil villain you just hate to love. In this particular case it's Powers Booth who depicts his terrorist/robber character continuously straight-faced and seemingly emotionless regardless of who he kills or what challenge overcomes him. Booth and his equally evil platoon of accomplices invade the Vice Presidents' lounge during the prestigious Stanley Cup ice-hockey finale and demand for a whole lot of money to be transferred to secret bank accounts all across the globe. If there aren't sufficient transfers at the end of each game period, Booth kills off one of the hostages. In case the whole sum isn't transferred at the end of the game, he threatens to blow up the entire stadium with everyone in it. Luckily for the thousands of (unaware) spectators, the tough former fireman JCVD is the arena's responsible fire safety inspector and Power Booth made the terrible mistake of taking his young daughter hostage. "Sudden Death" guarantees adrenalin-rushes from start to finish, with violent shootouts as well as brutal hand combat battles, a suspenseful race-against-the-clock aspect, a bit of disaster-movie mayhem near the finale and a handful of cool (if predictable) plot twists. I wouldn't know what to possibly expect more from a 90's action movie.

    Back in his heyday, martial arts sensation Jean Claude Van Damme was fighting titans like Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and Attila. But in this movie, JCVD (playing Darren McCord) is reduced to fighting a hockey team's mascot (which looks like a cross between a hen and a penguin) -- and worst of all he comes very close to losing. And that fight scene really sums up this entire movie. Jean Claude Van Damme was in his element when he was playing unapologetically macho guys in movies that were so cheesy, so laid back, and so consciously silly that they were funny and fun to watch. In addition, some of Van Damme's martial arts fight scenes in those laid back, silly films were brilliant in terms of their execution. But in director Peter Hyams' "Sudden Death," all of that cheesy, laid back, silliness that made the JCVD movies so entertaining was lost in a barrage of loud and remarkably boring shoot em ups, explosions, and stunts. Plus the martial arts fights in this movie are few and far between and nothing compared to the wonderful martial arts sequences in JCVD films like "Bloodsport," "Kickboxer," and even (shockingly enough) "Black Eagle." As for the plot, I will not go into all the details about why this movie is awful because there is simply not enough room in this review for that. Suffice it to say, there are two main problems. To begin with, the lead villain (who is so boring that I honestly forgot his name) explains right in the beginning that he will shoot people if $500 million of U.S. government money is not delivered into his bank account by the end of a (get this) period in a hockey game. Hockey, for those who do not follow the sport, has three periods, which leads one to conclude that the villain wants $1.5 billion in all. This scene, where the lead villain explains his plan, sucks out most of this film's excitement and suspense because predictably enough when the first and second periods of the hockey game end, people die violent deaths in scenes that are identical to each other. If that is not bad enough, this film tacks on a ridiculous plot twist at the end of the third period. Apparently the hockey teams are drawn 4-4 and go into sudden death, which inexplicably influences the lead villain to postpone his original plan to kill everyone in the hockey stadium (which he says he will do if all the money is not delivered by the end of the third period) to the end of "sudden death," giving Van Damme just enough time to save the dumb hockey fans. Maybe I could have excused this flawed plot, if the villains were given interesting things to say and do. But the villains in "Sudden Death" are very dull fellows and not frightening at all. As a result, we are not concerned about their potential victims and we are not entertained by the villains. So my advice is to have fun reading this review, have a few laughs, and be glad that you missed this film.

    Fans attending the NHL Stanley Cup 7th game between Chicago and Pittsburgh certainly get more than they could ever anticipate at any game. They even have our hero Jean C. Van Damme in the game thwarting goals by the opposing team. The violence abounds here with just about everyone either dodging or taking bullets. Powers Boothe shines as the man hell-bent on having funds transferred to various banks under the threat of blowing the stadium apart. He holds the Vice President and others as hostages and shows how ruthless he can really become. Hostages are shot including the mayor's hysterical sobbing wife. Van Damme takes on the Rambo like character with a charismatic force. Naturally, his children are on the scene and he has something to prove as two years before, he was unable to rescue a child in a fire.

    Darren McCord takes his two kids to a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play- off game. Unbeknown to him, the sports arena has been taken over by terrorists, who are holding the Vice President of the United States, as well as many other high-ranking officials hostage. Darren later becomes the only one who is aware of the situation. And, the stakes are raised when the terrorists announce that they will blow-up the building at the end of the game. Therefore, Darren must not only subdue the terrorists, but postpone the game and send it to overtime..... Oh yes, the film is silly, and full of gaping plot holes, but for heavens sake, it's a really fun movie with a really good performance from Van Damme (his relationship with his children is spot on), and Powers Boothe, looking like he's having the time of his life as the villain. It's a shame though that the movie was released at the time it was. The Die Hard in a..... Sub genre had been way over done, and Van Damme was becoming less successful at the box office. As well as being very funny in places, it's also quite sadistic in the fact that the terrorists literally don't care who they kill. Elderly women, Wives, and head cooks, no one is safe. The films edited really well, and the action scenes look good and never get too over the top, despite the fact Van Damme has a fight with a giant penguin. In my opinion it's his best film of the nineties and it never gets boring, thanks to Boothe and a great performance from Van Damme. If you've never seen a Van Damme film and are not I to martial arts movies, this is for you.

    This is an extremely entertaining movie that never lets up. If you like (or love) Stallone or Schwarzenegar, chances are you'll like Van Damme. With either of the aforementioned actors also in the role, the results would have been the same. Of course, it's inevitable in most of these kinds of action pictures that one of the good guys turns out not to be good after all. Why? I have no clue. This character is played by Dorian Harewood, whom you might recognize from the TV series "7th Heaven". This is the way action movies should be: Suspenseful, entertaining, and thought-provoking. ***1/2 out of ****

His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things. Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, my country's most profitable export product (right behind beer, chocolate and waffles), stars in what is arguably one of the top three best films of his career. I deliberately state top three, because personally I'm also a big fan of "Death Warrant" and "Hard Target" even though I might be the only one. "Sudden Death" is a typical "Die Hard" clone, like there were far too many of them throughout the nineties, but it's one of the chosen few that are actually great fun and closely approaching the quality level of the actual "Die Hard" sequels (not the one and only original, of course). This accomplishment is largely thanks to the craftsmanship of director Peter Hyams and  also typical for major action blockbusters  the presence of a genuinely evil villain you just hate to love. In this particular case it's Powers Booth who depicts his terrorist/robber character continuously straight-faced and seemingly emotionless regardless of who he kills or what challenge overcomes him. Booth and his equally evil platoon of accomplices invade the Vice Presidents' lounge during the prestigious Stanley Cup ice-hockey finale and demand for a whole lot of money to be transferred to secret bank accounts all across the globe. If there aren't sufficient transfers at the end of each game period, Booth kills off one of the hostages. In case the whole sum isn't transferred at the end of the game, he threatens to blow up the entire stadium with everyone in it. Luckily for the thousands of (unaware) spectators, the tough former fireman JCVD is the arena's responsible fire safety inspector and Power Booth made the terrible mistake of taking his young daughter hostage. "Sudden Death" guarantees adrenalin-rushes from start to finish, with violent shootouts as well as brutal hand combat battles, a suspenseful race-against-the-clock aspect, a bit of disaster-movie mayhem near the finale and a handful of cool (if predictable) plot twists. I wouldn't know what to possibly expect more from a 90's action movie.

    Back in his heyday, martial arts sensation Jean Claude Van Damme was fighting titans like Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and Attila. But in this movie, JCVD (playing Darren McCord) is reduced to fighting a hockey team's mascot (which looks like a cross between a hen and a penguin) -- and worst of all he comes very close to losing. And that fight scene really sums up this entire movie. Jean Claude Van Damme was in his element when he was playing unapologetically macho guys in movies that were so cheesy, so laid back, and so consciously silly that they were funny and fun to watch. In addition, some of Van Damme's martial arts fight scenes in those laid back, silly films were brilliant in terms of their execution. But in director Peter Hyams' "Sudden Death," all of that cheesy, laid back, silliness that made the JCVD movies so entertaining was lost in a barrage of loud and remarkably boring shoot em ups, explosions, and stunts. Plus the martial arts fights in this movie are few and far between and nothing compared to the wonderful martial arts sequences in JCVD films like "Bloodsport," "Kickboxer," and even (shockingly enough) "Black Eagle." As for the plot, I will not go into all the details about why this movie is awful because there is simply not enough room in this review for that. Suffice it to say, there are two main problems. To begin with, the lead villain (who is so boring that I honestly forgot his name) explains right in the beginning that he will shoot people if $500 million of U.S. government money is not delivered into his bank account by the end of a (get this) period in a hockey game. Hockey, for those who do not follow the sport, has three periods, which leads one to conclude that the villain wants $1.5 billion in all. This scene, where the lead villain explains his plan, sucks out most of this film's excitement and suspense because predictably enough when the first and second periods of the hockey game end, people die violent deaths in scenes that are identical to each other. If that is not bad enough, this film tacks on a ridiculous plot twist at the end of the third period. Apparently the hockey teams are drawn 4-4 and go into sudden death, which inexplicably influences the lead villain to postpone his original plan to kill everyone in the hockey stadium (which he says he will do if all the money is not delivered by the end of the third period) to the end of "sudden death," giving Van Damme just enough time to save the dumb hockey fans. Maybe I could have excused this flawed plot, if the villains were given interesting things to say and do. But the villains in "Sudden Death" are very dull fellows and not frightening at all. As a result, we are not concerned about their potential victims and we are not entertained by the villains. So my advice is to have fun reading this review, have a few laughs, and be glad that you missed this film.

    Fans attending the NHL Stanley Cup 7th game between Chicago and Pittsburgh certainly get more than they could ever anticipate at any game. They even have our hero Jean C. Van Damme in the game thwarting goals by the opposing team. The violence abounds here with just about everyone either dodging or taking bullets. Powers Boothe shines as the man hell-bent on having funds transferred to various banks under the threat of blowing the stadium apart. He holds the Vice President and others as hostages and shows how ruthless he can really become. Hostages are shot including the mayor's hysterical sobbing wife. Van Damme takes on the Rambo like character with a charismatic force. Naturally, his children are on the scene and he has something to prove as two years before, he was unable to rescue a child in a fire.

    Darren McCord takes his two kids to a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play- off game. Unbeknown to him, the sports arena has been taken over by terrorists, who are holding the Vice President of the United States, as well as many other high-ranking officials hostage. Darren later becomes the only one who is aware of the situation. And, the stakes are raised when the terrorists announce that they will blow-up the building at the end of the game. Therefore, Darren must not only subdue the terrorists, but postpone the game and send it to overtime..... Oh yes, the film is silly, and full of gaping plot holes, but for heavens sake, it's a really fun movie with a really good performance from Van Damme (his relationship with his children is spot on), and Powers Boothe, looking like he's having the time of his life as the villain. It's a shame though that the movie was released at the time it was. The Die Hard in a..... Sub genre had been way over done, and Van Damme was becoming less successful at the box office. As well as being very funny in places, it's also quite sadistic in the fact that the terrorists literally don't care who they kill. Elderly women, Wives, and head cooks, no one is safe. The films edited really well, and the action scenes look good and never get too over the top, despite the fact Van Damme has a fight with a giant penguin. In my opinion it's his best film of the nineties and it never gets boring, thanks to Boothe and a great performance from Van Damme. If you've never seen a Van Damme film and are not I to martial arts movies, this is for you.

    This is an extremely entertaining movie that never lets up. If you like (or love) Stallone or Schwarzenegar, chances are you'll like Van Damme. With either of the aforementioned actors also in the role, the results would have been the same. Of course, it's inevitable in most of these kinds of action pictures that one of the good guys turns out not to be good after all. Why? I have no clue. This character is played by Dorian Harewood, whom you might recognize from the TV series "7th Heaven". This is the way action movies should be: Suspenseful, entertaining, and thought-provoking. ***1/2 out of ****

    Coming towards the back-end of Jean-Claude Van Damme's popularity with movie-goers (although the fans would stick with him), "Sudden Death" would be an huge improvement over his previous feature "Street Fighter" but only to be short-lived with what was to follow in the late-90s. Really he didn't fall away like some other 80s and 90s action stars, but actually made some decent features even if they were straight to video. Anyhow "Sudden Death" would be directed (and photographed) by Peter Hyams, who previously in the year before guided Van Damme in "Timecop". What we get is a fashionably conventional, but tautly exciting siege standoff like something in the sorts of "Die Hard", although done during a sporting spectacle meaning a stadium load of victims (at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena) are virtually unaware of the danger. Van Damme is the only one who can stop these terrorists who are holding the American vice-president for ransom in a private box. These guys mean business. Powers Boothe is terrifically commanding and genuinely threatening. While quite suave and quick with a witty response, he's one you wouldn't want to get on his bad side as there's no hesitations in the way he gets about things. Van Damme's ex-fire-fighter character (who is scared by a past incident) gets involved when his daughter is kidnapped and he goes about trying to spoil the terrorist's party by disabling their bombs while also taking some of them out. The expansive set-up might have been done to death and is elaborately plotted, but Hyams perfectly delivers the martial arts combat of its star (where can you see Van Damme take on the Pittsburgh Penguins' mascot) and the suspense of the situation to go with it. While slow and steady to start, where it feels played down suddenly becomes an assault on the senses with its busy pacing and bruising, brutal and unsparing violence that builds up to a heart stopping finale. "My daddy's a fireman."

    The muscles from Brussels plays Darren McCord, a divorced ex-firefighter who must contend with baddies when they, because the vice-president is taking in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finales, take a hockey arena hostage, that Darren's two kids happen to be at as well. This is one of Van Damme's more enjoyable films and even one of the better numerous Die Hard clones out there. The kids are annoying but that's pretty much the only major gripe I have about this action film. If you're a lover of the genre you'll enjoy this one, if you're a JCVD fan, you'll love it.

    Sudden Death Canadians are so vehement about hockey that no matter if their team wins or loses, they will still riot in the streets. Fortunately, the Canadian firefighter in this action movie is on-hand to extinguish overturned police cruises. Unable to perform his firefighting duties, a disgraced fireman, Darren (Jean Claude Van Damme), takes a fire marshal position with the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. On the same night his children are attending Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, however, so too is a terrorist (Powers Boothe), who has just taken the place hostage. With the arena rigged to go off at the end of the game, Darren must now send the game into overtime before he can defuse the bombs. A forgotten gem from the rogue-hostage genre, Sudden Death's greatness lines in its sublime lunacy. I mean, why would anyone want to blow up a hockey arena if Don Cherry wasn't inside?

    According to the 'action movie cookbook', the recipe is pretty straight-forward. As dictated by "Die Hard" back in 1988, the film must be set in a specific location (skyscraper, naval vessel, airport, etc) and have a lone-wolf hero out-manned and out-gunned by the baddies who have taken said location over. Of course, the professionals will try to save the day but they'll bodge it, leaving it to our hero to save the day in a dramatic and explosive manner before rescuing his loved ones (who are naturally held hostage somehow) and becoming a better person at the end of it. That could probably describe perhaps 75% of all action movies released since then and I'm afraid that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't going to start improvising with the formula. This may be as predictable as a season of Scottish Premier League football but it's entertaining enough without stretching its boundaries or your imagination too far. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, a traumatised fireman now reduced to acting as fire marshal at the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey team. Which is handy when the final game of the Stanley Cup rolls into town along with the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) to watch the game. McCord takes his two kids along (Ross Malinger and Whittni Wright) but trouble isn't far away - a crazed terrorist (Powers Boothe) takes control of the stadium and the executive box when the VP is held hostage along with other dignitaries. It's soon up to McCord to take the fight to the terrorists while outside the stadium, the police effort led by Secret Service agent Hallmark (Dorian Harewood) struggles to get involved... I could go on detailing the plot but I reckon that you can fill in the blanks yourself. "Sudden Death" has little spark of originality or imagination, remaining content to tick off each genre clich&eacute; in order until the inevitable ending. I hasten to add that this is a decent enough action movie - certainly, you know what to expect from JCVD and he doesn't disappoint in the fight scenes. As a hero, though, he remains pretty vacant and is thoroughly outshone by Boothe (when asked what sort of lunatic he is, he replies "The best kind!") who displays more charisma than Van Damme could ever hope to muster. Ignoring the minutiae of the plot which, frankly, is pretty tenuous at best then this is the sort of guys-night-in garbage that you could happily rent and not feel short-changed at. Action veterans, however, might be a little annoyed. For me, the best moment was the fight between Van Damme and a seven-foot-tall cuddly penguin in a kitchen which had more thought put into it than the rest of the film put together. Naturally, they stumble into everything remotely dangerous in a kitchen - meat slicer, deep fat fryer, dishwasher, tenderiser, you name it. But from there, the action seems to come in fits and starts when McCord begins trying to track the bombs planted in the stadium. It may strive for comparisons to "Die Hard" but I'm afraid that "Sudden Death" felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing, much like Steven Seagal's "Under Siege" did. It knows what action fans want and it provides all the fist-pumping, roundhouse-kicking nonsense that they could ask for. But for me, there is a strange lack of quality to it - there are no surprises in store for anyone other than the fact that nobody gets hit with a skate and there isn't even a love interest to provide some much-needed eye candy amid the ricocheting bullets and ill-lit steamy pipe-work (which is bathed in a red light for reasons I cannot possibly fathom other than it makes Van Damme look hard). I also didn't like the ending which felt and looked badly written, executed and just didn't feel right. Van Damme has made better films than this - "Universal Soldier" remains my favourite of his while "Timecop" is also held in high esteem by fans of the Muscles From Brussels. But "Sudden Death" is an adequate enough time-passer but not likely to change the world any time soon. I was always more into American Football anyway...

    When I was in my teenage years, growing up in the nineties I loved a good action flick with Jean Claude Van Damme. He wasn't my favourite hero but he was always good for action. I thought I remembered Sudden Death being one of my favourites so I was anxious to watch it again. I'm glad I did because man was it bad. I was completely entertained but now that I've seen so many more movies and become something of a connoisseur I can see all the ridiculously huge plot holes with a movie like this. I mean any good action film requires you to suspend some belief but I'm talking ridiculous gaping plot holes that are just ignored. How is that terrorists completely overtake a stadium during the biggest sporting event ever, blow up cars outside the stadium, have massive gunfights and perform other acts of terrorism without anyone inside the stadium ever having any idea? Its ludicrous. This is only one example but its a major one. The acting for the most part is wooden and even Van Damme who at least has a strong chemistry on screen just doesn't really come alive in this one. Still with those downsides the film is still fun and entertaining and still has some worthy action scenes. Many will poke fun at Jean-Claude Van Damme for his acting abilities but he was a nineties king for a brief moment. He was a martial arts/action superstar and this seems almost primed for him. The unfortunate part is they misuse him. He hardly does any martial arts and just seems so out of place. His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things. Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing.

If you've never seen a Van Damme film and are not I to martial arts movies, this is for you.

    This is an extremely entertaining movie that never lets up. If you like (or love) Stallone or Schwarzenegar, chances are you'll like Van Damme. With either of the aforementioned actors also in the role, the results would have been the same. Of course, it's inevitable in most of these kinds of action pictures that one of the good guys turns out not to be good after all. Why? I have no clue. This character is played by Dorian Harewood, whom you might recognize from the TV series "7th Heaven". This is the way action movies should be: Suspenseful, entertaining, and thought-provoking. ***1/2 out of ****

    Coming towards the back-end of Jean-Claude Van Damme's popularity with movie-goers (although the fans would stick with him), "Sudden Death" would be an huge improvement over his previous feature "Street Fighter" but only to be short-lived with what was to follow in the late-90s. Really he didn't fall away like some other 80s and 90s action stars, but actually made some decent features even if they were straight to video. Anyhow "Sudden Death" would be directed (and photographed) by Peter Hyams, who previously in the year before guided Van Damme in "Timecop". What we get is a fashionably conventional, but tautly exciting siege standoff like something in the sorts of "Die Hard", although done during a sporting spectacle meaning a stadium load of victims (at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena) are virtually unaware of the danger. Van Damme is the only one who can stop these terrorists who are holding the American vice-president for ransom in a private box. These guys mean business. Powers Boothe is terrifically commanding and genuinely threatening. While quite suave and quick with a witty response, he's one you wouldn't want to get on his bad side as there's no hesitations in the way he gets about things. Van Damme's ex-fire-fighter character (who is scared by a past incident) gets involved when his daughter is kidnapped and he goes about trying to spoil the terrorist's party by disabling their bombs while also taking some of them out. The expansive set-up might have been done to death and is elaborately plotted, but Hyams perfectly delivers the martial arts combat of its star (where can you see Van Damme take on the Pittsburgh Penguins' mascot) and the suspense of the situation to go with it. While slow and steady to start, where it feels played down suddenly becomes an assault on the senses with its busy pacing and bruising, brutal and unsparing violence that builds up to a heart stopping finale. "My daddy's a fireman."

    The muscles from Brussels plays Darren McCord, a divorced ex-firefighter who must contend with baddies when they, because the vice-president is taking in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finales, take a hockey arena hostage, that Darren's two kids happen to be at as well. This is one of Van Damme's more enjoyable films and even one of the better numerous Die Hard clones out there. The kids are annoying but that's pretty much the only major gripe I have about this action film. If you're a lover of the genre you'll enjoy this one, if you're a JCVD fan, you'll love it.

    Sudden Death Canadians are so vehement about hockey that no matter if their team wins or loses, they will still riot in the streets. Fortunately, the Canadian firefighter in this action movie is on-hand to extinguish overturned police cruises. Unable to perform his firefighting duties, a disgraced fireman, Darren (Jean Claude Van Damme), takes a fire marshal position with the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. On the same night his children are attending Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, however, so too is a terrorist (Powers Boothe), who has just taken the place hostage. With the arena rigged to go off at the end of the game, Darren must now send the game into overtime before he can defuse the bombs. A forgotten gem from the rogue-hostage genre, Sudden Death's greatness lines in its sublime lunacy. I mean, why would anyone want to blow up a hockey arena if Don Cherry wasn't inside?

    According to the 'action movie cookbook', the recipe is pretty straight-forward. As dictated by "Die Hard" back in 1988, the film must be set in a specific location (skyscraper, naval vessel, airport, etc) and have a lone-wolf hero out-manned and out-gunned by the baddies who have taken said location over. Of course, the professionals will try to save the day but they'll bodge it, leaving it to our hero to save the day in a dramatic and explosive manner before rescuing his loved ones (who are naturally held hostage somehow) and becoming a better person at the end of it. That could probably describe perhaps 75% of all action movies released since then and I'm afraid that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't going to start improvising with the formula. This may be as predictable as a season of Scottish Premier League football but it's entertaining enough without stretching its boundaries or your imagination too far. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, a traumatised fireman now reduced to acting as fire marshal at the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey team. Which is handy when the final game of the Stanley Cup rolls into town along with the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) to watch the game. McCord takes his two kids along (Ross Malinger and Whittni Wright) but trouble isn't far away - a crazed terrorist (Powers Boothe) takes control of the stadium and the executive box when the VP is held hostage along with other dignitaries. It's soon up to McCord to take the fight to the terrorists while outside the stadium, the police effort led by Secret Service agent Hallmark (Dorian Harewood) struggles to get involved... I could go on detailing the plot but I reckon that you can fill in the blanks yourself. "Sudden Death" has little spark of originality or imagination, remaining content to tick off each genre clich&eacute; in order until the inevitable ending. I hasten to add that this is a decent enough action movie - certainly, you know what to expect from JCVD and he doesn't disappoint in the fight scenes. As a hero, though, he remains pretty vacant and is thoroughly outshone by Boothe (when asked what sort of lunatic he is, he replies "The best kind!") who displays more charisma than Van Damme could ever hope to muster. Ignoring the minutiae of the plot which, frankly, is pretty tenuous at best then this is the sort of guys-night-in garbage that you could happily rent and not feel short-changed at. Action veterans, however, might be a little annoyed. For me, the best moment was the fight between Van Damme and a seven-foot-tall cuddly penguin in a kitchen which had more thought put into it than the rest of the film put together. Naturally, they stumble into everything remotely dangerous in a kitchen - meat slicer, deep fat fryer, dishwasher, tenderiser, you name it. But from there, the action seems to come in fits and starts when McCord begins trying to track the bombs planted in the stadium. It may strive for comparisons to "Die Hard" but I'm afraid that "Sudden Death" felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing, much like Steven Seagal's "Under Siege" did. It knows what action fans want and it provides all the fist-pumping, roundhouse-kicking nonsense that they could ask for. But for me, there is a strange lack of quality to it - there are no surprises in store for anyone other than the fact that nobody gets hit with a skate and there isn't even a love interest to provide some much-needed eye candy amid the ricocheting bullets and ill-lit steamy pipe-work (which is bathed in a red light for reasons I cannot possibly fathom other than it makes Van Damme look hard). I also didn't like the ending which felt and looked badly written, executed and just didn't feel right. Van Damme has made better films than this - "Universal Soldier" remains my favourite of his while "Timecop" is also held in high esteem by fans of the Muscles From Brussels. But "Sudden Death" is an adequate enough time-passer but not likely to change the world any time soon. I was always more into American Football anyway...

    When I was in my teenage years, growing up in the nineties I loved a good action flick with Jean Claude Van Damme. He wasn't my favourite hero but he was always good for action. I thought I remembered Sudden Death being one of my favourites so I was anxious to watch it again. I'm glad I did because man was it bad. I was completely entertained but now that I've seen so many more movies and become something of a connoisseur I can see all the ridiculously huge plot holes with a movie like this. I mean any good action film requires you to suspend some belief but I'm talking ridiculous gaping plot holes that are just ignored. How is that terrorists completely overtake a stadium during the biggest sporting event ever, blow up cars outside the stadium, have massive gunfights and perform other acts of terrorism without anyone inside the stadium ever having any idea? Its ludicrous. This is only one example but its a major one. The acting for the most part is wooden and even Van Damme who at least has a strong chemistry on screen just doesn't really come alive in this one. Still with those downsides the film is still fun and entertaining and still has some worthy action scenes. Many will poke fun at Jean-Claude Van Damme for his acting abilities but he was a nineties king for a brief moment. He was a martial arts/action superstar and this seems almost primed for him. The unfortunate part is they misuse him. He hardly does any martial arts and just seems so out of place. His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things. Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, my country's most profitable export product (right behind beer, chocolate and waffles), stars in what is arguably one of the top three best films of his career. I deliberately state top three, because personally I'm also a big fan of "Death Warrant" and "Hard Target" even though I might be the only one. "Sudden Death" is a typical "Die Hard" clone, like there were far too many of them throughout the nineties, but it's one of the chosen few that are actually great fun and closely approaching the quality level of the actual "Die Hard" sequels (not the one and only original, of course). This accomplishment is largely thanks to the craftsmanship of director Peter Hyams and  also typical for major action blockbusters  the presence of a genuinely evil villain you just hate to love. In this particular case it's Powers Booth who depicts his terrorist/robber character continuously straight-faced and seemingly emotionless regardless of who he kills or what challenge overcomes him. Booth and his equally evil platoon of accomplices invade the Vice Presidents' lounge during the prestigious Stanley Cup ice-hockey finale and demand for a whole lot of money to be transferred to secret bank accounts all across the globe. If there aren't sufficient transfers at the end of each game period, Booth kills off one of the hostages. In case the whole sum isn't transferred at the end of the game, he threatens to blow up the entire stadium with everyone in it. Luckily for the thousands of (unaware) spectators, the tough former fireman JCVD is the arena's responsible fire safety inspector and Power Booth made the terrible mistake of taking his young daughter hostage. "Sudden Death" guarantees adrenalin-rushes from start to finish, with violent shootouts as well as brutal hand combat battles, a suspenseful race-against-the-clock aspect, a bit of disaster-movie mayhem near the finale and a handful of cool (if predictable) plot twists. I wouldn't know what to possibly expect more from a 90's action movie.

    Back in his heyday, martial arts sensation Jean Claude Van Damme was fighting titans like Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and Attila. But in this movie, JCVD (playing Darren McCord) is reduced to fighting a hockey team's mascot (which looks like a cross between a hen and a penguin) -- and worst of all he comes very close to losing. And that fight scene really sums up this entire movie. Jean Claude Van Damme was in his element when he was playing unapologetically macho guys in movies that were so cheesy, so laid back, and so consciously silly that they were funny and fun to watch. In addition, some of Van Damme's martial arts fight scenes in those laid back, silly films were brilliant in terms of their execution. But in director Peter Hyams' "Sudden Death," all of that cheesy, laid back, silliness that made the JCVD movies so entertaining was lost in a barrage of loud and remarkably boring shoot em ups, explosions, and stunts. Plus the martial arts fights in this movie are few and far between and nothing compared to the wonderful martial arts sequences in JCVD films like "Bloodsport," "Kickboxer," and even (shockingly enough) "Black Eagle." As for the plot, I will not go into all the details about why this movie is awful because there is simply not enough room in this review for that. Suffice it to say, there are two main problems. To begin with, the lead villain (who is so boring that I honestly forgot his name) explains right in the beginning that he will shoot people if $500 million of U.S. government money is not delivered into his bank account by the end of a (get this) period in a hockey game. Hockey, for those who do not follow the sport, has three periods, which leads one to conclude that the villain wants $1.5 billion in all. This scene, where the lead villain explains his plan, sucks out most of this film's excitement and suspense because predictably enough when the first and second periods of the hockey game end, people die violent deaths in scenes that are identical to each other. If that is not bad enough, this film tacks on a ridiculous plot twist at the end of the third period. Apparently the hockey teams are drawn 4-4 and go into sudden death, which inexplicably influences the lead villain to postpone his original plan to kill everyone in the hockey stadium (which he says he will do if all the money is not delivered by the end of the third period) to the end of "sudden death," giving Van Damme just enough time to save the dumb hockey fans. Maybe I could have excused this flawed plot, if the villains were given interesting things to say and do. But the villains in "Sudden Death" are very dull fellows and not frightening at all. As a result, we are not concerned about their potential victims and we are not entertained by the villains. So my advice is to have fun reading this review, have a few laughs, and be glad that you missed this film.

    Fans attending the NHL Stanley Cup 7th game between Chicago and Pittsburgh certainly get more than they could ever anticipate at any game. They even have our hero Jean C. Van Damme in the game thwarting goals by the opposing team. The violence abounds here with just about everyone either dodging or taking bullets. Powers Boothe shines as the man hell-bent on having funds transferred to various banks under the threat of blowing the stadium apart. He holds the Vice President and others as hostages and shows how ruthless he can really become. Hostages are shot including the mayor's hysterical sobbing wife. Van Damme takes on the Rambo like character with a charismatic force. Naturally, his children are on the scene and he has something to prove as two years before, he was unable to rescue a child in a fire.

    Darren McCord takes his two kids to a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play- off game. Unbeknown to him, the sports arena has been taken over by terrorists, who are holding the Vice President of the United States, as well as many other high-ranking officials hostage. Darren later becomes the only one who is aware of the situation. And, the stakes are raised when the terrorists announce that they will blow-up the building at the end of the game. Therefore, Darren must not only subdue the terrorists, but postpone the game and send it to overtime..... Oh yes, the film is silly, and full of gaping plot holes, but for heavens sake, it's a really fun movie with a really good performance from Van Damme (his relationship with his children is spot on), and Powers Boothe, looking like he's having the time of his life as the villain. It's a shame though that the movie was released at the time it was. The Die Hard in a..... Sub genre had been way over done, and Van Damme was becoming less successful at the box office. As well as being very funny in places, it's also quite sadistic in the fact that the terrorists literally don't care who they kill. Elderly women, Wives, and head cooks, no one is safe. The films edited really well, and the action scenes look good and never get too over the top, despite the fact Van Damme has a fight with a giant penguin. In my opinion it's his best film of the nineties and it never gets boring, thanks to Boothe and a great performance from Van Damme. If you've never seen a Van Damme film and are not I to martial arts movies, this is for you.
