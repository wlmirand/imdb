 <sinopse>
  Three trappers protect a British Colonel's daughters in the midst of the French and Indian War.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  British and French troops do battle in colonial America, with aid from various native American war parties. The British troops enlist the help of local colonial militia men, who are reluctant to leave their homes undefended. A budding romance between a British officer's daughter and an independent man who was reared as a Mohican complicates things for the British officer, as the adopted Mohican pursues his own agenda despite the wrath of different people on both sides of the conflict.

    Sure I could trot off here a number of flaws, I suppose the same flaws that are generally levelled against the film. We have constructed history of a similar sort to what we complain about in Spielberg. We have simple dualities: nobility and barbarity, law and instinct, sin and redemption, and a lot of effort that goes to shuffle these so that each surfaces in the others, for instance so that the lawful English officer can be shown to be the opposite and noble again in the end. And Day-Lewis was not as interesting at this point, doing a role that DiCaprio could do now. But there's an intuitive horizon here that is worth bypassing all that stuff for. To get there we have to wait for the film to shift from the 'white' world of structured chaos to the 'indian' world of primeval urges. It's the same effect that Mann used in Manhunter, where again we had the shift from the detective-world of logic and narrative to the killer's world of visual urges and logic of a different, intuitive kind. The transition happens in a marvelous scene behind a waterfall, every element in that scene is great, the flickering shadows on cave walls, the concealment against flowing sheets of water, the jump and fall. Everything before that isn't of much interest to me, but past that point the film hits me in a similar way to Malick. Within this more conventionally fabricated story it may not register, but I find here the same ecstatic camera that I saw in New World, an attempt to sculpt in a different timeflow. The motions of falling bodies against the void, characters staring from afar at the moment of departure. It's good stuff that reminds me why I'm drawn to Mann much more than his peers.. He seems intuitively drawn to the notion that these emotional urges in moving us create stories, that all stories are more or less logical attempts to account for mysterious workings in the soul; he was most clear about this in Manhunter but he attempts to know it again in most of his films, even as he kids himself with the detective story. He didn't gamble here, you can experience this in the typical way. He did in Public Enemies but people balked. They wanted this, the conventionally fabricated history.

    Director Michael Mann brings violence, brutality, romance, and striking visuals to dusty old history. Maj Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) is bringing reinforcements to Ft. William Henry with Col Munro's daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) when they're betrayed by Magua (Wes Studi). Only the timely arrival of Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his two companions saved their lives. This is an old fashion epic infused with modern brutality and violence. I will not debate historical accuracy. That's beyond the point here. It's a romantic melodrama using some real events as backdrop. The action is powerfully done. The brutal violence is even more powerful due to the close quarters nature of the battles. There is no CG in this one. They're doing the real physical stuff.

    Am I missing something more here ? Missed this highly recommended mega flick during the 90's ,was rooting for it and finally got the directors cut on bluray .The movie experience was far below the expectations however !!! The story line is weak with "Injun" adopted white man instantly falling in love with English colonel's daughter being allowed so , even acknowledged publicly during the height of a colonial FrenchEnglish hate campaign , another of the colonel's kin falling in instantaneous love with the savage "Injun" boy , even instantly sacrificing the life for him by jumping off the cliff . Fluent French and English speaking red Indians , three men stalking the forest decimating every hoard of opponents ( of whatever number strength ) they meet everywhere , in the midst of a brutal Indian ambush on the retreating defeated English the clearly recognizable shirt sporting rival clan three Indians are allowed to dodge every bullet , club and tomahawk flung at them ... or do they have to ? everyone ... friend or foe alike seem to make way for them to facilitate escape with their chosen ones indeed totally unharmed !!! Daniel DeyLewis has done much better acting elsewhere .. nothing much that he can do to make the unconvincing violent spectacle more acceptable !! The musical score and photography were the only impressive features in this much hyped bloodshot 'epic' . Albeit the overdoing , the final mountain chase and individual decimation loop was the only gripping segment for me . On any day i would rate " The last Samurai " or even " Dances with wolves " way much higher than this movie rightfully discounted by the Oscar academy !!! Wait a minute ...was that a Bollywood reel that i was watching ?

    "The Last of the Mohicans" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of its time. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures with everyone being involved. This movie has a bit of action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and it appears that he has researched well into the James Fenimore Cooper's book on which the movie is based. The story is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters  Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice Munro (Jodhi May) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children. This is by far Mann's best film yet and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious. This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy; complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during that hectic time period. MY RATING: 9/10

    The Last of the Mohicans is a fantastic movie with a storyline that is really well developed and a very talented cast that all deliver very fine and strong performances.Obviously the best performance was from Daniel Day-Lewis,he is probably one of the greatest actors of all time,he is so believable and he puts so much heart into all of his performances.His performance as Hawkeye was truly breathtaking and i'm so shocked he didn't even get an Academy Award nomination,it definitely isn't his best performance,but it's really good.AI also really love the soundtrack to this movie,the music is so beautiful and it really suits the overall setting.My only problem really is that it wasn't long enough,it goes by so quickly and when it ends I felt like there could have been so much more,it was an hour and fifty minutes,but it feels much shorter.I strongly recommend this movie to all fans of Daniel Day Lewis and Michael Mann. During the war between Britain and France over America,three men must do all they can to keep a Colonel's daughter safe.

    The last of the Mohicans is for me an epic movie, the best adventure film ever made. Its a masterpiece in all: Great cast, great battles, great photography but the best of this movie is the masterful soundtrack, its truly the best soundtrack of any film ever and is unforgettable. The opening scene is epic. I love the movies, which their opening scenes has great music. Daniel Day-Lewis do a memorable performance, its impressive how he act, he has good vocabulary and his quotes are awesome. Michael Mann does a great job mixing romance and action. The most important thing about this movie is the final scene that is considered for me an epic and powerful scene, I can't describe what I feel when I hear the soundtrack at this scene, its simply epic. This movie was the first great job that Mann did, but Heat is his best movie. The movie won an academy award for best sound, but it didn't get the academy award for best soundtrack and is truly not fair, its unforgiven. An all-time classic that I watch three times each year.

    As a Daniel Day-Lewis fan, I really looked forward watching this movie. Having heard good critics about the film, I actually expected many things; electrifying performance by Day-Lewis, a nice cinematography and direction, strong side characters, impressive battles. However, after the film ended I found it hard to vote. The film wasn't bad at all. At some extend it did have what I expected, but in a lesser degree. None of the characters had a real depth and that lead to the actors to just perform 'alright'. Duncan and Magua were perhaps the most interesting characters of the story. The British officer was in love with a woman who never wanted him and even died for her, while the Huron warrior was driven by vengeance and it was revealed that his mind was closer to that of the 'White Man'. I also found the writing to be quite shallow. Most important of all, Hawkeye and Cora's romance felt flat - it felt like there was no chemistry between the two. And after all, there is almost no memorable quote from this film. Without a doubt, the soundtrack was the movie's only flawless part; magical.

    The Last of the Mohicans is the proper use of your Michael Mann. A good story mixed with good performances and top notch direction. This is well done action film with good story, good characters and perfect ending that will send chills up your spine. Michael Mann just got everything right when he made this film from the casting, the script and the direction. It's very well paced, superbly shot and leaves a strong impact after you have seen it. Unlike most films surrounding the American history, The Last of the Mohicans just wants to entertain you without beating you over the head with it's message. Also it doesn't hurt when you have one of the best actors in the last 20 years leading your film. Overall it's a very good film that understands how to tell a simple story that will please the general audience and won't insult your intelligence.

    Dark, boring, yellow-lensed version of the well-known story of the same name. Former NFL linebacker D.D. Lewis walks through this bad script; the direction isn't much better. Too many talky moments slow things down, but just when you're ready to go do something more interesting, like take out the garbage, another battle scene pops up -- yeah, that's what this movie needed! Some pop-ups or some really good spam to mix things up a little. Maybe the next time I'm watching this flick (that could happen), I'll get an email from the film-makers telling me how much they loved this movie review. Strictly by-the-numbers; D.D. Lewis quit the Dallas Cowboys for this?

    I've probably seen this three or four times now. I personally rate this as one of my all-time favorites. It is comparable to other great historical action/adventure movies like Braveheart and Gladiator, but what makes this better is the music. It is haunting but at the same time inspiring. The name of the theme song is The Gael and I could probably listen to it all day. There is little to complain about with this movie. Maybe the romantic part was a little bit forced. It seemed like it happened too quickly in my opinion. Also, Uncas and the younger sister should've had some more speaking lines.

It's the same effect that Mann used in Manhunter, where again we had the shift from the detective-world of logic and narrative to the killer's world of visual urges and logic of a different, intuitive kind. The transition happens in a marvelous scene behind a waterfall, every element in that scene is great, the flickering shadows on cave walls, the concealment against flowing sheets of water, the jump and fall. Everything before that isn't of much interest to me, but past that point the film hits me in a similar way to Malick. Within this more conventionally fabricated story it may not register, but I find here the same ecstatic camera that I saw in New World, an attempt to sculpt in a different timeflow. The motions of falling bodies against the void, characters staring from afar at the moment of departure. It's good stuff that reminds me why I'm drawn to Mann much more than his peers.. He seems intuitively drawn to the notion that these emotional urges in moving us create stories, that all stories are more or less logical attempts to account for mysterious workings in the soul; he was most clear about this in Manhunter but he attempts to know it again in most of his films, even as he kids himself with the detective story. He didn't gamble here, you can experience this in the typical way. He did in Public Enemies but people balked. They wanted this, the conventionally fabricated history.

    Director Michael Mann brings violence, brutality, romance, and striking visuals to dusty old history. Maj Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) is bringing reinforcements to Ft. William Henry with Col Munro's daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) when they're betrayed by Magua (Wes Studi). Only the timely arrival of Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his two companions saved their lives. This is an old fashion epic infused with modern brutality and violence. I will not debate historical accuracy. That's beyond the point here. It's a romantic melodrama using some real events as backdrop. The action is powerfully done. The brutal violence is even more powerful due to the close quarters nature of the battles. There is no CG in this one. They're doing the real physical stuff.

    Am I missing something more here ? Missed this highly recommended mega flick during the 90's ,was rooting for it and finally got the directors cut on bluray .The movie experience was far below the expectations however !!! The story line is weak with "Injun" adopted white man instantly falling in love with English colonel's daughter being allowed so , even acknowledged publicly during the height of a colonial FrenchEnglish hate campaign , another of the colonel's kin falling in instantaneous love with the savage "Injun" boy , even instantly sacrificing the life for him by jumping off the cliff . Fluent French and English speaking red Indians , three men stalking the forest decimating every hoard of opponents ( of whatever number strength ) they meet everywhere , in the midst of a brutal Indian ambush on the retreating defeated English the clearly recognizable shirt sporting rival clan three Indians are allowed to dodge every bullet , club and tomahawk flung at them ... or do they have to ? everyone ... friend or foe alike seem to make way for them to facilitate escape with their chosen ones indeed totally unharmed !!! Daniel DeyLewis has done much better acting elsewhere .. nothing much that he can do to make the unconvincing violent spectacle more acceptable !! The musical score and photography were the only impressive features in this much hyped bloodshot 'epic' . Albeit the overdoing , the final mountain chase and individual decimation loop was the only gripping segment for me . On any day i would rate " The last Samurai " or even " Dances with wolves " way much higher than this movie rightfully discounted by the Oscar academy !!! Wait a minute ...was that a Bollywood reel that i was watching ?

    "The Last of the Mohicans" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of its time. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures with everyone being involved. This movie has a bit of action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and it appears that he has researched well into the James Fenimore Cooper's book on which the movie is based. The story is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters  Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice Munro (Jodhi May) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children. This is by far Mann's best film yet and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious. This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy; complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during that hectic time period. MY RATING: 9/10

    The Last of the Mohicans is a fantastic movie with a storyline that is really well developed and a very talented cast that all deliver very fine and strong performances.Obviously the best performance was from Daniel Day-Lewis,he is probably one of the greatest actors of all time,he is so believable and he puts so much heart into all of his performances.His performance as Hawkeye was truly breathtaking and i'm so shocked he didn't even get an Academy Award nomination,it definitely isn't his best performance,but it's really good.AI also really love the soundtrack to this movie,the music is so beautiful and it really suits the overall setting.My only problem really is that it wasn't long enough,it goes by so quickly and when it ends I felt like there could have been so much more,it was an hour and fifty minutes,but it feels much shorter.I strongly recommend this movie to all fans of Daniel Day Lewis and Michael Mann. During the war between Britain and France over America,three men must do all they can to keep a Colonel's daughter safe.

    The last of the Mohicans is for me an epic movie, the best adventure film ever made. Its a masterpiece in all: Great cast, great battles, great photography but the best of this movie is the masterful soundtrack, its truly the best soundtrack of any film ever and is unforgettable. The opening scene is epic. I love the movies, which their opening scenes has great music. Daniel Day-Lewis do a memorable performance, its impressive how he act, he has good vocabulary and his quotes are awesome. Michael Mann does a great job mixing romance and action. The most important thing about this movie is the final scene that is considered for me an epic and powerful scene, I can't describe what I feel when I hear the soundtrack at this scene, its simply epic. This movie was the first great job that Mann did, but Heat is his best movie. The movie won an academy award for best sound, but it didn't get the academy award for best soundtrack and is truly not fair, its unforgiven. An all-time classic that I watch three times each year.

    As a Daniel Day-Lewis fan, I really looked forward watching this movie. Having heard good critics about the film, I actually expected many things; electrifying performance by Day-Lewis, a nice cinematography and direction, strong side characters, impressive battles. However, after the film ended I found it hard to vote. The film wasn't bad at all. At some extend it did have what I expected, but in a lesser degree. None of the characters had a real depth and that lead to the actors to just perform 'alright'. Duncan and Magua were perhaps the most interesting characters of the story. The British officer was in love with a woman who never wanted him and even died for her, while the Huron warrior was driven by vengeance and it was revealed that his mind was closer to that of the 'White Man'. I also found the writing to be quite shallow. Most important of all, Hawkeye and Cora's romance felt flat - it felt like there was no chemistry between the two. And after all, there is almost no memorable quote from this film. Without a doubt, the soundtrack was the movie's only flawless part; magical.

    The Last of the Mohicans is the proper use of your Michael Mann. A good story mixed with good performances and top notch direction. This is well done action film with good story, good characters and perfect ending that will send chills up your spine. Michael Mann just got everything right when he made this film from the casting, the script and the direction. It's very well paced, superbly shot and leaves a strong impact after you have seen it. Unlike most films surrounding the American history, The Last of the Mohicans just wants to entertain you without beating you over the head with it's message. Also it doesn't hurt when you have one of the best actors in the last 20 years leading your film. Overall it's a very good film that understands how to tell a simple story that will please the general audience and won't insult your intelligence.

    Dark, boring, yellow-lensed version of the well-known story of the same name. Former NFL linebacker D.D. Lewis walks through this bad script; the direction isn't much better. Too many talky moments slow things down, but just when you're ready to go do something more interesting, like take out the garbage, another battle scene pops up -- yeah, that's what this movie needed! Some pop-ups or some really good spam to mix things up a little. Maybe the next time I'm watching this flick (that could happen), I'll get an email from the film-makers telling me how much they loved this movie review. Strictly by-the-numbers; D.D. Lewis quit the Dallas Cowboys for this?

    I've probably seen this three or four times now. I personally rate this as one of my all-time favorites. It is comparable to other great historical action/adventure movies like Braveheart and Gladiator, but what makes this better is the music. It is haunting but at the same time inspiring. The name of the theme song is The Gael and I could probably listen to it all day. There is little to complain about with this movie. Maybe the romantic part was a little bit forced. It seemed like it happened too quickly in my opinion. Also, Uncas and the younger sister should've had some more speaking lines.

    Sure I could trot off here a number of flaws, I suppose the same flaws that are generally levelled against the film. We have constructed history of a similar sort to what we complain about in Spielberg. We have simple dualities: nobility and barbarity, law and instinct, sin and redemption, and a lot of effort that goes to shuffle these so that each surfaces in the others, for instance so that the lawful English officer can be shown to be the opposite and noble again in the end. And Day-Lewis was not as interesting at this point, doing a role that DiCaprio could do now. But there's an intuitive horizon here that is worth bypassing all that stuff for. To get there we have to wait for the film to shift from the 'white' world of structured chaos to the 'indian' world of primeval urges.

The story line is weak with "Injun" adopted white man instantly falling in love with English colonel's daughter being allowed so , even acknowledged publicly during the height of a colonial FrenchEnglish hate campaign , another of the colonel's kin falling in instantaneous love with the savage "Injun" boy , even instantly sacrificing the life for him by jumping off the cliff . Fluent French and English speaking red Indians , three men stalking the forest decimating every hoard of opponents ( of whatever number strength ) they meet everywhere , in the midst of a brutal Indian ambush on the retreating defeated English the clearly recognizable shirt sporting rival clan three Indians are allowed to dodge every bullet , club and tomahawk flung at them ... or do they have to ? everyone ... friend or foe alike seem to make way for them to facilitate escape with their chosen ones indeed totally unharmed !!! Daniel DeyLewis has done much better acting elsewhere .. nothing much that he can do to make the unconvincing violent spectacle more acceptable !! The musical score and photography were the only impressive features in this much hyped bloodshot 'epic' . Albeit the overdoing , the final mountain chase and individual decimation loop was the only gripping segment for me . On any day i would rate " The last Samurai " or even " Dances with wolves " way much higher than this movie rightfully discounted by the Oscar academy !!! Wait a minute ...was that a Bollywood reel that i was watching ?

    "The Last of the Mohicans" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of its time. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures with everyone being involved. This movie has a bit of action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and it appears that he has researched well into the James Fenimore Cooper's book on which the movie is based. The story is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters  Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice Munro (Jodhi May) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children. This is by far Mann's best film yet and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious. This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy; complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during that hectic time period. MY RATING: 9/10

    The Last of the Mohicans is a fantastic movie with a storyline that is really well developed and a very talented cast that all deliver very fine and strong performances.Obviously the best performance was from Daniel Day-Lewis,he is probably one of the greatest actors of all time,he is so believable and he puts so much heart into all of his performances.His performance as Hawkeye was truly breathtaking and i'm so shocked he didn't even get an Academy Award nomination,it definitely isn't his best performance,but it's really good.AI also really love the soundtrack to this movie,the music is so beautiful and it really suits the overall setting.My only problem really is that it wasn't long enough,it goes by so quickly and when it ends I felt like there could have been so much more,it was an hour and fifty minutes,but it feels much shorter.I strongly recommend this movie to all fans of Daniel Day Lewis and Michael Mann. During the war between Britain and France over America,three men must do all they can to keep a Colonel's daughter safe.

    The last of the Mohicans is for me an epic movie, the best adventure film ever made. Its a masterpiece in all: Great cast, great battles, great photography but the best of this movie is the masterful soundtrack, its truly the best soundtrack of any film ever and is unforgettable. The opening scene is epic. I love the movies, which their opening scenes has great music. Daniel Day-Lewis do a memorable performance, its impressive how he act, he has good vocabulary and his quotes are awesome. Michael Mann does a great job mixing romance and action. The most important thing about this movie is the final scene that is considered for me an epic and powerful scene, I can't describe what I feel when I hear the soundtrack at this scene, its simply epic. This movie was the first great job that Mann did, but Heat is his best movie. The movie won an academy award for best sound, but it didn't get the academy award for best soundtrack and is truly not fair, its unforgiven. An all-time classic that I watch three times each year.

    As a Daniel Day-Lewis fan, I really looked forward watching this movie. Having heard good critics about the film, I actually expected many things; electrifying performance by Day-Lewis, a nice cinematography and direction, strong side characters, impressive battles. However, after the film ended I found it hard to vote. The film wasn't bad at all. At some extend it did have what I expected, but in a lesser degree. None of the characters had a real depth and that lead to the actors to just perform 'alright'. Duncan and Magua were perhaps the most interesting characters of the story. The British officer was in love with a woman who never wanted him and even died for her, while the Huron warrior was driven by vengeance and it was revealed that his mind was closer to that of the 'White Man'. I also found the writing to be quite shallow. Most important of all, Hawkeye and Cora's romance felt flat - it felt like there was no chemistry between the two. And after all, there is almost no memorable quote from this film. Without a doubt, the soundtrack was the movie's only flawless part; magical.

    The Last of the Mohicans is the proper use of your Michael Mann. A good story mixed with good performances and top notch direction. This is well done action film with good story, good characters and perfect ending that will send chills up your spine. Michael Mann just got everything right when he made this film from the casting, the script and the direction. It's very well paced, superbly shot and leaves a strong impact after you have seen it. Unlike most films surrounding the American history, The Last of the Mohicans just wants to entertain you without beating you over the head with it's message. Also it doesn't hurt when you have one of the best actors in the last 20 years leading your film. Overall it's a very good film that understands how to tell a simple story that will please the general audience and won't insult your intelligence.

    Dark, boring, yellow-lensed version of the well-known story of the same name. Former NFL linebacker D.D. Lewis walks through this bad script; the direction isn't much better. Too many talky moments slow things down, but just when you're ready to go do something more interesting, like take out the garbage, another battle scene pops up -- yeah, that's what this movie needed! Some pop-ups or some really good spam to mix things up a little. Maybe the next time I'm watching this flick (that could happen), I'll get an email from the film-makers telling me how much they loved this movie review. Strictly by-the-numbers; D.D. Lewis quit the Dallas Cowboys for this?

    I've probably seen this three or four times now. I personally rate this as one of my all-time favorites. It is comparable to other great historical action/adventure movies like Braveheart and Gladiator, but what makes this better is the music. It is haunting but at the same time inspiring. The name of the theme song is The Gael and I could probably listen to it all day. There is little to complain about with this movie. Maybe the romantic part was a little bit forced. It seemed like it happened too quickly in my opinion. Also, Uncas and the younger sister should've had some more speaking lines.

    Sure I could trot off here a number of flaws, I suppose the same flaws that are generally levelled against the film. We have constructed history of a similar sort to what we complain about in Spielberg. We have simple dualities: nobility and barbarity, law and instinct, sin and redemption, and a lot of effort that goes to shuffle these so that each surfaces in the others, for instance so that the lawful English officer can be shown to be the opposite and noble again in the end. And Day-Lewis was not as interesting at this point, doing a role that DiCaprio could do now. But there's an intuitive horizon here that is worth bypassing all that stuff for. To get there we have to wait for the film to shift from the 'white' world of structured chaos to the 'indian' world of primeval urges. It's the same effect that Mann used in Manhunter, where again we had the shift from the detective-world of logic and narrative to the killer's world of visual urges and logic of a different, intuitive kind. The transition happens in a marvelous scene behind a waterfall, every element in that scene is great, the flickering shadows on cave walls, the concealment against flowing sheets of water, the jump and fall. Everything before that isn't of much interest to me, but past that point the film hits me in a similar way to Malick. Within this more conventionally fabricated story it may not register, but I find here the same ecstatic camera that I saw in New World, an attempt to sculpt in a different timeflow. The motions of falling bodies against the void, characters staring from afar at the moment of departure. It's good stuff that reminds me why I'm drawn to Mann much more than his peers.. He seems intuitively drawn to the notion that these emotional urges in moving us create stories, that all stories are more or less logical attempts to account for mysterious workings in the soul; he was most clear about this in Manhunter but he attempts to know it again in most of his films, even as he kids himself with the detective story. He didn't gamble here, you can experience this in the typical way. He did in Public Enemies but people balked. They wanted this, the conventionally fabricated history.

    Director Michael Mann brings violence, brutality, romance, and striking visuals to dusty old history. Maj Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) is bringing reinforcements to Ft. William Henry with Col Munro's daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) when they're betrayed by Magua (Wes Studi). Only the timely arrival of Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his two companions saved their lives. This is an old fashion epic infused with modern brutality and violence. I will not debate historical accuracy. That's beyond the point here. It's a romantic melodrama using some real events as backdrop. The action is powerfully done. The brutal violence is even more powerful due to the close quarters nature of the battles. There is no CG in this one. They're doing the real physical stuff.

    "The Last of the Mohicans" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of its time. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures with everyone being involved. This movie has a bit of action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and it appears that he has researched well into the James Fenimore Cooper's book on which the movie is based. The story is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters  Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice Munro (Jodhi May) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children. This is by far Mann's best film yet and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect.

    The Last of the Mohicans is a fantastic movie with a storyline that is really well developed and a very talented cast that all deliver very fine and strong performances.Obviously the best performance was from Daniel Day-Lewis,he is probably one of the greatest actors of all time,he is so believable and he puts so much heart into all of his performances.His performance as Hawkeye was truly breathtaking and i'm so shocked he didn't even get an Academy Award nomination,it definitely isn't his best performance,but it's really good.AI also really love the soundtrack to this movie,the music is so beautiful and it really suits the overall setting.My only problem really is that it wasn't long enough,it goes by so quickly and when it ends I felt like there could have been so much more,it was an hour and fifty minutes,but it feels much shorter.I strongly recommend this movie to all fans of Daniel Day Lewis and Michael Mann. During the war between Britain and France over America,three men must do all they can to keep a Colonel's daughter safe.

    The last of the Mohicans is for me an epic movie, the best adventure film ever made. Its a masterpiece in all: Great cast, great battles, great photography but the best of this movie is the masterful soundtrack, its truly the best soundtrack of any film ever and is unforgettable. The opening scene is epic. I love the movies, which their opening scenes has great music. Daniel Day-Lewis do a memorable performance, its impressive how he act, he has good vocabulary and his quotes are awesome. Michael Mann does a great job mixing romance and action. The most important thing about this movie is the final scene that is considered for me an epic and powerful scene, I can't describe what I feel when I hear the soundtrack at this scene, its simply epic. This movie was the first great job that Mann did, but Heat is his best movie. The movie won an academy award for best sound, but it didn't get the academy award for best soundtrack and is truly not fair, its unforgiven. An all-time classic that I watch three times each year.

    As a Daniel Day-Lewis fan, I really looked forward watching this movie. Having heard good critics about the film, I actually expected many things; electrifying performance by Day-Lewis, a nice cinematography and direction, strong side characters, impressive battles. However, after the film ended I found it hard to vote. The film wasn't bad at all. At some extend it did have what I expected, but in a lesser degree. None of the characters had a real depth and that lead to the actors to just perform 'alright'. Duncan and Magua were perhaps the most interesting characters of the story. The British officer was in love with a woman who never wanted him and even died for her, while the Huron warrior was driven by vengeance and it was revealed that his mind was closer to that of the 'White Man'. I also found the writing to be quite shallow. Most important of all, Hawkeye and Cora's romance felt flat - it felt like there was no chemistry between the two. And after all, there is almost no memorable quote from this film. Without a doubt, the soundtrack was the movie's only flawless part; magical.

    The Last of the Mohicans is the proper use of your Michael Mann. A good story mixed with good performances and top notch direction. This is well done action film with good story, good characters and perfect ending that will send chills up your spine. Michael Mann just got everything right when he made this film from the casting, the script and the direction. It's very well paced, superbly shot and leaves a strong impact after you have seen it. Unlike most films surrounding the American history, The Last of the Mohicans just wants to entertain you without beating you over the head with it's message. Also it doesn't hurt when you have one of the best actors in the last 20 years leading your film. Overall it's a very good film that understands how to tell a simple story that will please the general audience and won't insult your intelligence.

    Dark, boring, yellow-lensed version of the well-known story of the same name. Former NFL linebacker D.D. Lewis walks through this bad script; the direction isn't much better. Too many talky moments slow things down, but just when you're ready to go do something more interesting, like take out the garbage, another battle scene pops up -- yeah, that's what this movie needed! Some pop-ups or some really good spam to mix things up a little. Maybe the next time I'm watching this flick (that could happen), I'll get an email from the film-makers telling me how much they loved this movie review. Strictly by-the-numbers; D.D. Lewis quit the Dallas Cowboys for this?

    I've probably seen this three or four times now. I personally rate this as one of my all-time favorites. It is comparable to other great historical action/adventure movies like Braveheart and Gladiator, but what makes this better is the music. It is haunting but at the same time inspiring. The name of the theme song is The Gael and I could probably listen to it all day. There is little to complain about with this movie. Maybe the romantic part was a little bit forced. It seemed like it happened too quickly in my opinion. Also, Uncas and the younger sister should've had some more speaking lines.

    Sure I could trot off here a number of flaws, I suppose the same flaws that are generally levelled against the film. We have constructed history of a similar sort to what we complain about in Spielberg. We have simple dualities: nobility and barbarity, law and instinct, sin and redemption, and a lot of effort that goes to shuffle these so that each surfaces in the others, for instance so that the lawful English officer can be shown to be the opposite and noble again in the end. And Day-Lewis was not as interesting at this point, doing a role that DiCaprio could do now. But there's an intuitive horizon here that is worth bypassing all that stuff for. To get there we have to wait for the film to shift from the 'white' world of structured chaos to the 'indian' world of primeval urges. It's the same effect that Mann used in Manhunter, where again we had the shift from the detective-world of logic and narrative to the killer's world of visual urges and logic of a different, intuitive kind. The transition happens in a marvelous scene behind a waterfall, every element in that scene is great, the flickering shadows on cave walls, the concealment against flowing sheets of water, the jump and fall. Everything before that isn't of much interest to me, but past that point the film hits me in a similar way to Malick. Within this more conventionally fabricated story it may not register, but I find here the same ecstatic camera that I saw in New World, an attempt to sculpt in a different timeflow. The motions of falling bodies against the void, characters staring from afar at the moment of departure. It's good stuff that reminds me why I'm drawn to Mann much more than his peers.. He seems intuitively drawn to the notion that these emotional urges in moving us create stories, that all stories are more or less logical attempts to account for mysterious workings in the soul; he was most clear about this in Manhunter but he attempts to know it again in most of his films, even as he kids himself with the detective story. He didn't gamble here, you can experience this in the typical way. He did in Public Enemies but people balked. They wanted this, the conventionally fabricated history.

    Director Michael Mann brings violence, brutality, romance, and striking visuals to dusty old history. Maj Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) is bringing reinforcements to Ft. William Henry with Col Munro's daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) when they're betrayed by Magua (Wes Studi). Only the timely arrival of Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his two companions saved their lives. This is an old fashion epic infused with modern brutality and violence. I will not debate historical accuracy. That's beyond the point here. It's a romantic melodrama using some real events as backdrop. The action is powerfully done. The brutal violence is even more powerful due to the close quarters nature of the battles. There is no CG in this one. They're doing the real physical stuff.

    Am I missing something more here ? Missed this highly recommended mega flick during the 90's ,was rooting for it and finally got the directors cut on bluray .The movie experience was far below the expectations however !!! The story line is weak with "Injun" adopted white man instantly falling in love with English colonel's daughter being allowed so , even acknowledged publicly during the height of a colonial FrenchEnglish hate campaign , another of the colonel's kin falling in instantaneous love with the savage "Injun" boy , even instantly sacrificing the life for him by jumping off the cliff . Fluent French and English speaking red Indians , three men stalking the forest decimating every hoard of opponents ( of whatever number strength ) they meet everywhere , in the midst of a brutal Indian ambush on the retreating defeated English the clearly recognizable shirt sporting rival clan three Indians are allowed to dodge every bullet , club and tomahawk flung at them ... or do they have to ? everyone ... friend or foe alike seem to make way for them to facilitate escape with their chosen ones indeed totally unharmed !!! Daniel DeyLewis has done much better acting elsewhere .. nothing much that he can do to make the unconvincing violent spectacle more acceptable !! The musical score and photography were the only impressive features in this much hyped bloodshot 'epic' . Albeit the overdoing , the final mountain chase and individual decimation loop was the only gripping segment for me . On any day i would rate " The last Samurai " or even " Dances with wolves " way much higher than this movie rightfully discounted by the Oscar academy !!! Wait a minute ...was that a Bollywood reel that i was watching ?

    "The Last of the Mohicans" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of its time. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures with everyone being involved. This movie has a bit of action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and it appears that he has researched well into the James Fenimore Cooper's book on which the movie is based. The story is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters  Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice Munro (Jodhi May) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children. This is by far Mann's best film yet and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious. This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy; complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during that hectic time period. MY RATING: 9/10

The British officer was in love with a woman who never wanted him and even died for her, while the Huron warrior was driven by vengeance and it was revealed that his mind was closer to that of the 'White Man'. I also found the writing to be quite shallow. Most important of all, Hawkeye and Cora's romance felt flat - it felt like there was no chemistry between the two. And after all, there is almost no memorable quote from this film. Without a doubt, the soundtrack was the movie's only flawless part; magical.

    The Last of the Mohicans is the proper use of your Michael Mann. A good story mixed with good performances and top notch direction. This is well done action film with good story, good characters and perfect ending that will send chills up your spine. Michael Mann just got everything right when he made this film from the casting, the script and the direction. It's very well paced, superbly shot and leaves a strong impact after you have seen it. Unlike most films surrounding the American history, The Last of the Mohicans just wants to entertain you without beating you over the head with it's message. Also it doesn't hurt when you have one of the best actors in the last 20 years leading your film. Overall it's a very good film that understands how to tell a simple story that will please the general audience and won't insult your intelligence.

    Dark, boring, yellow-lensed version of the well-known story of the same name. Former NFL linebacker D.D. Lewis walks through this bad script; the direction isn't much better. Too many talky moments slow things down, but just when you're ready to go do something more interesting, like take out the garbage, another battle scene pops up -- yeah, that's what this movie needed! Some pop-ups or some really good spam to mix things up a little. Maybe the next time I'm watching this flick (that could happen), I'll get an email from the film-makers telling me how much they loved this movie review. Strictly by-the-numbers; D.D. Lewis quit the Dallas Cowboys for this?

    I've probably seen this three or four times now. I personally rate this as one of my all-time favorites. It is comparable to other great historical action/adventure movies like Braveheart and Gladiator, but what makes this better is the music. It is haunting but at the same time inspiring. The name of the theme song is The Gael and I could probably listen to it all day. There is little to complain about with this movie. Maybe the romantic part was a little bit forced. It seemed like it happened too quickly in my opinion. Also, Uncas and the younger sister should've had some more speaking lines.

    Sure I could trot off here a number of flaws, I suppose the same flaws that are generally levelled against the film. We have constructed history of a similar sort to what we complain about in Spielberg. We have simple dualities: nobility and barbarity, law and instinct, sin and redemption, and a lot of effort that goes to shuffle these so that each surfaces in the others, for instance so that the lawful English officer can be shown to be the opposite and noble again in the end. And Day-Lewis was not as interesting at this point, doing a role that DiCaprio could do now. But there's an intuitive horizon here that is worth bypassing all that stuff for. To get there we have to wait for the film to shift from the 'white' world of structured chaos to the 'indian' world of primeval urges. It's the same effect that Mann used in Manhunter, where again we had the shift from the detective-world of logic and narrative to the killer's world of visual urges and logic of a different, intuitive kind. The transition happens in a marvelous scene behind a waterfall, every element in that scene is great, the flickering shadows on cave walls, the concealment against flowing sheets of water, the jump and fall. Everything before that isn't of much interest to me, but past that point the film hits me in a similar way to Malick. Within this more conventionally fabricated story it may not register, but I find here the same ecstatic camera that I saw in New World, an attempt to sculpt in a different timeflow. The motions of falling bodies against the void, characters staring from afar at the moment of departure. It's good stuff that reminds me why I'm drawn to Mann much more than his peers.. He seems intuitively drawn to the notion that these emotional urges in moving us create stories, that all stories are more or less logical attempts to account for mysterious workings in the soul; he was most clear about this in Manhunter but he attempts to know it again in most of his films, even as he kids himself with the detective story. He didn't gamble here, you can experience this in the typical way. He did in Public Enemies but people balked. They wanted this, the conventionally fabricated history.

    Director Michael Mann brings violence, brutality, romance, and striking visuals to dusty old history. Maj Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) is bringing reinforcements to Ft. William Henry with Col Munro's daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) when they're betrayed by Magua (Wes Studi). Only the timely arrival of Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his two companions saved their lives. This is an old fashion epic infused with modern brutality and violence. I will not debate historical accuracy. That's beyond the point here. It's a romantic melodrama using some real events as backdrop. The action is powerfully done. The brutal violence is even more powerful due to the close quarters nature of the battles. There is no CG in this one. They're doing the real physical stuff.

    Am I missing something more here ? Missed this highly recommended mega flick during the 90's ,was rooting for it and finally got the directors cut on bluray .The movie experience was far below the expectations however !!! The story line is weak with "Injun" adopted white man instantly falling in love with English colonel's daughter being allowed so , even acknowledged publicly during the height of a colonial FrenchEnglish hate campaign , another of the colonel's kin falling in instantaneous love with the savage "Injun" boy , even instantly sacrificing the life for him by jumping off the cliff . Fluent French and English speaking red Indians , three men stalking the forest decimating every hoard of opponents ( of whatever number strength ) they meet everywhere , in the midst of a brutal Indian ambush on the retreating defeated English the clearly recognizable shirt sporting rival clan three Indians are allowed to dodge every bullet , club and tomahawk flung at them ... or do they have to ? everyone ... friend or foe alike seem to make way for them to facilitate escape with their chosen ones indeed totally unharmed !!! Daniel DeyLewis has done much better acting elsewhere .. nothing much that he can do to make the unconvincing violent spectacle more acceptable !! The musical score and photography were the only impressive features in this much hyped bloodshot 'epic' . Albeit the overdoing , the final mountain chase and individual decimation loop was the only gripping segment for me . On any day i would rate " The last Samurai " or even " Dances with wolves " way much higher than this movie rightfully discounted by the Oscar academy !!! Wait a minute ...was that a Bollywood reel that i was watching ?

    "The Last of the Mohicans" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of its time. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures with everyone being involved. This movie has a bit of action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and it appears that he has researched well into the James Fenimore Cooper's book on which the movie is based. The story is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters  Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice Munro (Jodhi May) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children. This is by far Mann's best film yet and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious. This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy; complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during that hectic time period. MY RATING: 9/10

    The Last of the Mohicans is a fantastic movie with a storyline that is really well developed and a very talented cast that all deliver very fine and strong performances.Obviously the best performance was from Daniel Day-Lewis,he is probably one of the greatest actors of all time,he is so believable and he puts so much heart into all of his performances.His performance as Hawkeye was truly breathtaking and i'm so shocked he didn't even get an Academy Award nomination,it definitely isn't his best performance,but it's really good.AI also really love the soundtrack to this movie,the music is so beautiful and it really suits the overall setting.My only problem really is that it wasn't long enough,it goes by so quickly and when it ends I felt like there could have been so much more,it was an hour and fifty minutes,but it feels much shorter.I strongly recommend this movie to all fans of Daniel Day Lewis and Michael Mann. During the war between Britain and France over America,three men must do all they can to keep a Colonel's daughter safe.

    The last of the Mohicans is for me an epic movie, the best adventure film ever made. Its a masterpiece in all: Great cast, great battles, great photography but the best of this movie is the masterful soundtrack, its truly the best soundtrack of any film ever and is unforgettable. The opening scene is epic. I love the movies, which their opening scenes has great music. Daniel Day-Lewis do a memorable performance, its impressive how he act, he has good vocabulary and his quotes are awesome. Michael Mann does a great job mixing romance and action. The most important thing about this movie is the final scene that is considered for me an epic and powerful scene, I can't describe what I feel when I hear the soundtrack at this scene, its simply epic. This movie was the first great job that Mann did, but Heat is his best movie. The movie won an academy award for best sound, but it didn't get the academy award for best soundtrack and is truly not fair, its unforgiven. An all-time classic that I watch three times each year.

    As a Daniel Day-Lewis fan, I really looked forward watching this movie. Having heard good critics about the film, I actually expected many things; electrifying performance by Day-Lewis, a nice cinematography and direction, strong side characters, impressive battles. However, after the film ended I found it hard to vote. The film wasn't bad at all. At some extend it did have what I expected, but in a lesser degree. None of the characters had a real depth and that lead to the actors to just perform 'alright'. Duncan and Magua were perhaps the most interesting characters of the story.
