 <sinopse>
  Lady avenger returns to western town owned by a ruthless gunslinger hosting an elimination tournament.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Ellen, an unknown female gunslinger rides into a small, dingy and depressing prairie town with a secret as to her reason for showing up. Shortly after her arrival, a local preacher, Cort, is thrown through the saloon doors while townfolk are signing up for a gun competition. The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule: that you follow the rules of the man that set up the contest, Herod. Herod is also the owner, leader, and "ruler" of the town. Seems he's arranged this little gun-show-off so that the preacher (who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod) will have to fight again. Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod, acknowledging Cort as one of the best, is determined to alter this line of thinking ... even if it gets someone killed ...

    Ellen (Sharon Stone) is a mysterious gunslinger who signs up for a gun draw competition. Herod (Gene Hackman) is the evil leader of the town who devise the competition to draw out all his would-be assassins. Cort (Russell Crowe) is a prisoner forced to fight again. Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the young buck looking to make a name for himself. Director Sam Raimi has made a pretty simple western movie. There is a bit of a backstory of Herod's history with Ellen. The only interesting thing is that the lead gunfighter is a woman. Sharon Stone really does her best to be Clint Eastwood for what it's worth. The style just isn't rough or gritty. It moves along just enough to be watchable.

    Â„The quick and the dead" has an impressive cast : Sharon Stone ("Basic instinct") , Gene Hackman ("The French connection") , Leonardo DiCaprio ("Titanic") , Russell Crowe ("Gladiator") , Lance Henriksen ("Aliens"), Pat Hingle ("Batman") , Tobin Bell ("Saw") , Gary Sinise ("Forrest Gump") and Keith David ("Armageddon"). From all the stars here the best are Hackman as the evil sheriff , Crowe as the priest and Henriksen as the shooter . The worst performance gives DiCaprio who is so F***ING ANNOYING , that you wish him dead . Stone is kinda unconvincing in the main role . She's too delicate , not too tough as the role requires. The movie suffers from the fact that it is too serious for it's own good and not too much fun as it wants to be. I think that the story they got here deserved a serious movie . Serious western . Unfortunately , Raimi decided to do a pastiche . It was a wrong move , because there isn't too much fun moments here . The movie lacks heart , despite some real potential . Raimi never allows the viewer to take his moment seriously , so all the serious moments are emotionally flat and wasted . In the end what we've got here is a unconvincing pastiche that isn't too much interesting . It's not a bad movie , but in other hands it could be a classic western movie. I give it 5/10.

    The Quick and the Dead is a good, if not a bit derivative western. It seems like this was one of the few westerns to come out in the 1990's due to the lack of popularity. This is a good shoot-em-up that has fun gun battles, great acting, impressive visual shots of the landscape, and smooth direction from Sam Raimi. Raimi's film is about a lone female rider who rides into the town of Redemption looking for some revenge. She takes part of a contest held by the sadistic man named Herod in order to make Herod pay for ruining her life. This film features some great acting. I believe it's been proved that Gene Hackman can do anything. This role reminds me of his famous role he had in Unforgiven. Sharon Stone is decent and pretty-looking. Russell Crowe is great as usual as the preacher and young Leo proves he has acting chops in his pre-Titanic days. Overall, this is a fine western even though it offers nothing new. The action is pretty good and there were even a few jokes that produced mild chuckles from me. This is a worthy addition to any Western collection out there. I rate this film 9/10.

    Even if viewed as a cartoonish interpretation of Westerns this picture splats to the lowest level of the genre. Preposterous plot and sluggish development of same (you can't make chicken salad out of chicken feed...), the direction seems mesmerized by Stone's undeniable good looks and Hackman's villainous mugging. Absent a convincing story line the plot resorts to endless shoot 'em-up sequences and a blown-to-smithereens ending that masquerades as a an inferno finale --notwhithstanding the fact that the explosion sequences alternate with shots that show little damage to the town's buildings and no casualties among the predictable melange of denizens. The sound track is absurd, climaxing at the end with Stone's steps along the dirt street resonating as if she were stomping on a granite floor, and the music, to put it kindly, mimics Ennio Morricone's early (and better) efforts. In sum: an eminently avoidable fiasco unless viewed as a tongue-in-cheek compendium of some of the worst clich&eacute;s of non- spaghetti Westerns.

    On paper, The Quick and the Dead sounds like just my kinda thing as I am a pretty big fan of both the Western genre and Raimi. He is a stylish director, using kinetic, frantic camera movements to both advance plot and visually please the audience. Unfortunately, here he completely drops the ball and is unable to string together the narrative of what is one of the most basic and re-told stories in American movies. Sharon Stone is the lone gunslinger who wanders into town with an apparent grudge against its' head gangster, Gene Hackman. Hackman chews the scenery like he is back on the set of Superman and is clearly having a blast, Stone on the other hand is so woefully miscast that it is just embarrassing. She never for a moment convinces us that she is anything more than a Hollywood princess playing dress up and when she has to square up to Hackman it is like watching a teenager throw a temper tantrum. Stone doesn't realise the director thinks he is making a comedy, which is something she probably should have cleared up with him as she, in her role as producer, hired him. Russell Crowe is underwhelming as the bad guy turned good and he can't hide that Ozzie accent. Leonardo DiCaprio rounds out the key players and he is fine as the young brash wannabe legend, showing that movie star charisma and handsome smile that would define him for a generation of teenage girls a few years later. He is also responsible for the films only real moment of humanity. Lance Henriksen, Woody Strode and Mark Boone Junior are among the supporting players who fail to make any kind of impact due to the lousy script and direction so flimsy the film seems to lunge from one scene to the next with no sense of purpose or vision. The plot revolves around a shooting competition in which the contestants 'draw' on each other upon the strike of the clock tower bell. This gives Raimi plenty of opportunity to showcase some unusual and potentially exciting visuals but he is unable to inject any tension into the proceedings. Leone can make us feel the tension even when we know the outcome, whereas when watching The Quick and the Dead I found myself with one eye on the clock like one of the characters in the movie. Lastly, I'll mention Alan Silvestri's score, which is routine and dull. That comment could review the whole film.

    After reading all the glowing reviews on this massive pile of cinematic garbage, I realize why people actually think that the food at MacDonald's is delicious or why "Gator Boys" should win an Emmy. Watching this picture wasn't simply awful, it was painful. It wasn't an exciting western, it was horse excrement. First, a dumb blonde as the fastest gun in the west is stretching the limits of my imagination to the limit, and beyond. Sharon Stone in chaps just doesn't pass muster. Wasn't Tory Spelling available? The "plot," if you'd care to call it one, goes sharply downhill from there, dressing up top Hollywood talent at Western Costume like comedy buffoons, mindlessly shooting one another down like clowns at the Barnum and Bailey Circus. This wasn't a serious ode to Spaghetti Westerns, or any other respectable or legitimate genreÂ—it was an superficial ode to Hollywood formula gone terribly, terribly wrong. No amount of Western clich&eacute;s or action sequences could save this monumental turkey from itself. This isn't a movie, it's a cartoon. "The Quick and the Dead" is Dead on Arrival.

    Just as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven signals a sort of closure to the idea of violence as a solution in the Old West, this straight-faced parody of the spaghetti western revels in the myth and sends it up with great verve; where most films move inexorably to the final shoot-out down the main street, this film features one "final" shoot-out after another; Gene Hackman is not just the bad guy--he plays evil to the hilt, just as Di Caprio sends up the Billy The Kid image with cocky bravado; the star, Sharon Stone, has a fine time being the gutsy woman in a town jammed with testosterone, shooting it out with the best of them. Raimi's film is an utter delight for those who appreciate a heavy injection of satire with the traditional action film; it's never dull, but impressive with action set pieces, impressive staging and brilliant color.

    Sharon Stone rides into town as a really tough lady, cigar-smoking and eager to prove that she is adept with the gun. The town is run by villain Gene Hackman. He controls practically everything, and he is currently have a contest to see who can shoot each other in the fastest way possible. All sorts of characters enter the contest, Leonardo De Caprio, one of them. He claims that Hackman is his father. Russell Crowe plays a former outlaw, who got religion and is now forced by Hackman and his group to participate in the shooting. To me, the picture is a typical shoot them up western. The bodies begin to pile up as we finally learn that Stone is there for vengeance. Stone is adept at the part, but I can imagine Jane Russell in her youth doing this role.

It has heart,it has soul,it has gratuitous violence...are you kidding me here?The scenery around Tuscon can't be left out of a description of this flick.The background of the islands in the sky are ever present.I love this movie and it should get more cred.A modern day moral for us all!

    Now I enjoy western movies and although this doesn't have that traditional western vibe going for it, it's still pretty darn entertaining. This movie is like watching a comic book western movie come to life and although the plot is a bit absurd it's creative and has substance to it. Despite the it going in a narrow direction but it goes in a narrow direction with at least some substance. The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past. Overall I enjoyed this movie, not one of the best western I seen but it's a pretty cool one. 7.8/10

    Ellen (Sharon Stone) is a mysterious gunslinger who signs up for a gun draw competition. Herod (Gene Hackman) is the evil leader of the town who devise the competition to draw out all his would-be assassins. Cort (Russell Crowe) is a prisoner forced to fight again. Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the young buck looking to make a name for himself. Director Sam Raimi has made a pretty simple western movie. There is a bit of a backstory of Herod's history with Ellen. The only interesting thing is that the lead gunfighter is a woman. Sharon Stone really does her best to be Clint Eastwood for what it's worth. The style just isn't rough or gritty. It moves along just enough to be watchable.

    Â„The quick and the dead" has an impressive cast : Sharon Stone ("Basic instinct") , Gene Hackman ("The French connection") , Leonardo DiCaprio ("Titanic") , Russell Crowe ("Gladiator") , Lance Henriksen ("Aliens"), Pat Hingle ("Batman") , Tobin Bell ("Saw") , Gary Sinise ("Forrest Gump") and Keith David ("Armageddon"). From all the stars here the best are Hackman as the evil sheriff , Crowe as the priest and Henriksen as the shooter . The worst performance gives DiCaprio who is so F***ING ANNOYING , that you wish him dead . Stone is kinda unconvincing in the main role . She's too delicate , not too tough as the role requires. The movie suffers from the fact that it is too serious for it's own good and not too much fun as it wants to be. I think that the story they got here deserved a serious movie . Serious western . Unfortunately , Raimi decided to do a pastiche . It was a wrong move , because there isn't too much fun moments here . The movie lacks heart , despite some real potential . Raimi never allows the viewer to take his moment seriously , so all the serious moments are emotionally flat and wasted . In the end what we've got here is a unconvincing pastiche that isn't too much interesting . It's not a bad movie , but in other hands it could be a classic western movie. I give it 5/10.

    The Quick and the Dead is a good, if not a bit derivative western. It seems like this was one of the few westerns to come out in the 1990's due to the lack of popularity. This is a good shoot-em-up that has fun gun battles, great acting, impressive visual shots of the landscape, and smooth direction from Sam Raimi. Raimi's film is about a lone female rider who rides into the town of Redemption looking for some revenge. She takes part of a contest held by the sadistic man named Herod in order to make Herod pay for ruining her life. This film features some great acting. I believe it's been proved that Gene Hackman can do anything. This role reminds me of his famous role he had in Unforgiven. Sharon Stone is decent and pretty-looking. Russell Crowe is great as usual as the preacher and young Leo proves he has acting chops in his pre-Titanic days. Overall, this is a fine western even though it offers nothing new. The action is pretty good and there were even a few jokes that produced mild chuckles from me. This is a worthy addition to any Western collection out there. I rate this film 9/10.

    Even if viewed as a cartoonish interpretation of Westerns this picture splats to the lowest level of the genre. Preposterous plot and sluggish development of same (you can't make chicken salad out of chicken feed...), the direction seems mesmerized by Stone's undeniable good looks and Hackman's villainous mugging. Absent a convincing story line the plot resorts to endless shoot 'em-up sequences and a blown-to-smithereens ending that masquerades as a an inferno finale --notwhithstanding the fact that the explosion sequences alternate with shots that show little damage to the town's buildings and no casualties among the predictable melange of denizens. The sound track is absurd, climaxing at the end with Stone's steps along the dirt street resonating as if she were stomping on a granite floor, and the music, to put it kindly, mimics Ennio Morricone's early (and better) efforts. In sum: an eminently avoidable fiasco unless viewed as a tongue-in-cheek compendium of some of the worst clich&eacute;s of non- spaghetti Westerns.

    On paper, The Quick and the Dead sounds like just my kinda thing as I am a pretty big fan of both the Western genre and Raimi. He is a stylish director, using kinetic, frantic camera movements to both advance plot and visually please the audience. Unfortunately, here he completely drops the ball and is unable to string together the narrative of what is one of the most basic and re-told stories in American movies. Sharon Stone is the lone gunslinger who wanders into town with an apparent grudge against its' head gangster, Gene Hackman. Hackman chews the scenery like he is back on the set of Superman and is clearly having a blast, Stone on the other hand is so woefully miscast that it is just embarrassing. She never for a moment convinces us that she is anything more than a Hollywood princess playing dress up and when she has to square up to Hackman it is like watching a teenager throw a temper tantrum. Stone doesn't realise the director thinks he is making a comedy, which is something she probably should have cleared up with him as she, in her role as producer, hired him. Russell Crowe is underwhelming as the bad guy turned good and he can't hide that Ozzie accent. Leonardo DiCaprio rounds out the key players and he is fine as the young brash wannabe legend, showing that movie star charisma and handsome smile that would define him for a generation of teenage girls a few years later. He is also responsible for the films only real moment of humanity. Lance Henriksen, Woody Strode and Mark Boone Junior are among the supporting players who fail to make any kind of impact due to the lousy script and direction so flimsy the film seems to lunge from one scene to the next with no sense of purpose or vision. The plot revolves around a shooting competition in which the contestants 'draw' on each other upon the strike of the clock tower bell. This gives Raimi plenty of opportunity to showcase some unusual and potentially exciting visuals but he is unable to inject any tension into the proceedings. Leone can make us feel the tension even when we know the outcome, whereas when watching The Quick and the Dead I found myself with one eye on the clock like one of the characters in the movie. Lastly, I'll mention Alan Silvestri's score, which is routine and dull. That comment could review the whole film.

    After reading all the glowing reviews on this massive pile of cinematic garbage, I realize why people actually think that the food at MacDonald's is delicious or why "Gator Boys" should win an Emmy. Watching this picture wasn't simply awful, it was painful. It wasn't an exciting western, it was horse excrement. First, a dumb blonde as the fastest gun in the west is stretching the limits of my imagination to the limit, and beyond. Sharon Stone in chaps just doesn't pass muster. Wasn't Tory Spelling available? The "plot," if you'd care to call it one, goes sharply downhill from there, dressing up top Hollywood talent at Western Costume like comedy buffoons, mindlessly shooting one another down like clowns at the Barnum and Bailey Circus. This wasn't a serious ode to Spaghetti Westerns, or any other respectable or legitimate genreÂ—it was an superficial ode to Hollywood formula gone terribly, terribly wrong. No amount of Western clich&eacute;s or action sequences could save this monumental turkey from itself. This isn't a movie, it's a cartoon. "The Quick and the Dead" is Dead on Arrival.

    Just as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven signals a sort of closure to the idea of violence as a solution in the Old West, this straight-faced parody of the spaghetti western revels in the myth and sends it up with great verve; where most films move inexorably to the final shoot-out down the main street, this film features one "final" shoot-out after another; Gene Hackman is not just the bad guy--he plays evil to the hilt, just as Di Caprio sends up the Billy The Kid image with cocky bravado; the star, Sharon Stone, has a fine time being the gutsy woman in a town jammed with testosterone, shooting it out with the best of them. Raimi's film is an utter delight for those who appreciate a heavy injection of satire with the traditional action film; it's never dull, but impressive with action set pieces, impressive staging and brilliant color.

    Sharon Stone rides into town as a really tough lady, cigar-smoking and eager to prove that she is adept with the gun. The town is run by villain Gene Hackman. He controls practically everything, and he is currently have a contest to see who can shoot each other in the fastest way possible. All sorts of characters enter the contest, Leonardo De Caprio, one of them. He claims that Hackman is his father. Russell Crowe plays a former outlaw, who got religion and is now forced by Hackman and his group to participate in the shooting. To me, the picture is a typical shoot them up western. The bodies begin to pile up as we finally learn that Stone is there for vengeance. Stone is adept at the part, but I can imagine Jane Russell in her youth doing this role.

    This movie has stood the test of time.I don't care what anyone says,I will watch this over and over.I am a Sam Raimi fan and this does not disappoint.I wasn't a Sharon Stone fan and not a Leo fan before this film but they are great and I say they both went on to greatness.The unknown(at the time)Russell Crowe is great.Gene muthafreakin' Hackman is the total best baddie.What else can one ask for in a modern day Western? It has heart,it has soul,it has gratuitous violence...are you kidding me here?The scenery around Tuscon can't be left out of a description of this flick.The background of the islands in the sky are ever present.I love this movie and it should get more cred.A modern day moral for us all!

    Now I enjoy western movies and although this doesn't have that traditional western vibe going for it, it's still pretty darn entertaining. This movie is like watching a comic book western movie come to life and although the plot is a bit absurd it's creative and has substance to it. Despite the it going in a narrow direction but it goes in a narrow direction with at least some substance. The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past. Overall I enjoyed this movie, not one of the best western I seen but it's a pretty cool one. 7.8/10

Raimi never allows the viewer to take his moment seriously , so all the serious moments are emotionally flat and wasted . In the end what we've got here is a unconvincing pastiche that isn't too much interesting . It's not a bad movie , but in other hands it could be a classic western movie. I give it 5/10.

    The Quick and the Dead is a good, if not a bit derivative western. It seems like this was one of the few westerns to come out in the 1990's due to the lack of popularity. This is a good shoot-em-up that has fun gun battles, great acting, impressive visual shots of the landscape, and smooth direction from Sam Raimi. Raimi's film is about a lone female rider who rides into the town of Redemption looking for some revenge. She takes part of a contest held by the sadistic man named Herod in order to make Herod pay for ruining her life. This film features some great acting. I believe it's been proved that Gene Hackman can do anything. This role reminds me of his famous role he had in Unforgiven. Sharon Stone is decent and pretty-looking. Russell Crowe is great as usual as the preacher and young Leo proves he has acting chops in his pre-Titanic days. Overall, this is a fine western even though it offers nothing new. The action is pretty good and there were even a few jokes that produced mild chuckles from me. This is a worthy addition to any Western collection out there. I rate this film 9/10.

    Even if viewed as a cartoonish interpretation of Westerns this picture splats to the lowest level of the genre. Preposterous plot and sluggish development of same (you can't make chicken salad out of chicken feed...), the direction seems mesmerized by Stone's undeniable good looks and Hackman's villainous mugging. Absent a convincing story line the plot resorts to endless shoot 'em-up sequences and a blown-to-smithereens ending that masquerades as a an inferno finale --notwhithstanding the fact that the explosion sequences alternate with shots that show little damage to the town's buildings and no casualties among the predictable melange of denizens. The sound track is absurd, climaxing at the end with Stone's steps along the dirt street resonating as if she were stomping on a granite floor, and the music, to put it kindly, mimics Ennio Morricone's early (and better) efforts. In sum: an eminently avoidable fiasco unless viewed as a tongue-in-cheek compendium of some of the worst clich&eacute;s of non- spaghetti Westerns.

    On paper, The Quick and the Dead sounds like just my kinda thing as I am a pretty big fan of both the Western genre and Raimi. He is a stylish director, using kinetic, frantic camera movements to both advance plot and visually please the audience. Unfortunately, here he completely drops the ball and is unable to string together the narrative of what is one of the most basic and re-told stories in American movies. Sharon Stone is the lone gunslinger who wanders into town with an apparent grudge against its' head gangster, Gene Hackman. Hackman chews the scenery like he is back on the set of Superman and is clearly having a blast, Stone on the other hand is so woefully miscast that it is just embarrassing. She never for a moment convinces us that she is anything more than a Hollywood princess playing dress up and when she has to square up to Hackman it is like watching a teenager throw a temper tantrum. Stone doesn't realise the director thinks he is making a comedy, which is something she probably should have cleared up with him as she, in her role as producer, hired him. Russell Crowe is underwhelming as the bad guy turned good and he can't hide that Ozzie accent. Leonardo DiCaprio rounds out the key players and he is fine as the young brash wannabe legend, showing that movie star charisma and handsome smile that would define him for a generation of teenage girls a few years later. He is also responsible for the films only real moment of humanity. Lance Henriksen, Woody Strode and Mark Boone Junior are among the supporting players who fail to make any kind of impact due to the lousy script and direction so flimsy the film seems to lunge from one scene to the next with no sense of purpose or vision. The plot revolves around a shooting competition in which the contestants 'draw' on each other upon the strike of the clock tower bell. This gives Raimi plenty of opportunity to showcase some unusual and potentially exciting visuals but he is unable to inject any tension into the proceedings. Leone can make us feel the tension even when we know the outcome, whereas when watching The Quick and the Dead I found myself with one eye on the clock like one of the characters in the movie. Lastly, I'll mention Alan Silvestri's score, which is routine and dull. That comment could review the whole film.

    After reading all the glowing reviews on this massive pile of cinematic garbage, I realize why people actually think that the food at MacDonald's is delicious or why "Gator Boys" should win an Emmy. Watching this picture wasn't simply awful, it was painful. It wasn't an exciting western, it was horse excrement. First, a dumb blonde as the fastest gun in the west is stretching the limits of my imagination to the limit, and beyond. Sharon Stone in chaps just doesn't pass muster. Wasn't Tory Spelling available? The "plot," if you'd care to call it one, goes sharply downhill from there, dressing up top Hollywood talent at Western Costume like comedy buffoons, mindlessly shooting one another down like clowns at the Barnum and Bailey Circus. This wasn't a serious ode to Spaghetti Westerns, or any other respectable or legitimate genreÂ—it was an superficial ode to Hollywood formula gone terribly, terribly wrong. No amount of Western clich&eacute;s or action sequences could save this monumental turkey from itself. This isn't a movie, it's a cartoon. "The Quick and the Dead" is Dead on Arrival.

    Just as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven signals a sort of closure to the idea of violence as a solution in the Old West, this straight-faced parody of the spaghetti western revels in the myth and sends it up with great verve; where most films move inexorably to the final shoot-out down the main street, this film features one "final" shoot-out after another; Gene Hackman is not just the bad guy--he plays evil to the hilt, just as Di Caprio sends up the Billy The Kid image with cocky bravado; the star, Sharon Stone, has a fine time being the gutsy woman in a town jammed with testosterone, shooting it out with the best of them. Raimi's film is an utter delight for those who appreciate a heavy injection of satire with the traditional action film; it's never dull, but impressive with action set pieces, impressive staging and brilliant color.

    Sharon Stone rides into town as a really tough lady, cigar-smoking and eager to prove that she is adept with the gun. The town is run by villain Gene Hackman. He controls practically everything, and he is currently have a contest to see who can shoot each other in the fastest way possible. All sorts of characters enter the contest, Leonardo De Caprio, one of them. He claims that Hackman is his father. Russell Crowe plays a former outlaw, who got religion and is now forced by Hackman and his group to participate in the shooting. To me, the picture is a typical shoot them up western. The bodies begin to pile up as we finally learn that Stone is there for vengeance. Stone is adept at the part, but I can imagine Jane Russell in her youth doing this role.

    This movie has stood the test of time.I don't care what anyone says,I will watch this over and over.I am a Sam Raimi fan and this does not disappoint.I wasn't a Sharon Stone fan and not a Leo fan before this film but they are great and I say they both went on to greatness.The unknown(at the time)Russell Crowe is great.Gene muthafreakin' Hackman is the total best baddie.What else can one ask for in a modern day Western? It has heart,it has soul,it has gratuitous violence...are you kidding me here?The scenery around Tuscon can't be left out of a description of this flick.The background of the islands in the sky are ever present.I love this movie and it should get more cred.A modern day moral for us all!

    Now I enjoy western movies and although this doesn't have that traditional western vibe going for it, it's still pretty darn entertaining. This movie is like watching a comic book western movie come to life and although the plot is a bit absurd it's creative and has substance to it. Despite the it going in a narrow direction but it goes in a narrow direction with at least some substance. The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past. Overall I enjoyed this movie, not one of the best western I seen but it's a pretty cool one. 7.8/10

    Ellen (Sharon Stone) is a mysterious gunslinger who signs up for a gun draw competition. Herod (Gene Hackman) is the evil leader of the town who devise the competition to draw out all his would-be assassins. Cort (Russell Crowe) is a prisoner forced to fight again. Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the young buck looking to make a name for himself. Director Sam Raimi has made a pretty simple western movie. There is a bit of a backstory of Herod's history with Ellen. The only interesting thing is that the lead gunfighter is a woman. Sharon Stone really does her best to be Clint Eastwood for what it's worth. The style just isn't rough or gritty. It moves along just enough to be watchable.

    Â„The quick and the dead" has an impressive cast : Sharon Stone ("Basic instinct") , Gene Hackman ("The French connection") , Leonardo DiCaprio ("Titanic") , Russell Crowe ("Gladiator") , Lance Henriksen ("Aliens"), Pat Hingle ("Batman") , Tobin Bell ("Saw") , Gary Sinise ("Forrest Gump") and Keith David ("Armageddon"). From all the stars here the best are Hackman as the evil sheriff , Crowe as the priest and Henriksen as the shooter . The worst performance gives DiCaprio who is so F***ING ANNOYING , that you wish him dead . Stone is kinda unconvincing in the main role . She's too delicate , not too tough as the role requires. The movie suffers from the fact that it is too serious for it's own good and not too much fun as it wants to be. I think that the story they got here deserved a serious movie . Serious western . Unfortunately , Raimi decided to do a pastiche . It was a wrong move , because there isn't too much fun moments here . The movie lacks heart , despite some real potential .

    Even if viewed as a cartoonish interpretation of Westerns this picture splats to the lowest level of the genre. Preposterous plot and sluggish development of same (you can't make chicken salad out of chicken feed...), the direction seems mesmerized by Stone's undeniable good looks and Hackman's villainous mugging. Absent a convincing story line the plot resorts to endless shoot 'em-up sequences and a blown-to-smithereens ending that masquerades as a an inferno finale --notwhithstanding the fact that the explosion sequences alternate with shots that show little damage to the town's buildings and no casualties among the predictable melange of denizens. The sound track is absurd, climaxing at the end with Stone's steps along the dirt street resonating as if she were stomping on a granite floor, and the music, to put it kindly, mimics Ennio Morricone's early (and better) efforts. In sum: an eminently avoidable fiasco unless viewed as a tongue-in-cheek compendium of some of the worst clich&eacute;s of non- spaghetti Westerns.

    On paper, The Quick and the Dead sounds like just my kinda thing as I am a pretty big fan of both the Western genre and Raimi. He is a stylish director, using kinetic, frantic camera movements to both advance plot and visually please the audience. Unfortunately, here he completely drops the ball and is unable to string together the narrative of what is one of the most basic and re-told stories in American movies. Sharon Stone is the lone gunslinger who wanders into town with an apparent grudge against its' head gangster, Gene Hackman. Hackman chews the scenery like he is back on the set of Superman and is clearly having a blast, Stone on the other hand is so woefully miscast that it is just embarrassing. She never for a moment convinces us that she is anything more than a Hollywood princess playing dress up and when she has to square up to Hackman it is like watching a teenager throw a temper tantrum. Stone doesn't realise the director thinks he is making a comedy, which is something she probably should have cleared up with him as she, in her role as producer, hired him. Russell Crowe is underwhelming as the bad guy turned good and he can't hide that Ozzie accent. Leonardo DiCaprio rounds out the key players and he is fine as the young brash wannabe legend, showing that movie star charisma and handsome smile that would define him for a generation of teenage girls a few years later. He is also responsible for the films only real moment of humanity. Lance Henriksen, Woody Strode and Mark Boone Junior are among the supporting players who fail to make any kind of impact due to the lousy script and direction so flimsy the film seems to lunge from one scene to the next with no sense of purpose or vision. The plot revolves around a shooting competition in which the contestants 'draw' on each other upon the strike of the clock tower bell. This gives Raimi plenty of opportunity to showcase some unusual and potentially exciting visuals but he is unable to inject any tension into the proceedings. Leone can make us feel the tension even when we know the outcome, whereas when watching The Quick and the Dead I found myself with one eye on the clock like one of the characters in the movie. Lastly, I'll mention Alan Silvestri's score, which is routine and dull. That comment could review the whole film.

    After reading all the glowing reviews on this massive pile of cinematic garbage, I realize why people actually think that the food at MacDonald's is delicious or why "Gator Boys" should win an Emmy. Watching this picture wasn't simply awful, it was painful. It wasn't an exciting western, it was horse excrement. First, a dumb blonde as the fastest gun in the west is stretching the limits of my imagination to the limit, and beyond. Sharon Stone in chaps just doesn't pass muster. Wasn't Tory Spelling available? The "plot," if you'd care to call it one, goes sharply downhill from there, dressing up top Hollywood talent at Western Costume like comedy buffoons, mindlessly shooting one another down like clowns at the Barnum and Bailey Circus. This wasn't a serious ode to Spaghetti Westerns, or any other respectable or legitimate genreÂ—it was an superficial ode to Hollywood formula gone terribly, terribly wrong. No amount of Western clich&eacute;s or action sequences could save this monumental turkey from itself. This isn't a movie, it's a cartoon. "The Quick and the Dead" is Dead on Arrival.

    Just as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven signals a sort of closure to the idea of violence as a solution in the Old West, this straight-faced parody of the spaghetti western revels in the myth and sends it up with great verve; where most films move inexorably to the final shoot-out down the main street, this film features one "final" shoot-out after another; Gene Hackman is not just the bad guy--he plays evil to the hilt, just as Di Caprio sends up the Billy The Kid image with cocky bravado; the star, Sharon Stone, has a fine time being the gutsy woman in a town jammed with testosterone, shooting it out with the best of them. Raimi's film is an utter delight for those who appreciate a heavy injection of satire with the traditional action film; it's never dull, but impressive with action set pieces, impressive staging and brilliant color.

    Sharon Stone rides into town as a really tough lady, cigar-smoking and eager to prove that she is adept with the gun. The town is run by villain Gene Hackman. He controls practically everything, and he is currently have a contest to see who can shoot each other in the fastest way possible. All sorts of characters enter the contest, Leonardo De Caprio, one of them. He claims that Hackman is his father. Russell Crowe plays a former outlaw, who got religion and is now forced by Hackman and his group to participate in the shooting. To me, the picture is a typical shoot them up western. The bodies begin to pile up as we finally learn that Stone is there for vengeance. Stone is adept at the part, but I can imagine Jane Russell in her youth doing this role.

    This movie has stood the test of time.I don't care what anyone says,I will watch this over and over.I am a Sam Raimi fan and this does not disappoint.I wasn't a Sharon Stone fan and not a Leo fan before this film but they are great and I say they both went on to greatness.The unknown(at the time)Russell Crowe is great.Gene muthafreakin' Hackman is the total best baddie.What else can one ask for in a modern day Western? It has heart,it has soul,it has gratuitous violence...are you kidding me here?The scenery around Tuscon can't be left out of a description of this flick.The background of the islands in the sky are ever present.I love this movie and it should get more cred.A modern day moral for us all!

    Now I enjoy western movies and although this doesn't have that traditional western vibe going for it, it's still pretty darn entertaining. This movie is like watching a comic book western movie come to life and although the plot is a bit absurd it's creative and has substance to it. Despite the it going in a narrow direction but it goes in a narrow direction with at least some substance. The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past. Overall I enjoyed this movie, not one of the best western I seen but it's a pretty cool one. 7.8/10

    Ellen (Sharon Stone) is a mysterious gunslinger who signs up for a gun draw competition. Herod (Gene Hackman) is the evil leader of the town who devise the competition to draw out all his would-be assassins. Cort (Russell Crowe) is a prisoner forced to fight again. Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the young buck looking to make a name for himself. Director Sam Raimi has made a pretty simple western movie. There is a bit of a backstory of Herod's history with Ellen. The only interesting thing is that the lead gunfighter is a woman. Sharon Stone really does her best to be Clint Eastwood for what it's worth. The style just isn't rough or gritty. It moves along just enough to be watchable.

    Â„The quick and the dead" has an impressive cast : Sharon Stone ("Basic instinct") , Gene Hackman ("The French connection") , Leonardo DiCaprio ("Titanic") , Russell Crowe ("Gladiator") , Lance Henriksen ("Aliens"), Pat Hingle ("Batman") , Tobin Bell ("Saw") , Gary Sinise ("Forrest Gump") and Keith David ("Armageddon"). From all the stars here the best are Hackman as the evil sheriff , Crowe as the priest and Henriksen as the shooter . The worst performance gives DiCaprio who is so F***ING ANNOYING , that you wish him dead . Stone is kinda unconvincing in the main role . She's too delicate , not too tough as the role requires. The movie suffers from the fact that it is too serious for it's own good and not too much fun as it wants to be. I think that the story they got here deserved a serious movie . Serious western . Unfortunately , Raimi decided to do a pastiche . It was a wrong move , because there isn't too much fun moments here . The movie lacks heart , despite some real potential . Raimi never allows the viewer to take his moment seriously , so all the serious moments are emotionally flat and wasted . In the end what we've got here is a unconvincing pastiche that isn't too much interesting . It's not a bad movie , but in other hands it could be a classic western movie. I give it 5/10.

    The Quick and the Dead is a good, if not a bit derivative western. It seems like this was one of the few westerns to come out in the 1990's due to the lack of popularity. This is a good shoot-em-up that has fun gun battles, great acting, impressive visual shots of the landscape, and smooth direction from Sam Raimi. Raimi's film is about a lone female rider who rides into the town of Redemption looking for some revenge. She takes part of a contest held by the sadistic man named Herod in order to make Herod pay for ruining her life. This film features some great acting. I believe it's been proved that Gene Hackman can do anything. This role reminds me of his famous role he had in Unforgiven. Sharon Stone is decent and pretty-looking. Russell Crowe is great as usual as the preacher and young Leo proves he has acting chops in his pre-Titanic days. Overall, this is a fine western even though it offers nothing new. The action is pretty good and there were even a few jokes that produced mild chuckles from me. This is a worthy addition to any Western collection out there. I rate this film 9/10.

Russell Crowe is underwhelming as the bad guy turned good and he can't hide that Ozzie accent. Leonardo DiCaprio rounds out the key players and he is fine as the young brash wannabe legend, showing that movie star charisma and handsome smile that would define him for a generation of teenage girls a few years later. He is also responsible for the films only real moment of humanity. Lance Henriksen, Woody Strode and Mark Boone Junior are among the supporting players who fail to make any kind of impact due to the lousy script and direction so flimsy the film seems to lunge from one scene to the next with no sense of purpose or vision. The plot revolves around a shooting competition in which the contestants 'draw' on each other upon the strike of the clock tower bell. This gives Raimi plenty of opportunity to showcase some unusual and potentially exciting visuals but he is unable to inject any tension into the proceedings. Leone can make us feel the tension even when we know the outcome, whereas when watching The Quick and the Dead I found myself with one eye on the clock like one of the characters in the movie. Lastly, I'll mention Alan Silvestri's score, which is routine and dull. That comment could review the whole film.

    After reading all the glowing reviews on this massive pile of cinematic garbage, I realize why people actually think that the food at MacDonald's is delicious or why "Gator Boys" should win an Emmy. Watching this picture wasn't simply awful, it was painful. It wasn't an exciting western, it was horse excrement. First, a dumb blonde as the fastest gun in the west is stretching the limits of my imagination to the limit, and beyond. Sharon Stone in chaps just doesn't pass muster. Wasn't Tory Spelling available? The "plot," if you'd care to call it one, goes sharply downhill from there, dressing up top Hollywood talent at Western Costume like comedy buffoons, mindlessly shooting one another down like clowns at the Barnum and Bailey Circus. This wasn't a serious ode to Spaghetti Westerns, or any other respectable or legitimate genreÂ—it was an superficial ode to Hollywood formula gone terribly, terribly wrong. No amount of Western clich&eacute;s or action sequences could save this monumental turkey from itself. This isn't a movie, it's a cartoon. "The Quick and the Dead" is Dead on Arrival.

    Just as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven signals a sort of closure to the idea of violence as a solution in the Old West, this straight-faced parody of the spaghetti western revels in the myth and sends it up with great verve; where most films move inexorably to the final shoot-out down the main street, this film features one "final" shoot-out after another; Gene Hackman is not just the bad guy--he plays evil to the hilt, just as Di Caprio sends up the Billy The Kid image with cocky bravado; the star, Sharon Stone, has a fine time being the gutsy woman in a town jammed with testosterone, shooting it out with the best of them. Raimi's film is an utter delight for those who appreciate a heavy injection of satire with the traditional action film; it's never dull, but impressive with action set pieces, impressive staging and brilliant color.

    Sharon Stone rides into town as a really tough lady, cigar-smoking and eager to prove that she is adept with the gun. The town is run by villain Gene Hackman. He controls practically everything, and he is currently have a contest to see who can shoot each other in the fastest way possible. All sorts of characters enter the contest, Leonardo De Caprio, one of them. He claims that Hackman is his father. Russell Crowe plays a former outlaw, who got religion and is now forced by Hackman and his group to participate in the shooting. To me, the picture is a typical shoot them up western. The bodies begin to pile up as we finally learn that Stone is there for vengeance. Stone is adept at the part, but I can imagine Jane Russell in her youth doing this role.

    This movie has stood the test of time.I don't care what anyone says,I will watch this over and over.I am a Sam Raimi fan and this does not disappoint.I wasn't a Sharon Stone fan and not a Leo fan before this film but they are great and I say they both went on to greatness.The unknown(at the time)Russell Crowe is great.Gene muthafreakin' Hackman is the total best baddie.What else can one ask for in a modern day Western? It has heart,it has soul,it has gratuitous violence...are you kidding me here?The scenery around Tuscon can't be left out of a description of this flick.The background of the islands in the sky are ever present.I love this movie and it should get more cred.A modern day moral for us all!

    Now I enjoy western movies and although this doesn't have that traditional western vibe going for it, it's still pretty darn entertaining. This movie is like watching a comic book western movie come to life and although the plot is a bit absurd it's creative and has substance to it. Despite the it going in a narrow direction but it goes in a narrow direction with at least some substance. The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past. Overall I enjoyed this movie, not one of the best western I seen but it's a pretty cool one. 7.8/10

    Ellen (Sharon Stone) is a mysterious gunslinger who signs up for a gun draw competition. Herod (Gene Hackman) is the evil leader of the town who devise the competition to draw out all his would-be assassins. Cort (Russell Crowe) is a prisoner forced to fight again. Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the young buck looking to make a name for himself. Director Sam Raimi has made a pretty simple western movie. There is a bit of a backstory of Herod's history with Ellen. The only interesting thing is that the lead gunfighter is a woman. Sharon Stone really does her best to be Clint Eastwood for what it's worth. The style just isn't rough or gritty. It moves along just enough to be watchable.

    Â„The quick and the dead" has an impressive cast : Sharon Stone ("Basic instinct") , Gene Hackman ("The French connection") , Leonardo DiCaprio ("Titanic") , Russell Crowe ("Gladiator") , Lance Henriksen ("Aliens"), Pat Hingle ("Batman") , Tobin Bell ("Saw") , Gary Sinise ("Forrest Gump") and Keith David ("Armageddon"). From all the stars here the best are Hackman as the evil sheriff , Crowe as the priest and Henriksen as the shooter . The worst performance gives DiCaprio who is so F***ING ANNOYING , that you wish him dead . Stone is kinda unconvincing in the main role . She's too delicate , not too tough as the role requires. The movie suffers from the fact that it is too serious for it's own good and not too much fun as it wants to be. I think that the story they got here deserved a serious movie . Serious western . Unfortunately , Raimi decided to do a pastiche . It was a wrong move , because there isn't too much fun moments here . The movie lacks heart , despite some real potential . Raimi never allows the viewer to take his moment seriously , so all the serious moments are emotionally flat and wasted . In the end what we've got here is a unconvincing pastiche that isn't too much interesting . It's not a bad movie , but in other hands it could be a classic western movie. I give it 5/10.

    The Quick and the Dead is a good, if not a bit derivative western. It seems like this was one of the few westerns to come out in the 1990's due to the lack of popularity. This is a good shoot-em-up that has fun gun battles, great acting, impressive visual shots of the landscape, and smooth direction from Sam Raimi. Raimi's film is about a lone female rider who rides into the town of Redemption looking for some revenge. She takes part of a contest held by the sadistic man named Herod in order to make Herod pay for ruining her life. This film features some great acting. I believe it's been proved that Gene Hackman can do anything. This role reminds me of his famous role he had in Unforgiven. Sharon Stone is decent and pretty-looking. Russell Crowe is great as usual as the preacher and young Leo proves he has acting chops in his pre-Titanic days. Overall, this is a fine western even though it offers nothing new. The action is pretty good and there were even a few jokes that produced mild chuckles from me. This is a worthy addition to any Western collection out there. I rate this film 9/10.

    Even if viewed as a cartoonish interpretation of Westerns this picture splats to the lowest level of the genre. Preposterous plot and sluggish development of same (you can't make chicken salad out of chicken feed...), the direction seems mesmerized by Stone's undeniable good looks and Hackman's villainous mugging. Absent a convincing story line the plot resorts to endless shoot 'em-up sequences and a blown-to-smithereens ending that masquerades as a an inferno finale --notwhithstanding the fact that the explosion sequences alternate with shots that show little damage to the town's buildings and no casualties among the predictable melange of denizens. The sound track is absurd, climaxing at the end with Stone's steps along the dirt street resonating as if she were stomping on a granite floor, and the music, to put it kindly, mimics Ennio Morricone's early (and better) efforts. In sum: an eminently avoidable fiasco unless viewed as a tongue-in-cheek compendium of some of the worst clich&eacute;s of non- spaghetti Westerns.

    On paper, The Quick and the Dead sounds like just my kinda thing as I am a pretty big fan of both the Western genre and Raimi. He is a stylish director, using kinetic, frantic camera movements to both advance plot and visually please the audience. Unfortunately, here he completely drops the ball and is unable to string together the narrative of what is one of the most basic and re-told stories in American movies. Sharon Stone is the lone gunslinger who wanders into town with an apparent grudge against its' head gangster, Gene Hackman. Hackman chews the scenery like he is back on the set of Superman and is clearly having a blast, Stone on the other hand is so woefully miscast that it is just embarrassing. She never for a moment convinces us that she is anything more than a Hollywood princess playing dress up and when she has to square up to Hackman it is like watching a teenager throw a temper tantrum. Stone doesn't realise the director thinks he is making a comedy, which is something she probably should have cleared up with him as she, in her role as producer, hired him. Russell Crowe is underwhelming as the bad guy turned good and he can't hide that Ozzie accent. Leonardo DiCaprio rounds out the key players and he is fine as the young brash wannabe legend, showing that movie star charisma and handsome smile that would define him for a generation of teenage girls a few years later.
