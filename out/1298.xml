 <sinopse>
  A pretentiously artistic director is hired for a new Broadway musical and changes it beyond recognition.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Tony Hunter, a famous singer/dancer movie star, is feeling washed up and old hat (old top hat, tie and tails to be exact). The reporters are out for Ava Gardner, not him. But his old friends Lily and Les Martin have an idea for a funny little Broadway show and he agrees to do it. But things begin to get out of hand, when bigshot "artistic" director/producer/star Jeffrey Cordova joins the production, proclaims it's a modernistic Faust and insists on hiring a prima ballerina, Gabrielle Gerard, to star opposite Tony, and it's hate at first sight. And her jealous choreographer isn't helping to ease the tension. The show is doomed by pretentiousness. But romance, a "let's put on a show" epiphany, and a triumphant opening are waiting in the wings. After all, this is a musical comedy!

    It is a brave film which has a song called That's Entertainment! as its signature number. Because if, as is unfortunately the case with The Band Wagon, the film is not great entertainment...well, the negative review practically writes itself. This is a film which has the good fortune to have two great talents, Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, and the misfortune of completely wasting them. It's a film full of largely forgettable musical numbers and it has a story which never really engages and which in the end goes off the rails completely. To call the film tedious would be harsh but not entirely untrue. The film goes for laughs but fails rather miserably in that regard. It tries to give you a little romance but that angle never heats up. The film has no flow to it, there is a real disjointed feel throughout. No, this is not entertainment. Astaire plays declining movie star Tony Hunter. His friends Lester and Lily Marton have written a stage show which they think can revive his career. They bring it to noted Broadway director/producer/star Jeffrey Cordova who decides to turn what was written as a light comedy into a serious, and seriously bizarre, retelling of Faust. Not surprisingly this proves disastrous. Lester and Lily start bickering. The play, which no longer makes any sense whatsoever, spirals out of control. And all the while tension rises between Tony and his costar, ballerina Gabrielle Gerard. Tony is intimidated by Gabrielle's youth and beauty, not for no reason with Charisse playing the part. And he thinks this classically trained ballerina has no respect for his style of hoofing. Tony and Gabrielle have no chemistry, can't stand one another, can't work together. Eventually they do come together somewhat which provides the film with perhaps its one true highlight, Astaire and Charisse with a wonderful, beautiful dance in a park. Unfortunately after that Tony and Gabrielle's play continues to crumble and so does the film. By the time Astaire and Charisse dance together again much later on the film is past the point of being salvageable. Astaire and Charisse really were hung out to dry here. The supporting cast adds nothing. The loony Cordova character is meant to be over-the-top but Jack Buchanan goes way too far with it. This character is too nuts for the film's good. At least he has some spark to him which is more than can be said for the writing couple, Lester and Lily. Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray play those parts quite lifelessly. And James Mitchell, playing a romantic interest for Gabrielle, is a total wet blanket with all the personality of a doorknob. The musical numbers all fall flat and many make no sense whatsoever. By the end the film is just throwing random songs up on the screen to see what sticks. None of it does. Some of the numbers in the film's homestretch are obviously meant to be funny but they are just terrible, producing groans not laughs. The big final number is a little better even if, as with so much of what preceded it, it makes very little sense. The best musicals have a lot of life in them. The Band Wagon does not. The energy just is not there. The story doesn't work, the songs are forgettable, the performances of the supporting cast leave much to be desired. Astaire and Charisse have a couple of moments. A couple of moments is not enough to make a good film.

    This Fred Astaire film is a bit unique. For once, Astaire plays a man much like himself and this self-deprecating humor makes the film quite enjoyable. For example, the film begins with a couple guys on a train talking about how great Tony Hunter (Astaire) WAS but how he's a bit washed up now---and Hunter is sitting behind a newspaper and he loudly agrees with them! Later, when he's paired with Gabrielle (Cyd Charisse), he complains that he's much too old for her! The story begins with Hunter arriving in New York city to meet a couple old friends who want him in their newest production. Lester and Lily (Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray) think it's a great idea to get a big-name but EXTREMELY self-absorbed actor-director for this production. However, Cordova (Jack Buchanan) wants to completely take over the show and make it his vision--a vision that is quite the opposite of Hunter's style. The show seems destined to fail. Can there be any way to save it from this megalomaniac? The show features many excellent production numbers--all of which are very polished and exciting to watch. The most memorable occurs early in the film when they sing "That's Entertainment" but several other numbers really are crowd-pleasers (like the weird one where they are dressed like babies). As for the story, it's enjoyable and light. My only complaint is Levant. During the 40s, 50s and 60s, he was one of the cleverest raconteurs in Hollywood and on television and was able to deliver wonderful one-liners that could bust your gut. Here, however, he's hardly noticeable. Could it be that they misused him? Or, possibly, that Levant was having emotional problems and just wasn't himself (he was VERY public about his history of Bipolar Disorder). I just know that I was hoping to hear the snappy Oscar Levant. As for the rest, they are all quite good and the film quite enjoyable--one of Astaire's best of the 1950s.

    I've come to the conclusion that Vincente Minelli and Oscar Levant are cinematic poison. Imagine how good An American in Paris and Brigadoon could have been if Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly had been the directing team. Imagine how much better all movies, TV shows and piano recitals could have been without Oscar Levant, whose main claim to fame was that he was a friend of George Gershwin. Astaire and Charisse are phenomenal, but even they can't redeem this mishmash of forgettable songs, tortuous plotting and second-rate supporting actors/singers/dancers. They deserved better.

    The plot-line is a familiar puttin'-on-a-show backstage musical story that went back twenty years to the beginning of talkies, but clever inside jokes and showbiz references are woven into it for the enjoyment of those in the know: Jack Buchanan's Broadway 'genius' is a sly take on Jose Ferrer, who at one time had written, directed or was starring in four shows running on Broadway simultaneously; Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray's professionally functional / personally dysfunctional relationship is a riff on famous MGM songwriting team Betty Comden and Adolphe Greene; and Fred Astaire is basically playing himself as a movie star of an earlier vintage making a comeback on Broadway amidst much younger talent. The actual story line is almost a throwaway - Buchanan's monumentally over-produced show bombs out of town and has to be revised before making its Broadway debut, but at the same time it gives the viewer a chance to ruminate on the musical as a form and glimpse the creative process as decisions get made initially for reasons of ego and personality and then are changed in favor of what the audience is responding to. Charisse is a better dancer than an actress and seems a bit uncomfortable sharing intimate small talk with Astaire, yet she shines in her numbers, especially the final Mickey Spillane film noir spoof at the end, which is as visually clever and elaborate as anything she did opposite Gene Kelly as MGM's top musical actress of the 50s. There is running gag in the movie that Charisse might be too big to dance with Astaire, and with her obvious muscularity she certainly looks like she could bench press him; in actuality Astaire was taller at 5-9 than Charisse's 5-7 and 1/2. She just couldn't stand next to him in heels.

    The Band Wagon is directed by Vincente Minnelli and written by Alan Jay Lerner, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Songs are written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. It stars Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant, Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan. Out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it's a Technicolor production with cinematography by Harry Jackson. Story tells of ageing musical star Tony Hunter (Astaire) whose cinema glory days appear to be well behind him. Upon the request of his friends Lester (Lavant) & Lily Martin (Fabray), he heads to Broadway to appear in a play they have written with him in mind. He hopes this will restart his career, however, the play's director, Jeffrey Cordova (Buchanan), changes the play into an arty interpretation of the Faust legend. Not only that, but he brings in prima ballerina Gabrielle Gerard (Charisse) to star in it, and Tony and Gabrielle don't exactly hit it off. One of the greatest musicals to come out of MGM, The Band Wagon makes up for what it loses in plot ingenuity, with quality songs, stunning choreography, bustling vitality and heart, big heart! Three parts of the film is made up of character building and said characters attempts to put a show on successfully in spite of behind the scenes worries. Then the final third then switches in mood with a different show and primary characters come to their respective destinies. Along the way we are treated to a series of wonderful song and dance routines, with the stand outs being "Be Myself," "A Shine on My Shoes," "That's Entertainment," "Dancing in the Dark," "I Love Louisa," "I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan" and the joyously macabre, "Triplets." These are then crowned magnificently by "Girl Hunt," an elongated parody of noir-type crime movies from the golden era, where it's not just Fred and Cyd who sparkle, but the dance troupe around them also dazzle the eyes with some truly amazing moves. Where the big heart comes in to it is with Astaire's take on the role of Tony. It's very touching at times, full of nostalgia pangs for his former glories. He also has good comic timing, whilst readily able to laugh at himself as the (thin) narrative thread reminds him of his ageing years. The latter of which accounts for the not so great chemistry with the divine Charisse, but the film under Minnelli's active direction easily overcomes this tiny flaw. There's also some salt in the story in the observation of what goes on behind the scenes of a Broadway play, specifically the people pulling the strings. Big production for a big movie, all told, it's big entertainment, yes indeed. 9/10

    The opening titles of Vincente Minnelli's The Band Wagon play over a top hat and cane, which would evoke Fred Astaire even if he weren't the movie's star. Then we see an auction of movie memorabilia. The top hat and cane don't go, even when the auctioneer begs, "50 cents? Anyone?" They belonged to one-time entertainer Tony Hunter, and now we see him, played by Astaire, on a train to NYC. Perhaps he can recover on Broadway. From how he sings "By Myself," he doesn't sound optimistic. The Band Wagon is a comedy, but has a tone of sorrow with its smirks, a grief ever-pervasive among Broadway people, who've seen more letdown than triumph, who understand the show inevitably closes and that the family disperses and returns to the indeterminate state of auditions and out-of-town callbacks. The movie takes a fictitious musical through all the phases of writing, casting, production, choreography, rehearsals, catastrophe on tour and ultimate success on Broadway. It's so blissfully alert to its genre, but it relies on familiarity with the real functioning situations of Broadway pros, just like Singin' in the Rain knew all about the studio-era movie business. The Astaire and Charisse characters are assembled by Jeffrey Cordova, a director-producer-star with arty affectations, who believes the sparkling little musical by the Martons should be revised as a variation on Faust. Cordova is supposedly inspired by Jose Ferrer, but in the self-image and grandiose plans there's a reverberation of Orson Welles. Buchanan, who ribs his own aristocratic poise, enjoys a character who lacks any realistic understanding of budgetary limitations or the patience of an audience. One of the movie's gems is when he admits he's off beam and Astaire is right, and they do a soft-shoe to "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Astaire and Charisse get into a fuming scrap when they first meet, and then, in the scene where the movie's allure first truly emerges, they reconcile mutely in the "Dancing in the Dark" scene in Central Park under a full moon. Here and throughout the film, Charisse is a sexy and qualified equal for Astaire. The extravagant Faustian musical has "got more scenery than Yellowstone National Park." As the disheartened cast assembles in a hotel suite, they perk themselves up with the "I Love Louisa" number, but right when the song ends everyone goes right back into a glum slouch. MGM didn't just reprocess Broadway sensations. They produced new ones from square one, often applying songs they already had. That's effective here because, upon ditching the Faustian musical, the players resolve to stage a variety show. One original song would become a hallmark: Deitz and Schwartz's "That's Entertainment," which commemorates showbiz as merrily though not as madcap as Donald O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" in Singin' in the Rain. One of the older songs that makes a somewhat feebler comeback here is "Louisiana Hayride." Even if in an extravaganza anything, as it were, goes, the hayride feels a little forced. Another number, however, the uncanny "Triplets," sees Astaire, Fabray and Buchanan all deceptively midgets masqueraded like toddlers, sliding down from their high chairs and foxtrotting. Because we see their feet hit the floor and special effects look out of the question, how did they do that?! Part of the movie's fascination comes from a feeling that what we see is not so different from the real course of making it. It's entertainment for sure, but it's also uphill struggle, and Astaire chain-smokes from beginning to end. "I don't think a dancer should smoke," Charisse exhorts early on, but by the end, she's bumming.

    The Band Wagon was one of those films I'd always managed to miss but which turned out to be a lot of fun. There are minor flaws - Cyd Charisse is unflatteringly shot for much of the picture and is nobody's idea of a prima ballerina, Oscar Levant is clearly well lubricated and sadly well past his prime, while there are quite a few technical fluffs, be it the shadow of the camera making yet another appearance or the stagehand strolling casually across the background in the Louisiana Hayride number, and the Girl Hunt ballet finale goes on far too long as per many post-American in Paris MGM musicals - but Comden and Green's script is so sharp and the numbers so good that none of that really matters. Great fun, and glorious Technicolor too.

    The Band Wagon was the last of three of three musicals produced by Arthur Freed that used a selection of numbers by a song-writing team of the previous generation, the first two being An American in Paris (Gershwin) and Singin' in the Rain (Freed and Brown). This time round the music is by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, a lesser-known duo, but their tunes are certainly pretty enough, while their witty and often satirical lyrics make them suited to this nifty take on the long-established backstage musical. There was a bit of a trend round this time in Hollywood for pictures in which the career of the star and their character mirrored one another. Just like Tony Hunter, Fred Astaire really was thought to be an anachronism in some quarters, and had only recently come out of the first of his three retirements. The Band Wagon is to Astaire effectively a light-hearted and less cruel equivalent of what Sunset Boulevard (1950) was to Gloria Swanson, or what A Star is Born (1954) would be to Judy Garland. And while it may swap screen for stage, many of its cheeky digs apply to both media  the misguided vision of a slightly out-of-touch producer, the poaching of stars from different disciplines, the embarrassment of a badly-received premier. There's even spoofing of previous Freed/Minnelli musicals such as The Pirate (the pyrotechnics in the latter movie's daydream sequence are exaggerated her in the Cordova stage show), and of course the Girl Hunt ballet, which lampoons all those convoluted film noirs like The Big Sleep and Out of the Past with spot-on precision, right down to the mean dialogue that is not far from what you really heard in some of the more lowbrow crime thrillers. Girl Hunt is one of the funniest and rhythmically beautiful moments in the picture, and it alone makes the picture worth the watch. Director Vincente Minnelli could really bring a musical like this to life unlike anyone else. His style, a little ostentatious in a drama, is perfect here because it is a kind of choreography. Of course, anyone can have a hard cut or a whip-pan to emphasise a dynamic phrase, but it's the way Minnelli responds to the subtleties of the music that make him stand out. Take the very laid-back "By Myself" number. Those various people walking in the opposite direction to Astaire are timed to the occasional little twiddles in the underscoring. It's a really delicate balance here  those bits of business are not dancey enough to distract from the smoothness of the song or stop Fred being the focus of attention, and yet they add just enough to make it a little more interesting than simply him walking along an empty platform. There are also some great examples here of Minnelli's bold use of colour, in which funnily enough it is often the more muted shades that stand out. For example, when Astaire meets Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant at the station, the three of them are dressed in grey while all the bolder tones are used for background detail. While all Freed musicals have a deliberately unreal look to them even outside of the musical numbers, it's important that this doesn't spill over into making the people and places look ridiculous. It's Minnelli's good taste in these situations that bridges the gap between the idealised musical world and settings we can relate to. And what of the cast, all willingly lampooning if not themselves then at least their trade? Astaire always had a bit of a self-deprecating streak, and he appears to have good fun with the more comical scenes in particular. However unlike Tony Hunter, The Band Wagon failed to regenerate Astaire's career, perhaps because it doesn't quite make such spectacular displays of his dancing as did his older movies, and perhaps because he really was now an old-fashioned player. Whatever the case he went on to have only middling successes for the rest of his career. Astaire also happens to be overshadowed by the supporting performances in this one  Nanette Fabray and her delightfully amusing array of facial expressions, Oscar Levant going a little over the top but still showing great comic timing, and most of all Jack Buchanan. Buchanan absolutely excels in his wild and well-informed caricature of the flamboyant theatre impresario, hilarious even when underplaying, such as when he gets hoisted aloft like a puppet by incompetent stagehands, funnier still when overplaying, such as his crazed acting-out of the Faust story to a group of backers, which Minnelli shrewdly gives us in little snippets through a doorway. Buchanan never really made a big impression in any other screen appearance, but as the madcap Jeff Cordova he deserved at least a nod for Best Supporting Actor. The Band Wagon is not only a fantastic musical; it represents one of the nicest things about Hollywood in the post-war era. For every film noir or gritty drama that picked apart its subject manner with brutal cynicism, there always seemed to be a comedy or a musical doing the same thing in a gentle and even joyful manner. Writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green jumped on the band wagon of Show Business introspection, for an intelligent script that some might dismiss as froth, but only because it lacks the sombre tone of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve. And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

    The songs are simply excellent. Most especially Astaire and Buchanann singing "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Their soft shoe dance routine reinforces the sophistication we should all summon when the girl of our dreams turns out to be the girl of someone else's dreams. "That's Entertainment" "By Myself" two other excellent moments. The final mise-en-scene with Fred Astair and Cyd Charise shows a darkness to Astaire that is often overlooked in his easy comedy. But Rogers and Hammerstein, and before them Hammerstein and Kern--SHOW BOAT--had created and perfected on Broadway the 'integrated musical' where music moved the story line forward. What Fred Astaire, Arthur Freed, Vincent Minnelli had done was a throwback to the review which can best be encapsulated: let's put on a show. Whether that show would be 42 STREET, BABES IN ARMS, THE GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933, or Broadway MELODY--pick a year--they all came down to a vehicle to show off dancing and singing. I don't think this movie wears well over time. It's not as good as SINGING IN THE RAIN which seems smoother and more finished than this film does. Even Comden and Green ON THE TOWN had a smoother unity than this one did. And certainly by 1953, it doesn't even approach anything Rogers and Hammerstein produced on stage, and would produce on film in the future; a standard we all respond to and measure other movie musicals to. Fred Astaire was the best song and dance man in Hollywood; his limited vocal range showed off the lyrics; his comedy was often a self-mockery; his acting was passable for what his roles expected of him. There are no better films then TOP HAT, GAY DIVORCE, EASTER PARADE, and all those movies with Ginger Rogers. Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Dorothy Fields, the Gershwins appreciated the phrasing he brought to a song that made the song important, not the singer. Sadly, this movie reflected a time long gone and simply does not hold up under time. The viewer of 2010 has now seen CABARET, CHICAGO, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. In BANDWAGON, the parts are better than the whole: the viewer loves to see the Fred Astaire and Jack Buchanann soft shoe, but wading through the rest of the story line seems less than rewarding.

    I have seen my fair share of good musicals as well as some disappointing ones. What's for sure for me, The Band Wagon is one of my favourites from the genre. It has a good engaging story and a witty script. It also has brilliant direction from the great Vincente Minelli, and absolutely fabulous production design from the scenery to the costumes. And the choreography is really clever and fabulous, and the same applies for the superb music. As for the performances, Fred Astaire is very likable and stunning here, and Cyd Charisse is simply gorgeous. There are also some very memorable sequences namely the Dancing in the Dark sequence and the Mickey Spillaine parody The Girl Hunt ballet. Overall, this film is fabulous and one of the best of the musical genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox

However, Cordova (Jack Buchanan) wants to completely take over the show and make it his vision--a vision that is quite the opposite of Hunter's style. The show seems destined to fail. Can there be any way to save it from this megalomaniac? The show features many excellent production numbers--all of which are very polished and exciting to watch. The most memorable occurs early in the film when they sing "That's Entertainment" but several other numbers really are crowd-pleasers (like the weird one where they are dressed like babies). As for the story, it's enjoyable and light. My only complaint is Levant. During the 40s, 50s and 60s, he was one of the cleverest raconteurs in Hollywood and on television and was able to deliver wonderful one-liners that could bust your gut. Here, however, he's hardly noticeable. Could it be that they misused him? Or, possibly, that Levant was having emotional problems and just wasn't himself (he was VERY public about his history of Bipolar Disorder). I just know that I was hoping to hear the snappy Oscar Levant. As for the rest, they are all quite good and the film quite enjoyable--one of Astaire's best of the 1950s.

    I've come to the conclusion that Vincente Minelli and Oscar Levant are cinematic poison. Imagine how good An American in Paris and Brigadoon could have been if Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly had been the directing team. Imagine how much better all movies, TV shows and piano recitals could have been without Oscar Levant, whose main claim to fame was that he was a friend of George Gershwin. Astaire and Charisse are phenomenal, but even they can't redeem this mishmash of forgettable songs, tortuous plotting and second-rate supporting actors/singers/dancers. They deserved better.

    The plot-line is a familiar puttin'-on-a-show backstage musical story that went back twenty years to the beginning of talkies, but clever inside jokes and showbiz references are woven into it for the enjoyment of those in the know: Jack Buchanan's Broadway 'genius' is a sly take on Jose Ferrer, who at one time had written, directed or was starring in four shows running on Broadway simultaneously; Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray's professionally functional / personally dysfunctional relationship is a riff on famous MGM songwriting team Betty Comden and Adolphe Greene; and Fred Astaire is basically playing himself as a movie star of an earlier vintage making a comeback on Broadway amidst much younger talent. The actual story line is almost a throwaway - Buchanan's monumentally over-produced show bombs out of town and has to be revised before making its Broadway debut, but at the same time it gives the viewer a chance to ruminate on the musical as a form and glimpse the creative process as decisions get made initially for reasons of ego and personality and then are changed in favor of what the audience is responding to. Charisse is a better dancer than an actress and seems a bit uncomfortable sharing intimate small talk with Astaire, yet she shines in her numbers, especially the final Mickey Spillane film noir spoof at the end, which is as visually clever and elaborate as anything she did opposite Gene Kelly as MGM's top musical actress of the 50s. There is running gag in the movie that Charisse might be too big to dance with Astaire, and with her obvious muscularity she certainly looks like she could bench press him; in actuality Astaire was taller at 5-9 than Charisse's 5-7 and 1/2. She just couldn't stand next to him in heels.

    The Band Wagon is directed by Vincente Minnelli and written by Alan Jay Lerner, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Songs are written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. It stars Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant, Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan. Out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it's a Technicolor production with cinematography by Harry Jackson. Story tells of ageing musical star Tony Hunter (Astaire) whose cinema glory days appear to be well behind him. Upon the request of his friends Lester (Lavant) & Lily Martin (Fabray), he heads to Broadway to appear in a play they have written with him in mind. He hopes this will restart his career, however, the play's director, Jeffrey Cordova (Buchanan), changes the play into an arty interpretation of the Faust legend. Not only that, but he brings in prima ballerina Gabrielle Gerard (Charisse) to star in it, and Tony and Gabrielle don't exactly hit it off. One of the greatest musicals to come out of MGM, The Band Wagon makes up for what it loses in plot ingenuity, with quality songs, stunning choreography, bustling vitality and heart, big heart! Three parts of the film is made up of character building and said characters attempts to put a show on successfully in spite of behind the scenes worries. Then the final third then switches in mood with a different show and primary characters come to their respective destinies. Along the way we are treated to a series of wonderful song and dance routines, with the stand outs being "Be Myself," "A Shine on My Shoes," "That's Entertainment," "Dancing in the Dark," "I Love Louisa," "I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan" and the joyously macabre, "Triplets." These are then crowned magnificently by "Girl Hunt," an elongated parody of noir-type crime movies from the golden era, where it's not just Fred and Cyd who sparkle, but the dance troupe around them also dazzle the eyes with some truly amazing moves. Where the big heart comes in to it is with Astaire's take on the role of Tony. It's very touching at times, full of nostalgia pangs for his former glories. He also has good comic timing, whilst readily able to laugh at himself as the (thin) narrative thread reminds him of his ageing years. The latter of which accounts for the not so great chemistry with the divine Charisse, but the film under Minnelli's active direction easily overcomes this tiny flaw. There's also some salt in the story in the observation of what goes on behind the scenes of a Broadway play, specifically the people pulling the strings. Big production for a big movie, all told, it's big entertainment, yes indeed. 9/10

    The opening titles of Vincente Minnelli's The Band Wagon play over a top hat and cane, which would evoke Fred Astaire even if he weren't the movie's star. Then we see an auction of movie memorabilia. The top hat and cane don't go, even when the auctioneer begs, "50 cents? Anyone?" They belonged to one-time entertainer Tony Hunter, and now we see him, played by Astaire, on a train to NYC. Perhaps he can recover on Broadway. From how he sings "By Myself," he doesn't sound optimistic. The Band Wagon is a comedy, but has a tone of sorrow with its smirks, a grief ever-pervasive among Broadway people, who've seen more letdown than triumph, who understand the show inevitably closes and that the family disperses and returns to the indeterminate state of auditions and out-of-town callbacks. The movie takes a fictitious musical through all the phases of writing, casting, production, choreography, rehearsals, catastrophe on tour and ultimate success on Broadway. It's so blissfully alert to its genre, but it relies on familiarity with the real functioning situations of Broadway pros, just like Singin' in the Rain knew all about the studio-era movie business. The Astaire and Charisse characters are assembled by Jeffrey Cordova, a director-producer-star with arty affectations, who believes the sparkling little musical by the Martons should be revised as a variation on Faust. Cordova is supposedly inspired by Jose Ferrer, but in the self-image and grandiose plans there's a reverberation of Orson Welles. Buchanan, who ribs his own aristocratic poise, enjoys a character who lacks any realistic understanding of budgetary limitations or the patience of an audience. One of the movie's gems is when he admits he's off beam and Astaire is right, and they do a soft-shoe to "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Astaire and Charisse get into a fuming scrap when they first meet, and then, in the scene where the movie's allure first truly emerges, they reconcile mutely in the "Dancing in the Dark" scene in Central Park under a full moon. Here and throughout the film, Charisse is a sexy and qualified equal for Astaire. The extravagant Faustian musical has "got more scenery than Yellowstone National Park." As the disheartened cast assembles in a hotel suite, they perk themselves up with the "I Love Louisa" number, but right when the song ends everyone goes right back into a glum slouch. MGM didn't just reprocess Broadway sensations. They produced new ones from square one, often applying songs they already had. That's effective here because, upon ditching the Faustian musical, the players resolve to stage a variety show. One original song would become a hallmark: Deitz and Schwartz's "That's Entertainment," which commemorates showbiz as merrily though not as madcap as Donald O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" in Singin' in the Rain. One of the older songs that makes a somewhat feebler comeback here is "Louisiana Hayride." Even if in an extravaganza anything, as it were, goes, the hayride feels a little forced. Another number, however, the uncanny "Triplets," sees Astaire, Fabray and Buchanan all deceptively midgets masqueraded like toddlers, sliding down from their high chairs and foxtrotting. Because we see their feet hit the floor and special effects look out of the question, how did they do that?! Part of the movie's fascination comes from a feeling that what we see is not so different from the real course of making it. It's entertainment for sure, but it's also uphill struggle, and Astaire chain-smokes from beginning to end. "I don't think a dancer should smoke," Charisse exhorts early on, but by the end, she's bumming.

    The Band Wagon was one of those films I'd always managed to miss but which turned out to be a lot of fun. There are minor flaws - Cyd Charisse is unflatteringly shot for much of the picture and is nobody's idea of a prima ballerina, Oscar Levant is clearly well lubricated and sadly well past his prime, while there are quite a few technical fluffs, be it the shadow of the camera making yet another appearance or the stagehand strolling casually across the background in the Louisiana Hayride number, and the Girl Hunt ballet finale goes on far too long as per many post-American in Paris MGM musicals - but Comden and Green's script is so sharp and the numbers so good that none of that really matters. Great fun, and glorious Technicolor too.

    The Band Wagon was the last of three of three musicals produced by Arthur Freed that used a selection of numbers by a song-writing team of the previous generation, the first two being An American in Paris (Gershwin) and Singin' in the Rain (Freed and Brown). This time round the music is by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, a lesser-known duo, but their tunes are certainly pretty enough, while their witty and often satirical lyrics make them suited to this nifty take on the long-established backstage musical. There was a bit of a trend round this time in Hollywood for pictures in which the career of the star and their character mirrored one another. Just like Tony Hunter, Fred Astaire really was thought to be an anachronism in some quarters, and had only recently come out of the first of his three retirements. The Band Wagon is to Astaire effectively a light-hearted and less cruel equivalent of what Sunset Boulevard (1950) was to Gloria Swanson, or what A Star is Born (1954) would be to Judy Garland. And while it may swap screen for stage, many of its cheeky digs apply to both media  the misguided vision of a slightly out-of-touch producer, the poaching of stars from different disciplines, the embarrassment of a badly-received premier. There's even spoofing of previous Freed/Minnelli musicals such as The Pirate (the pyrotechnics in the latter movie's daydream sequence are exaggerated her in the Cordova stage show), and of course the Girl Hunt ballet, which lampoons all those convoluted film noirs like The Big Sleep and Out of the Past with spot-on precision, right down to the mean dialogue that is not far from what you really heard in some of the more lowbrow crime thrillers. Girl Hunt is one of the funniest and rhythmically beautiful moments in the picture, and it alone makes the picture worth the watch. Director Vincente Minnelli could really bring a musical like this to life unlike anyone else. His style, a little ostentatious in a drama, is perfect here because it is a kind of choreography. Of course, anyone can have a hard cut or a whip-pan to emphasise a dynamic phrase, but it's the way Minnelli responds to the subtleties of the music that make him stand out. Take the very laid-back "By Myself" number. Those various people walking in the opposite direction to Astaire are timed to the occasional little twiddles in the underscoring. It's a really delicate balance here  those bits of business are not dancey enough to distract from the smoothness of the song or stop Fred being the focus of attention, and yet they add just enough to make it a little more interesting than simply him walking along an empty platform. There are also some great examples here of Minnelli's bold use of colour, in which funnily enough it is often the more muted shades that stand out. For example, when Astaire meets Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant at the station, the three of them are dressed in grey while all the bolder tones are used for background detail. While all Freed musicals have a deliberately unreal look to them even outside of the musical numbers, it's important that this doesn't spill over into making the people and places look ridiculous. It's Minnelli's good taste in these situations that bridges the gap between the idealised musical world and settings we can relate to. And what of the cast, all willingly lampooning if not themselves then at least their trade? Astaire always had a bit of a self-deprecating streak, and he appears to have good fun with the more comical scenes in particular. However unlike Tony Hunter, The Band Wagon failed to regenerate Astaire's career, perhaps because it doesn't quite make such spectacular displays of his dancing as did his older movies, and perhaps because he really was now an old-fashioned player. Whatever the case he went on to have only middling successes for the rest of his career. Astaire also happens to be overshadowed by the supporting performances in this one  Nanette Fabray and her delightfully amusing array of facial expressions, Oscar Levant going a little over the top but still showing great comic timing, and most of all Jack Buchanan. Buchanan absolutely excels in his wild and well-informed caricature of the flamboyant theatre impresario, hilarious even when underplaying, such as when he gets hoisted aloft like a puppet by incompetent stagehands, funnier still when overplaying, such as his crazed acting-out of the Faust story to a group of backers, which Minnelli shrewdly gives us in little snippets through a doorway. Buchanan never really made a big impression in any other screen appearance, but as the madcap Jeff Cordova he deserved at least a nod for Best Supporting Actor. The Band Wagon is not only a fantastic musical; it represents one of the nicest things about Hollywood in the post-war era. For every film noir or gritty drama that picked apart its subject manner with brutal cynicism, there always seemed to be a comedy or a musical doing the same thing in a gentle and even joyful manner. Writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green jumped on the band wagon of Show Business introspection, for an intelligent script that some might dismiss as froth, but only because it lacks the sombre tone of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve. And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

    The songs are simply excellent. Most especially Astaire and Buchanann singing "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Their soft shoe dance routine reinforces the sophistication we should all summon when the girl of our dreams turns out to be the girl of someone else's dreams. "That's Entertainment" "By Myself" two other excellent moments. The final mise-en-scene with Fred Astair and Cyd Charise shows a darkness to Astaire that is often overlooked in his easy comedy. But Rogers and Hammerstein, and before them Hammerstein and Kern--SHOW BOAT--had created and perfected on Broadway the 'integrated musical' where music moved the story line forward. What Fred Astaire, Arthur Freed, Vincent Minnelli had done was a throwback to the review which can best be encapsulated: let's put on a show. Whether that show would be 42 STREET, BABES IN ARMS, THE GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933, or Broadway MELODY--pick a year--they all came down to a vehicle to show off dancing and singing. I don't think this movie wears well over time. It's not as good as SINGING IN THE RAIN which seems smoother and more finished than this film does. Even Comden and Green ON THE TOWN had a smoother unity than this one did. And certainly by 1953, it doesn't even approach anything Rogers and Hammerstein produced on stage, and would produce on film in the future; a standard we all respond to and measure other movie musicals to. Fred Astaire was the best song and dance man in Hollywood; his limited vocal range showed off the lyrics; his comedy was often a self-mockery; his acting was passable for what his roles expected of him. There are no better films then TOP HAT, GAY DIVORCE, EASTER PARADE, and all those movies with Ginger Rogers. Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Dorothy Fields, the Gershwins appreciated the phrasing he brought to a song that made the song important, not the singer. Sadly, this movie reflected a time long gone and simply does not hold up under time. The viewer of 2010 has now seen CABARET, CHICAGO, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. In BANDWAGON, the parts are better than the whole: the viewer loves to see the Fred Astaire and Jack Buchanann soft shoe, but wading through the rest of the story line seems less than rewarding.

    I have seen my fair share of good musicals as well as some disappointing ones. What's for sure for me, The Band Wagon is one of my favourites from the genre. It has a good engaging story and a witty script. It also has brilliant direction from the great Vincente Minelli, and absolutely fabulous production design from the scenery to the costumes. And the choreography is really clever and fabulous, and the same applies for the superb music. As for the performances, Fred Astaire is very likable and stunning here, and Cyd Charisse is simply gorgeous. There are also some very memorable sequences namely the Dancing in the Dark sequence and the Mickey Spillaine parody The Girl Hunt ballet. Overall, this film is fabulous and one of the best of the musical genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    It is a brave film which has a song called That's Entertainment! as its signature number. Because if, as is unfortunately the case with The Band Wagon, the film is not great entertainment...well, the negative review practically writes itself. This is a film which has the good fortune to have two great talents, Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, and the misfortune of completely wasting them. It's a film full of largely forgettable musical numbers and it has a story which never really engages and which in the end goes off the rails completely. To call the film tedious would be harsh but not entirely untrue. The film goes for laughs but fails rather miserably in that regard. It tries to give you a little romance but that angle never heats up. The film has no flow to it, there is a real disjointed feel throughout. No, this is not entertainment. Astaire plays declining movie star Tony Hunter. His friends Lester and Lily Marton have written a stage show which they think can revive his career. They bring it to noted Broadway director/producer/star Jeffrey Cordova who decides to turn what was written as a light comedy into a serious, and seriously bizarre, retelling of Faust. Not surprisingly this proves disastrous. Lester and Lily start bickering. The play, which no longer makes any sense whatsoever, spirals out of control. And all the while tension rises between Tony and his costar, ballerina Gabrielle Gerard. Tony is intimidated by Gabrielle's youth and beauty, not for no reason with Charisse playing the part. And he thinks this classically trained ballerina has no respect for his style of hoofing. Tony and Gabrielle have no chemistry, can't stand one another, can't work together. Eventually they do come together somewhat which provides the film with perhaps its one true highlight, Astaire and Charisse with a wonderful, beautiful dance in a park. Unfortunately after that Tony and Gabrielle's play continues to crumble and so does the film. By the time Astaire and Charisse dance together again much later on the film is past the point of being salvageable. Astaire and Charisse really were hung out to dry here. The supporting cast adds nothing. The loony Cordova character is meant to be over-the-top but Jack Buchanan goes way too far with it. This character is too nuts for the film's good. At least he has some spark to him which is more than can be said for the writing couple, Lester and Lily. Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray play those parts quite lifelessly. And James Mitchell, playing a romantic interest for Gabrielle, is a total wet blanket with all the personality of a doorknob. The musical numbers all fall flat and many make no sense whatsoever. By the end the film is just throwing random songs up on the screen to see what sticks. None of it does. Some of the numbers in the film's homestretch are obviously meant to be funny but they are just terrible, producing groans not laughs. The big final number is a little better even if, as with so much of what preceded it, it makes very little sense. The best musicals have a lot of life in them. The Band Wagon does not. The energy just is not there. The story doesn't work, the songs are forgettable, the performances of the supporting cast leave much to be desired. Astaire and Charisse have a couple of moments. A couple of moments is not enough to make a good film.

    This Fred Astaire film is a bit unique. For once, Astaire plays a man much like himself and this self-deprecating humor makes the film quite enjoyable. For example, the film begins with a couple guys on a train talking about how great Tony Hunter (Astaire) WAS but how he's a bit washed up now---and Hunter is sitting behind a newspaper and he loudly agrees with them! Later, when he's paired with Gabrielle (Cyd Charisse), he complains that he's much too old for her! The story begins with Hunter arriving in New York city to meet a couple old friends who want him in their newest production. Lester and Lily (Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray) think it's a great idea to get a big-name but EXTREMELY self-absorbed actor-director for this production. However, Cordova (Jack Buchanan) wants to completely take over the show and make it his vision--a vision that is quite the opposite of Hunter's style. The show seems destined to fail.

    The opening titles of Vincente Minnelli's The Band Wagon play over a top hat and cane, which would evoke Fred Astaire even if he weren't the movie's star. Then we see an auction of movie memorabilia. The top hat and cane don't go, even when the auctioneer begs, "50 cents? Anyone?" They belonged to one-time entertainer Tony Hunter, and now we see him, played by Astaire, on a train to NYC. Perhaps he can recover on Broadway. From how he sings "By Myself," he doesn't sound optimistic. The Band Wagon is a comedy, but has a tone of sorrow with its smirks, a grief ever-pervasive among Broadway people, who've seen more letdown than triumph, who understand the show inevitably closes and that the family disperses and returns to the indeterminate state of auditions and out-of-town callbacks. The movie takes a fictitious musical through all the phases of writing, casting, production, choreography, rehearsals, catastrophe on tour and ultimate success on Broadway. It's so blissfully alert to its genre, but it relies on familiarity with the real functioning situations of Broadway pros, just like Singin' in the Rain knew all about the studio-era movie business. The Astaire and Charisse characters are assembled by Jeffrey Cordova, a director-producer-star with arty affectations, who believes the sparkling little musical by the Martons should be revised as a variation on Faust. Cordova is supposedly inspired by Jose Ferrer, but in the self-image and grandiose plans there's a reverberation of Orson Welles. Buchanan, who ribs his own aristocratic poise, enjoys a character who lacks any realistic understanding of budgetary limitations or the patience of an audience. One of the movie's gems is when he admits he's off beam and Astaire is right, and they do a soft-shoe to "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Astaire and Charisse get into a fuming scrap when they first meet, and then, in the scene where the movie's allure first truly emerges, they reconcile mutely in the "Dancing in the Dark" scene in Central Park under a full moon. Here and throughout the film, Charisse is a sexy and qualified equal for Astaire. The extravagant Faustian musical has "got more scenery than Yellowstone National Park." As the disheartened cast assembles in a hotel suite, they perk themselves up with the "I Love Louisa" number, but right when the song ends everyone goes right back into a glum slouch. MGM didn't just reprocess Broadway sensations. They produced new ones from square one, often applying songs they already had. That's effective here because, upon ditching the Faustian musical, the players resolve to stage a variety show. One original song would become a hallmark: Deitz and Schwartz's "That's Entertainment," which commemorates showbiz as merrily though not as madcap as Donald O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" in Singin' in the Rain. One of the older songs that makes a somewhat feebler comeback here is "Louisiana Hayride." Even if in an extravaganza anything, as it were, goes, the hayride feels a little forced. Another number, however, the uncanny "Triplets," sees Astaire, Fabray and Buchanan all deceptively midgets masqueraded like toddlers, sliding down from their high chairs and foxtrotting. Because we see their feet hit the floor and special effects look out of the question, how did they do that?! Part of the movie's fascination comes from a feeling that what we see is not so different from the real course of making it. It's entertainment for sure, but it's also uphill struggle, and Astaire chain-smokes from beginning to end. "I don't think a dancer should smoke," Charisse exhorts early on, but by the end, she's bumming.

    The Band Wagon was one of those films I'd always managed to miss but which turned out to be a lot of fun. There are minor flaws - Cyd Charisse is unflatteringly shot for much of the picture and is nobody's idea of a prima ballerina, Oscar Levant is clearly well lubricated and sadly well past his prime, while there are quite a few technical fluffs, be it the shadow of the camera making yet another appearance or the stagehand strolling casually across the background in the Louisiana Hayride number, and the Girl Hunt ballet finale goes on far too long as per many post-American in Paris MGM musicals - but Comden and Green's script is so sharp and the numbers so good that none of that really matters. Great fun, and glorious Technicolor too.

    The Band Wagon was the last of three of three musicals produced by Arthur Freed that used a selection of numbers by a song-writing team of the previous generation, the first two being An American in Paris (Gershwin) and Singin' in the Rain (Freed and Brown). This time round the music is by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, a lesser-known duo, but their tunes are certainly pretty enough, while their witty and often satirical lyrics make them suited to this nifty take on the long-established backstage musical. There was a bit of a trend round this time in Hollywood for pictures in which the career of the star and their character mirrored one another. Just like Tony Hunter, Fred Astaire really was thought to be an anachronism in some quarters, and had only recently come out of the first of his three retirements. The Band Wagon is to Astaire effectively a light-hearted and less cruel equivalent of what Sunset Boulevard (1950) was to Gloria Swanson, or what A Star is Born (1954) would be to Judy Garland. And while it may swap screen for stage, many of its cheeky digs apply to both media  the misguided vision of a slightly out-of-touch producer, the poaching of stars from different disciplines, the embarrassment of a badly-received premier. There's even spoofing of previous Freed/Minnelli musicals such as The Pirate (the pyrotechnics in the latter movie's daydream sequence are exaggerated her in the Cordova stage show), and of course the Girl Hunt ballet, which lampoons all those convoluted film noirs like The Big Sleep and Out of the Past with spot-on precision, right down to the mean dialogue that is not far from what you really heard in some of the more lowbrow crime thrillers. Girl Hunt is one of the funniest and rhythmically beautiful moments in the picture, and it alone makes the picture worth the watch. Director Vincente Minnelli could really bring a musical like this to life unlike anyone else. His style, a little ostentatious in a drama, is perfect here because it is a kind of choreography. Of course, anyone can have a hard cut or a whip-pan to emphasise a dynamic phrase, but it's the way Minnelli responds to the subtleties of the music that make him stand out. Take the very laid-back "By Myself" number. Those various people walking in the opposite direction to Astaire are timed to the occasional little twiddles in the underscoring. It's a really delicate balance here  those bits of business are not dancey enough to distract from the smoothness of the song or stop Fred being the focus of attention, and yet they add just enough to make it a little more interesting than simply him walking along an empty platform. There are also some great examples here of Minnelli's bold use of colour, in which funnily enough it is often the more muted shades that stand out. For example, when Astaire meets Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant at the station, the three of them are dressed in grey while all the bolder tones are used for background detail. While all Freed musicals have a deliberately unreal look to them even outside of the musical numbers, it's important that this doesn't spill over into making the people and places look ridiculous. It's Minnelli's good taste in these situations that bridges the gap between the idealised musical world and settings we can relate to. And what of the cast, all willingly lampooning if not themselves then at least their trade? Astaire always had a bit of a self-deprecating streak, and he appears to have good fun with the more comical scenes in particular. However unlike Tony Hunter, The Band Wagon failed to regenerate Astaire's career, perhaps because it doesn't quite make such spectacular displays of his dancing as did his older movies, and perhaps because he really was now an old-fashioned player. Whatever the case he went on to have only middling successes for the rest of his career. Astaire also happens to be overshadowed by the supporting performances in this one  Nanette Fabray and her delightfully amusing array of facial expressions, Oscar Levant going a little over the top but still showing great comic timing, and most of all Jack Buchanan. Buchanan absolutely excels in his wild and well-informed caricature of the flamboyant theatre impresario, hilarious even when underplaying, such as when he gets hoisted aloft like a puppet by incompetent stagehands, funnier still when overplaying, such as his crazed acting-out of the Faust story to a group of backers, which Minnelli shrewdly gives us in little snippets through a doorway. Buchanan never really made a big impression in any other screen appearance, but as the madcap Jeff Cordova he deserved at least a nod for Best Supporting Actor. The Band Wagon is not only a fantastic musical; it represents one of the nicest things about Hollywood in the post-war era. For every film noir or gritty drama that picked apart its subject manner with brutal cynicism, there always seemed to be a comedy or a musical doing the same thing in a gentle and even joyful manner. Writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green jumped on the band wagon of Show Business introspection, for an intelligent script that some might dismiss as froth, but only because it lacks the sombre tone of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve. And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

    The songs are simply excellent. Most especially Astaire and Buchanann singing "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Their soft shoe dance routine reinforces the sophistication we should all summon when the girl of our dreams turns out to be the girl of someone else's dreams. "That's Entertainment" "By Myself" two other excellent moments. The final mise-en-scene with Fred Astair and Cyd Charise shows a darkness to Astaire that is often overlooked in his easy comedy. But Rogers and Hammerstein, and before them Hammerstein and Kern--SHOW BOAT--had created and perfected on Broadway the 'integrated musical' where music moved the story line forward. What Fred Astaire, Arthur Freed, Vincent Minnelli had done was a throwback to the review which can best be encapsulated: let's put on a show. Whether that show would be 42 STREET, BABES IN ARMS, THE GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933, or Broadway MELODY--pick a year--they all came down to a vehicle to show off dancing and singing. I don't think this movie wears well over time. It's not as good as SINGING IN THE RAIN which seems smoother and more finished than this film does. Even Comden and Green ON THE TOWN had a smoother unity than this one did. And certainly by 1953, it doesn't even approach anything Rogers and Hammerstein produced on stage, and would produce on film in the future; a standard we all respond to and measure other movie musicals to. Fred Astaire was the best song and dance man in Hollywood; his limited vocal range showed off the lyrics; his comedy was often a self-mockery; his acting was passable for what his roles expected of him. There are no better films then TOP HAT, GAY DIVORCE, EASTER PARADE, and all those movies with Ginger Rogers. Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Dorothy Fields, the Gershwins appreciated the phrasing he brought to a song that made the song important, not the singer. Sadly, this movie reflected a time long gone and simply does not hold up under time. The viewer of 2010 has now seen CABARET, CHICAGO, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. In BANDWAGON, the parts are better than the whole: the viewer loves to see the Fred Astaire and Jack Buchanann soft shoe, but wading through the rest of the story line seems less than rewarding.

    I have seen my fair share of good musicals as well as some disappointing ones. What's for sure for me, The Band Wagon is one of my favourites from the genre. It has a good engaging story and a witty script. It also has brilliant direction from the great Vincente Minelli, and absolutely fabulous production design from the scenery to the costumes. And the choreography is really clever and fabulous, and the same applies for the superb music. As for the performances, Fred Astaire is very likable and stunning here, and Cyd Charisse is simply gorgeous. There are also some very memorable sequences namely the Dancing in the Dark sequence and the Mickey Spillaine parody The Girl Hunt ballet. Overall, this film is fabulous and one of the best of the musical genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    It is a brave film which has a song called That's Entertainment! as its signature number. Because if, as is unfortunately the case with The Band Wagon, the film is not great entertainment...well, the negative review practically writes itself. This is a film which has the good fortune to have two great talents, Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, and the misfortune of completely wasting them. It's a film full of largely forgettable musical numbers and it has a story which never really engages and which in the end goes off the rails completely. To call the film tedious would be harsh but not entirely untrue. The film goes for laughs but fails rather miserably in that regard. It tries to give you a little romance but that angle never heats up. The film has no flow to it, there is a real disjointed feel throughout. No, this is not entertainment. Astaire plays declining movie star Tony Hunter. His friends Lester and Lily Marton have written a stage show which they think can revive his career. They bring it to noted Broadway director/producer/star Jeffrey Cordova who decides to turn what was written as a light comedy into a serious, and seriously bizarre, retelling of Faust. Not surprisingly this proves disastrous. Lester and Lily start bickering. The play, which no longer makes any sense whatsoever, spirals out of control. And all the while tension rises between Tony and his costar, ballerina Gabrielle Gerard. Tony is intimidated by Gabrielle's youth and beauty, not for no reason with Charisse playing the part. And he thinks this classically trained ballerina has no respect for his style of hoofing. Tony and Gabrielle have no chemistry, can't stand one another, can't work together. Eventually they do come together somewhat which provides the film with perhaps its one true highlight, Astaire and Charisse with a wonderful, beautiful dance in a park. Unfortunately after that Tony and Gabrielle's play continues to crumble and so does the film. By the time Astaire and Charisse dance together again much later on the film is past the point of being salvageable. Astaire and Charisse really were hung out to dry here. The supporting cast adds nothing. The loony Cordova character is meant to be over-the-top but Jack Buchanan goes way too far with it. This character is too nuts for the film's good. At least he has some spark to him which is more than can be said for the writing couple, Lester and Lily. Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray play those parts quite lifelessly. And James Mitchell, playing a romantic interest for Gabrielle, is a total wet blanket with all the personality of a doorknob. The musical numbers all fall flat and many make no sense whatsoever. By the end the film is just throwing random songs up on the screen to see what sticks. None of it does. Some of the numbers in the film's homestretch are obviously meant to be funny but they are just terrible, producing groans not laughs. The big final number is a little better even if, as with so much of what preceded it, it makes very little sense. The best musicals have a lot of life in them. The Band Wagon does not. The energy just is not there. The story doesn't work, the songs are forgettable, the performances of the supporting cast leave much to be desired. Astaire and Charisse have a couple of moments. A couple of moments is not enough to make a good film.

    This Fred Astaire film is a bit unique. For once, Astaire plays a man much like himself and this self-deprecating humor makes the film quite enjoyable. For example, the film begins with a couple guys on a train talking about how great Tony Hunter (Astaire) WAS but how he's a bit washed up now---and Hunter is sitting behind a newspaper and he loudly agrees with them! Later, when he's paired with Gabrielle (Cyd Charisse), he complains that he's much too old for her! The story begins with Hunter arriving in New York city to meet a couple old friends who want him in their newest production. Lester and Lily (Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray) think it's a great idea to get a big-name but EXTREMELY self-absorbed actor-director for this production. However, Cordova (Jack Buchanan) wants to completely take over the show and make it his vision--a vision that is quite the opposite of Hunter's style. The show seems destined to fail. Can there be any way to save it from this megalomaniac? The show features many excellent production numbers--all of which are very polished and exciting to watch. The most memorable occurs early in the film when they sing "That's Entertainment" but several other numbers really are crowd-pleasers (like the weird one where they are dressed like babies). As for the story, it's enjoyable and light. My only complaint is Levant. During the 40s, 50s and 60s, he was one of the cleverest raconteurs in Hollywood and on television and was able to deliver wonderful one-liners that could bust your gut. Here, however, he's hardly noticeable. Could it be that they misused him? Or, possibly, that Levant was having emotional problems and just wasn't himself (he was VERY public about his history of Bipolar Disorder). I just know that I was hoping to hear the snappy Oscar Levant. As for the rest, they are all quite good and the film quite enjoyable--one of Astaire's best of the 1950s.

    I've come to the conclusion that Vincente Minelli and Oscar Levant are cinematic poison. Imagine how good An American in Paris and Brigadoon could have been if Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly had been the directing team. Imagine how much better all movies, TV shows and piano recitals could have been without Oscar Levant, whose main claim to fame was that he was a friend of George Gershwin. Astaire and Charisse are phenomenal, but even they can't redeem this mishmash of forgettable songs, tortuous plotting and second-rate supporting actors/singers/dancers. They deserved better.

    The plot-line is a familiar puttin'-on-a-show backstage musical story that went back twenty years to the beginning of talkies, but clever inside jokes and showbiz references are woven into it for the enjoyment of those in the know: Jack Buchanan's Broadway 'genius' is a sly take on Jose Ferrer, who at one time had written, directed or was starring in four shows running on Broadway simultaneously; Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray's professionally functional / personally dysfunctional relationship is a riff on famous MGM songwriting team Betty Comden and Adolphe Greene; and Fred Astaire is basically playing himself as a movie star of an earlier vintage making a comeback on Broadway amidst much younger talent. The actual story line is almost a throwaway - Buchanan's monumentally over-produced show bombs out of town and has to be revised before making its Broadway debut, but at the same time it gives the viewer a chance to ruminate on the musical as a form and glimpse the creative process as decisions get made initially for reasons of ego and personality and then are changed in favor of what the audience is responding to. Charisse is a better dancer than an actress and seems a bit uncomfortable sharing intimate small talk with Astaire, yet she shines in her numbers, especially the final Mickey Spillane film noir spoof at the end, which is as visually clever and elaborate as anything she did opposite Gene Kelly as MGM's top musical actress of the 50s. There is running gag in the movie that Charisse might be too big to dance with Astaire, and with her obvious muscularity she certainly looks like she could bench press him; in actuality Astaire was taller at 5-9 than Charisse's 5-7 and 1/2. She just couldn't stand next to him in heels.

    The Band Wagon is directed by Vincente Minnelli and written by Alan Jay Lerner, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Songs are written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. It stars Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant, Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan. Out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it's a Technicolor production with cinematography by Harry Jackson. Story tells of ageing musical star Tony Hunter (Astaire) whose cinema glory days appear to be well behind him. Upon the request of his friends Lester (Lavant) & Lily Martin (Fabray), he heads to Broadway to appear in a play they have written with him in mind. He hopes this will restart his career, however, the play's director, Jeffrey Cordova (Buchanan), changes the play into an arty interpretation of the Faust legend. Not only that, but he brings in prima ballerina Gabrielle Gerard (Charisse) to star in it, and Tony and Gabrielle don't exactly hit it off. One of the greatest musicals to come out of MGM, The Band Wagon makes up for what it loses in plot ingenuity, with quality songs, stunning choreography, bustling vitality and heart, big heart! Three parts of the film is made up of character building and said characters attempts to put a show on successfully in spite of behind the scenes worries. Then the final third then switches in mood with a different show and primary characters come to their respective destinies. Along the way we are treated to a series of wonderful song and dance routines, with the stand outs being "Be Myself," "A Shine on My Shoes," "That's Entertainment," "Dancing in the Dark," "I Love Louisa," "I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan" and the joyously macabre, "Triplets." These are then crowned magnificently by "Girl Hunt," an elongated parody of noir-type crime movies from the golden era, where it's not just Fred and Cyd who sparkle, but the dance troupe around them also dazzle the eyes with some truly amazing moves. Where the big heart comes in to it is with Astaire's take on the role of Tony. It's very touching at times, full of nostalgia pangs for his former glories. He also has good comic timing, whilst readily able to laugh at himself as the (thin) narrative thread reminds him of his ageing years. The latter of which accounts for the not so great chemistry with the divine Charisse, but the film under Minnelli's active direction easily overcomes this tiny flaw. There's also some salt in the story in the observation of what goes on behind the scenes of a Broadway play, specifically the people pulling the strings. Big production for a big movie, all told, it's big entertainment, yes indeed. 9/10

Take the very laid-back "By Myself" number. Those various people walking in the opposite direction to Astaire are timed to the occasional little twiddles in the underscoring. It's a really delicate balance here  those bits of business are not dancey enough to distract from the smoothness of the song or stop Fred being the focus of attention, and yet they add just enough to make it a little more interesting than simply him walking along an empty platform. There are also some great examples here of Minnelli's bold use of colour, in which funnily enough it is often the more muted shades that stand out. For example, when Astaire meets Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant at the station, the three of them are dressed in grey while all the bolder tones are used for background detail. While all Freed musicals have a deliberately unreal look to them even outside of the musical numbers, it's important that this doesn't spill over into making the people and places look ridiculous. It's Minnelli's good taste in these situations that bridges the gap between the idealised musical world and settings we can relate to. And what of the cast, all willingly lampooning if not themselves then at least their trade? Astaire always had a bit of a self-deprecating streak, and he appears to have good fun with the more comical scenes in particular. However unlike Tony Hunter, The Band Wagon failed to regenerate Astaire's career, perhaps because it doesn't quite make such spectacular displays of his dancing as did his older movies, and perhaps because he really was now an old-fashioned player. Whatever the case he went on to have only middling successes for the rest of his career. Astaire also happens to be overshadowed by the supporting performances in this one  Nanette Fabray and her delightfully amusing array of facial expressions, Oscar Levant going a little over the top but still showing great comic timing, and most of all Jack Buchanan. Buchanan absolutely excels in his wild and well-informed caricature of the flamboyant theatre impresario, hilarious even when underplaying, such as when he gets hoisted aloft like a puppet by incompetent stagehands, funnier still when overplaying, such as his crazed acting-out of the Faust story to a group of backers, which Minnelli shrewdly gives us in little snippets through a doorway. Buchanan never really made a big impression in any other screen appearance, but as the madcap Jeff Cordova he deserved at least a nod for Best Supporting Actor. The Band Wagon is not only a fantastic musical; it represents one of the nicest things about Hollywood in the post-war era. For every film noir or gritty drama that picked apart its subject manner with brutal cynicism, there always seemed to be a comedy or a musical doing the same thing in a gentle and even joyful manner. Writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green jumped on the band wagon of Show Business introspection, for an intelligent script that some might dismiss as froth, but only because it lacks the sombre tone of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve. And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

    The songs are simply excellent. Most especially Astaire and Buchanann singing "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Their soft shoe dance routine reinforces the sophistication we should all summon when the girl of our dreams turns out to be the girl of someone else's dreams. "That's Entertainment" "By Myself" two other excellent moments. The final mise-en-scene with Fred Astair and Cyd Charise shows a darkness to Astaire that is often overlooked in his easy comedy. But Rogers and Hammerstein, and before them Hammerstein and Kern--SHOW BOAT--had created and perfected on Broadway the 'integrated musical' where music moved the story line forward. What Fred Astaire, Arthur Freed, Vincent Minnelli had done was a throwback to the review which can best be encapsulated: let's put on a show. Whether that show would be 42 STREET, BABES IN ARMS, THE GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933, or Broadway MELODY--pick a year--they all came down to a vehicle to show off dancing and singing. I don't think this movie wears well over time. It's not as good as SINGING IN THE RAIN which seems smoother and more finished than this film does. Even Comden and Green ON THE TOWN had a smoother unity than this one did. And certainly by 1953, it doesn't even approach anything Rogers and Hammerstein produced on stage, and would produce on film in the future; a standard we all respond to and measure other movie musicals to. Fred Astaire was the best song and dance man in Hollywood; his limited vocal range showed off the lyrics; his comedy was often a self-mockery; his acting was passable for what his roles expected of him. There are no better films then TOP HAT, GAY DIVORCE, EASTER PARADE, and all those movies with Ginger Rogers. Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Dorothy Fields, the Gershwins appreciated the phrasing he brought to a song that made the song important, not the singer. Sadly, this movie reflected a time long gone and simply does not hold up under time. The viewer of 2010 has now seen CABARET, CHICAGO, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. In BANDWAGON, the parts are better than the whole: the viewer loves to see the Fred Astaire and Jack Buchanann soft shoe, but wading through the rest of the story line seems less than rewarding.

    I have seen my fair share of good musicals as well as some disappointing ones. What's for sure for me, The Band Wagon is one of my favourites from the genre. It has a good engaging story and a witty script. It also has brilliant direction from the great Vincente Minelli, and absolutely fabulous production design from the scenery to the costumes. And the choreography is really clever and fabulous, and the same applies for the superb music. As for the performances, Fred Astaire is very likable and stunning here, and Cyd Charisse is simply gorgeous. There are also some very memorable sequences namely the Dancing in the Dark sequence and the Mickey Spillaine parody The Girl Hunt ballet. Overall, this film is fabulous and one of the best of the musical genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    It is a brave film which has a song called That's Entertainment! as its signature number. Because if, as is unfortunately the case with The Band Wagon, the film is not great entertainment...well, the negative review practically writes itself. This is a film which has the good fortune to have two great talents, Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, and the misfortune of completely wasting them. It's a film full of largely forgettable musical numbers and it has a story which never really engages and which in the end goes off the rails completely. To call the film tedious would be harsh but not entirely untrue. The film goes for laughs but fails rather miserably in that regard. It tries to give you a little romance but that angle never heats up. The film has no flow to it, there is a real disjointed feel throughout. No, this is not entertainment. Astaire plays declining movie star Tony Hunter. His friends Lester and Lily Marton have written a stage show which they think can revive his career. They bring it to noted Broadway director/producer/star Jeffrey Cordova who decides to turn what was written as a light comedy into a serious, and seriously bizarre, retelling of Faust. Not surprisingly this proves disastrous. Lester and Lily start bickering. The play, which no longer makes any sense whatsoever, spirals out of control. And all the while tension rises between Tony and his costar, ballerina Gabrielle Gerard. Tony is intimidated by Gabrielle's youth and beauty, not for no reason with Charisse playing the part. And he thinks this classically trained ballerina has no respect for his style of hoofing. Tony and Gabrielle have no chemistry, can't stand one another, can't work together. Eventually they do come together somewhat which provides the film with perhaps its one true highlight, Astaire and Charisse with a wonderful, beautiful dance in a park. Unfortunately after that Tony and Gabrielle's play continues to crumble and so does the film. By the time Astaire and Charisse dance together again much later on the film is past the point of being salvageable. Astaire and Charisse really were hung out to dry here. The supporting cast adds nothing. The loony Cordova character is meant to be over-the-top but Jack Buchanan goes way too far with it. This character is too nuts for the film's good. At least he has some spark to him which is more than can be said for the writing couple, Lester and Lily. Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray play those parts quite lifelessly. And James Mitchell, playing a romantic interest for Gabrielle, is a total wet blanket with all the personality of a doorknob. The musical numbers all fall flat and many make no sense whatsoever. By the end the film is just throwing random songs up on the screen to see what sticks. None of it does. Some of the numbers in the film's homestretch are obviously meant to be funny but they are just terrible, producing groans not laughs. The big final number is a little better even if, as with so much of what preceded it, it makes very little sense. The best musicals have a lot of life in them. The Band Wagon does not. The energy just is not there. The story doesn't work, the songs are forgettable, the performances of the supporting cast leave much to be desired. Astaire and Charisse have a couple of moments. A couple of moments is not enough to make a good film.

    This Fred Astaire film is a bit unique. For once, Astaire plays a man much like himself and this self-deprecating humor makes the film quite enjoyable. For example, the film begins with a couple guys on a train talking about how great Tony Hunter (Astaire) WAS but how he's a bit washed up now---and Hunter is sitting behind a newspaper and he loudly agrees with them! Later, when he's paired with Gabrielle (Cyd Charisse), he complains that he's much too old for her! The story begins with Hunter arriving in New York city to meet a couple old friends who want him in their newest production. Lester and Lily (Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray) think it's a great idea to get a big-name but EXTREMELY self-absorbed actor-director for this production. However, Cordova (Jack Buchanan) wants to completely take over the show and make it his vision--a vision that is quite the opposite of Hunter's style. The show seems destined to fail. Can there be any way to save it from this megalomaniac? The show features many excellent production numbers--all of which are very polished and exciting to watch. The most memorable occurs early in the film when they sing "That's Entertainment" but several other numbers really are crowd-pleasers (like the weird one where they are dressed like babies). As for the story, it's enjoyable and light. My only complaint is Levant. During the 40s, 50s and 60s, he was one of the cleverest raconteurs in Hollywood and on television and was able to deliver wonderful one-liners that could bust your gut. Here, however, he's hardly noticeable. Could it be that they misused him? Or, possibly, that Levant was having emotional problems and just wasn't himself (he was VERY public about his history of Bipolar Disorder). I just know that I was hoping to hear the snappy Oscar Levant. As for the rest, they are all quite good and the film quite enjoyable--one of Astaire's best of the 1950s.

    I've come to the conclusion that Vincente Minelli and Oscar Levant are cinematic poison. Imagine how good An American in Paris and Brigadoon could have been if Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly had been the directing team. Imagine how much better all movies, TV shows and piano recitals could have been without Oscar Levant, whose main claim to fame was that he was a friend of George Gershwin. Astaire and Charisse are phenomenal, but even they can't redeem this mishmash of forgettable songs, tortuous plotting and second-rate supporting actors/singers/dancers. They deserved better.

    The plot-line is a familiar puttin'-on-a-show backstage musical story that went back twenty years to the beginning of talkies, but clever inside jokes and showbiz references are woven into it for the enjoyment of those in the know: Jack Buchanan's Broadway 'genius' is a sly take on Jose Ferrer, who at one time had written, directed or was starring in four shows running on Broadway simultaneously; Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray's professionally functional / personally dysfunctional relationship is a riff on famous MGM songwriting team Betty Comden and Adolphe Greene; and Fred Astaire is basically playing himself as a movie star of an earlier vintage making a comeback on Broadway amidst much younger talent. The actual story line is almost a throwaway - Buchanan's monumentally over-produced show bombs out of town and has to be revised before making its Broadway debut, but at the same time it gives the viewer a chance to ruminate on the musical as a form and glimpse the creative process as decisions get made initially for reasons of ego and personality and then are changed in favor of what the audience is responding to. Charisse is a better dancer than an actress and seems a bit uncomfortable sharing intimate small talk with Astaire, yet she shines in her numbers, especially the final Mickey Spillane film noir spoof at the end, which is as visually clever and elaborate as anything she did opposite Gene Kelly as MGM's top musical actress of the 50s. There is running gag in the movie that Charisse might be too big to dance with Astaire, and with her obvious muscularity she certainly looks like she could bench press him; in actuality Astaire was taller at 5-9 than Charisse's 5-7 and 1/2. She just couldn't stand next to him in heels.

    The Band Wagon is directed by Vincente Minnelli and written by Alan Jay Lerner, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Songs are written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. It stars Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant, Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan. Out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it's a Technicolor production with cinematography by Harry Jackson. Story tells of ageing musical star Tony Hunter (Astaire) whose cinema glory days appear to be well behind him. Upon the request of his friends Lester (Lavant) & Lily Martin (Fabray), he heads to Broadway to appear in a play they have written with him in mind. He hopes this will restart his career, however, the play's director, Jeffrey Cordova (Buchanan), changes the play into an arty interpretation of the Faust legend. Not only that, but he brings in prima ballerina Gabrielle Gerard (Charisse) to star in it, and Tony and Gabrielle don't exactly hit it off. One of the greatest musicals to come out of MGM, The Band Wagon makes up for what it loses in plot ingenuity, with quality songs, stunning choreography, bustling vitality and heart, big heart! Three parts of the film is made up of character building and said characters attempts to put a show on successfully in spite of behind the scenes worries. Then the final third then switches in mood with a different show and primary characters come to their respective destinies. Along the way we are treated to a series of wonderful song and dance routines, with the stand outs being "Be Myself," "A Shine on My Shoes," "That's Entertainment," "Dancing in the Dark," "I Love Louisa," "I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan" and the joyously macabre, "Triplets." These are then crowned magnificently by "Girl Hunt," an elongated parody of noir-type crime movies from the golden era, where it's not just Fred and Cyd who sparkle, but the dance troupe around them also dazzle the eyes with some truly amazing moves. Where the big heart comes in to it is with Astaire's take on the role of Tony. It's very touching at times, full of nostalgia pangs for his former glories. He also has good comic timing, whilst readily able to laugh at himself as the (thin) narrative thread reminds him of his ageing years. The latter of which accounts for the not so great chemistry with the divine Charisse, but the film under Minnelli's active direction easily overcomes this tiny flaw. There's also some salt in the story in the observation of what goes on behind the scenes of a Broadway play, specifically the people pulling the strings. Big production for a big movie, all told, it's big entertainment, yes indeed. 9/10

    The opening titles of Vincente Minnelli's The Band Wagon play over a top hat and cane, which would evoke Fred Astaire even if he weren't the movie's star. Then we see an auction of movie memorabilia. The top hat and cane don't go, even when the auctioneer begs, "50 cents? Anyone?" They belonged to one-time entertainer Tony Hunter, and now we see him, played by Astaire, on a train to NYC. Perhaps he can recover on Broadway. From how he sings "By Myself," he doesn't sound optimistic. The Band Wagon is a comedy, but has a tone of sorrow with its smirks, a grief ever-pervasive among Broadway people, who've seen more letdown than triumph, who understand the show inevitably closes and that the family disperses and returns to the indeterminate state of auditions and out-of-town callbacks. The movie takes a fictitious musical through all the phases of writing, casting, production, choreography, rehearsals, catastrophe on tour and ultimate success on Broadway. It's so blissfully alert to its genre, but it relies on familiarity with the real functioning situations of Broadway pros, just like Singin' in the Rain knew all about the studio-era movie business. The Astaire and Charisse characters are assembled by Jeffrey Cordova, a director-producer-star with arty affectations, who believes the sparkling little musical by the Martons should be revised as a variation on Faust. Cordova is supposedly inspired by Jose Ferrer, but in the self-image and grandiose plans there's a reverberation of Orson Welles. Buchanan, who ribs his own aristocratic poise, enjoys a character who lacks any realistic understanding of budgetary limitations or the patience of an audience. One of the movie's gems is when he admits he's off beam and Astaire is right, and they do a soft-shoe to "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Astaire and Charisse get into a fuming scrap when they first meet, and then, in the scene where the movie's allure first truly emerges, they reconcile mutely in the "Dancing in the Dark" scene in Central Park under a full moon. Here and throughout the film, Charisse is a sexy and qualified equal for Astaire. The extravagant Faustian musical has "got more scenery than Yellowstone National Park." As the disheartened cast assembles in a hotel suite, they perk themselves up with the "I Love Louisa" number, but right when the song ends everyone goes right back into a glum slouch. MGM didn't just reprocess Broadway sensations. They produced new ones from square one, often applying songs they already had. That's effective here because, upon ditching the Faustian musical, the players resolve to stage a variety show. One original song would become a hallmark: Deitz and Schwartz's "That's Entertainment," which commemorates showbiz as merrily though not as madcap as Donald O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" in Singin' in the Rain. One of the older songs that makes a somewhat feebler comeback here is "Louisiana Hayride." Even if in an extravaganza anything, as it were, goes, the hayride feels a little forced. Another number, however, the uncanny "Triplets," sees Astaire, Fabray and Buchanan all deceptively midgets masqueraded like toddlers, sliding down from their high chairs and foxtrotting. Because we see their feet hit the floor and special effects look out of the question, how did they do that?! Part of the movie's fascination comes from a feeling that what we see is not so different from the real course of making it. It's entertainment for sure, but it's also uphill struggle, and Astaire chain-smokes from beginning to end. "I don't think a dancer should smoke," Charisse exhorts early on, but by the end, she's bumming.

    The Band Wagon was one of those films I'd always managed to miss but which turned out to be a lot of fun. There are minor flaws - Cyd Charisse is unflatteringly shot for much of the picture and is nobody's idea of a prima ballerina, Oscar Levant is clearly well lubricated and sadly well past his prime, while there are quite a few technical fluffs, be it the shadow of the camera making yet another appearance or the stagehand strolling casually across the background in the Louisiana Hayride number, and the Girl Hunt ballet finale goes on far too long as per many post-American in Paris MGM musicals - but Comden and Green's script is so sharp and the numbers so good that none of that really matters. Great fun, and glorious Technicolor too.

    The Band Wagon was the last of three of three musicals produced by Arthur Freed that used a selection of numbers by a song-writing team of the previous generation, the first two being An American in Paris (Gershwin) and Singin' in the Rain (Freed and Brown). This time round the music is by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, a lesser-known duo, but their tunes are certainly pretty enough, while their witty and often satirical lyrics make them suited to this nifty take on the long-established backstage musical. There was a bit of a trend round this time in Hollywood for pictures in which the career of the star and their character mirrored one another. Just like Tony Hunter, Fred Astaire really was thought to be an anachronism in some quarters, and had only recently come out of the first of his three retirements. The Band Wagon is to Astaire effectively a light-hearted and less cruel equivalent of what Sunset Boulevard (1950) was to Gloria Swanson, or what A Star is Born (1954) would be to Judy Garland. And while it may swap screen for stage, many of its cheeky digs apply to both media  the misguided vision of a slightly out-of-touch producer, the poaching of stars from different disciplines, the embarrassment of a badly-received premier. There's even spoofing of previous Freed/Minnelli musicals such as The Pirate (the pyrotechnics in the latter movie's daydream sequence are exaggerated her in the Cordova stage show), and of course the Girl Hunt ballet, which lampoons all those convoluted film noirs like The Big Sleep and Out of the Past with spot-on precision, right down to the mean dialogue that is not far from what you really heard in some of the more lowbrow crime thrillers. Girl Hunt is one of the funniest and rhythmically beautiful moments in the picture, and it alone makes the picture worth the watch. Director Vincente Minnelli could really bring a musical like this to life unlike anyone else. His style, a little ostentatious in a drama, is perfect here because it is a kind of choreography. Of course, anyone can have a hard cut or a whip-pan to emphasise a dynamic phrase, but it's the way Minnelli responds to the subtleties of the music that make him stand out. Take the very laid-back "By Myself" number. Those various people walking in the opposite direction to Astaire are timed to the occasional little twiddles in the underscoring. It's a really delicate balance here  those bits of business are not dancey enough to distract from the smoothness of the song or stop Fred being the focus of attention, and yet they add just enough to make it a little more interesting than simply him walking along an empty platform. There are also some great examples here of Minnelli's bold use of colour, in which funnily enough it is often the more muted shades that stand out. For example, when Astaire meets Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant at the station, the three of them are dressed in grey while all the bolder tones are used for background detail. While all Freed musicals have a deliberately unreal look to them even outside of the musical numbers, it's important that this doesn't spill over into making the people and places look ridiculous. It's Minnelli's good taste in these situations that bridges the gap between the idealised musical world and settings we can relate to. And what of the cast, all willingly lampooning if not themselves then at least their trade? Astaire always had a bit of a self-deprecating streak, and he appears to have good fun with the more comical scenes in particular. However unlike Tony Hunter, The Band Wagon failed to regenerate Astaire's career, perhaps because it doesn't quite make such spectacular displays of his dancing as did his older movies, and perhaps because he really was now an old-fashioned player. Whatever the case he went on to have only middling successes for the rest of his career. Astaire also happens to be overshadowed by the supporting performances in this one  Nanette Fabray and her delightfully amusing array of facial expressions, Oscar Levant going a little over the top but still showing great comic timing, and most of all Jack Buchanan. Buchanan absolutely excels in his wild and well-informed caricature of the flamboyant theatre impresario, hilarious even when underplaying, such as when he gets hoisted aloft like a puppet by incompetent stagehands, funnier still when overplaying, such as his crazed acting-out of the Faust story to a group of backers, which Minnelli shrewdly gives us in little snippets through a doorway. Buchanan never really made a big impression in any other screen appearance, but as the madcap Jeff Cordova he deserved at least a nod for Best Supporting Actor. The Band Wagon is not only a fantastic musical; it represents one of the nicest things about Hollywood in the post-war era. For every film noir or gritty drama that picked apart its subject manner with brutal cynicism, there always seemed to be a comedy or a musical doing the same thing in a gentle and even joyful manner. Writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green jumped on the band wagon of Show Business introspection, for an intelligent script that some might dismiss as froth, but only because it lacks the sombre tone of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve. And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

Because if, as is unfortunately the case with The Band Wagon, the film is not great entertainment...well, the negative review practically writes itself. This is a film which has the good fortune to have two great talents, Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, and the misfortune of completely wasting them. It's a film full of largely forgettable musical numbers and it has a story which never really engages and which in the end goes off the rails completely. To call the film tedious would be harsh but not entirely untrue. The film goes for laughs but fails rather miserably in that regard. It tries to give you a little romance but that angle never heats up. The film has no flow to it, there is a real disjointed feel throughout. No, this is not entertainment. Astaire plays declining movie star Tony Hunter. His friends Lester and Lily Marton have written a stage show which they think can revive his career. They bring it to noted Broadway director/producer/star Jeffrey Cordova who decides to turn what was written as a light comedy into a serious, and seriously bizarre, retelling of Faust. Not surprisingly this proves disastrous. Lester and Lily start bickering. The play, which no longer makes any sense whatsoever, spirals out of control. And all the while tension rises between Tony and his costar, ballerina Gabrielle Gerard. Tony is intimidated by Gabrielle's youth and beauty, not for no reason with Charisse playing the part. And he thinks this classically trained ballerina has no respect for his style of hoofing. Tony and Gabrielle have no chemistry, can't stand one another, can't work together. Eventually they do come together somewhat which provides the film with perhaps its one true highlight, Astaire and Charisse with a wonderful, beautiful dance in a park. Unfortunately after that Tony and Gabrielle's play continues to crumble and so does the film. By the time Astaire and Charisse dance together again much later on the film is past the point of being salvageable. Astaire and Charisse really were hung out to dry here. The supporting cast adds nothing. The loony Cordova character is meant to be over-the-top but Jack Buchanan goes way too far with it. This character is too nuts for the film's good. At least he has some spark to him which is more than can be said for the writing couple, Lester and Lily. Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray play those parts quite lifelessly. And James Mitchell, playing a romantic interest for Gabrielle, is a total wet blanket with all the personality of a doorknob. The musical numbers all fall flat and many make no sense whatsoever. By the end the film is just throwing random songs up on the screen to see what sticks. None of it does. Some of the numbers in the film's homestretch are obviously meant to be funny but they are just terrible, producing groans not laughs. The big final number is a little better even if, as with so much of what preceded it, it makes very little sense. The best musicals have a lot of life in them. The Band Wagon does not. The energy just is not there. The story doesn't work, the songs are forgettable, the performances of the supporting cast leave much to be desired. Astaire and Charisse have a couple of moments. A couple of moments is not enough to make a good film.

    This Fred Astaire film is a bit unique. For once, Astaire plays a man much like himself and this self-deprecating humor makes the film quite enjoyable. For example, the film begins with a couple guys on a train talking about how great Tony Hunter (Astaire) WAS but how he's a bit washed up now---and Hunter is sitting behind a newspaper and he loudly agrees with them! Later, when he's paired with Gabrielle (Cyd Charisse), he complains that he's much too old for her! The story begins with Hunter arriving in New York city to meet a couple old friends who want him in their newest production. Lester and Lily (Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray) think it's a great idea to get a big-name but EXTREMELY self-absorbed actor-director for this production. However, Cordova (Jack Buchanan) wants to completely take over the show and make it his vision--a vision that is quite the opposite of Hunter's style. The show seems destined to fail. Can there be any way to save it from this megalomaniac? The show features many excellent production numbers--all of which are very polished and exciting to watch. The most memorable occurs early in the film when they sing "That's Entertainment" but several other numbers really are crowd-pleasers (like the weird one where they are dressed like babies). As for the story, it's enjoyable and light. My only complaint is Levant. During the 40s, 50s and 60s, he was one of the cleverest raconteurs in Hollywood and on television and was able to deliver wonderful one-liners that could bust your gut. Here, however, he's hardly noticeable. Could it be that they misused him? Or, possibly, that Levant was having emotional problems and just wasn't himself (he was VERY public about his history of Bipolar Disorder). I just know that I was hoping to hear the snappy Oscar Levant. As for the rest, they are all quite good and the film quite enjoyable--one of Astaire's best of the 1950s.

    I've come to the conclusion that Vincente Minelli and Oscar Levant are cinematic poison. Imagine how good An American in Paris and Brigadoon could have been if Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly had been the directing team. Imagine how much better all movies, TV shows and piano recitals could have been without Oscar Levant, whose main claim to fame was that he was a friend of George Gershwin. Astaire and Charisse are phenomenal, but even they can't redeem this mishmash of forgettable songs, tortuous plotting and second-rate supporting actors/singers/dancers. They deserved better.

    The plot-line is a familiar puttin'-on-a-show backstage musical story that went back twenty years to the beginning of talkies, but clever inside jokes and showbiz references are woven into it for the enjoyment of those in the know: Jack Buchanan's Broadway 'genius' is a sly take on Jose Ferrer, who at one time had written, directed or was starring in four shows running on Broadway simultaneously; Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray's professionally functional / personally dysfunctional relationship is a riff on famous MGM songwriting team Betty Comden and Adolphe Greene; and Fred Astaire is basically playing himself as a movie star of an earlier vintage making a comeback on Broadway amidst much younger talent. The actual story line is almost a throwaway - Buchanan's monumentally over-produced show bombs out of town and has to be revised before making its Broadway debut, but at the same time it gives the viewer a chance to ruminate on the musical as a form and glimpse the creative process as decisions get made initially for reasons of ego and personality and then are changed in favor of what the audience is responding to. Charisse is a better dancer than an actress and seems a bit uncomfortable sharing intimate small talk with Astaire, yet she shines in her numbers, especially the final Mickey Spillane film noir spoof at the end, which is as visually clever and elaborate as anything she did opposite Gene Kelly as MGM's top musical actress of the 50s. There is running gag in the movie that Charisse might be too big to dance with Astaire, and with her obvious muscularity she certainly looks like she could bench press him; in actuality Astaire was taller at 5-9 than Charisse's 5-7 and 1/2. She just couldn't stand next to him in heels.

    The Band Wagon is directed by Vincente Minnelli and written by Alan Jay Lerner, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Songs are written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. It stars Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant, Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan. Out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it's a Technicolor production with cinematography by Harry Jackson. Story tells of ageing musical star Tony Hunter (Astaire) whose cinema glory days appear to be well behind him. Upon the request of his friends Lester (Lavant) & Lily Martin (Fabray), he heads to Broadway to appear in a play they have written with him in mind. He hopes this will restart his career, however, the play's director, Jeffrey Cordova (Buchanan), changes the play into an arty interpretation of the Faust legend. Not only that, but he brings in prima ballerina Gabrielle Gerard (Charisse) to star in it, and Tony and Gabrielle don't exactly hit it off. One of the greatest musicals to come out of MGM, The Band Wagon makes up for what it loses in plot ingenuity, with quality songs, stunning choreography, bustling vitality and heart, big heart! Three parts of the film is made up of character building and said characters attempts to put a show on successfully in spite of behind the scenes worries. Then the final third then switches in mood with a different show and primary characters come to their respective destinies. Along the way we are treated to a series of wonderful song and dance routines, with the stand outs being "Be Myself," "A Shine on My Shoes," "That's Entertainment," "Dancing in the Dark," "I Love Louisa," "I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan" and the joyously macabre, "Triplets." These are then crowned magnificently by "Girl Hunt," an elongated parody of noir-type crime movies from the golden era, where it's not just Fred and Cyd who sparkle, but the dance troupe around them also dazzle the eyes with some truly amazing moves. Where the big heart comes in to it is with Astaire's take on the role of Tony. It's very touching at times, full of nostalgia pangs for his former glories. He also has good comic timing, whilst readily able to laugh at himself as the (thin) narrative thread reminds him of his ageing years. The latter of which accounts for the not so great chemistry with the divine Charisse, but the film under Minnelli's active direction easily overcomes this tiny flaw. There's also some salt in the story in the observation of what goes on behind the scenes of a Broadway play, specifically the people pulling the strings. Big production for a big movie, all told, it's big entertainment, yes indeed. 9/10

    The opening titles of Vincente Minnelli's The Band Wagon play over a top hat and cane, which would evoke Fred Astaire even if he weren't the movie's star. Then we see an auction of movie memorabilia. The top hat and cane don't go, even when the auctioneer begs, "50 cents? Anyone?" They belonged to one-time entertainer Tony Hunter, and now we see him, played by Astaire, on a train to NYC. Perhaps he can recover on Broadway. From how he sings "By Myself," he doesn't sound optimistic. The Band Wagon is a comedy, but has a tone of sorrow with its smirks, a grief ever-pervasive among Broadway people, who've seen more letdown than triumph, who understand the show inevitably closes and that the family disperses and returns to the indeterminate state of auditions and out-of-town callbacks. The movie takes a fictitious musical through all the phases of writing, casting, production, choreography, rehearsals, catastrophe on tour and ultimate success on Broadway. It's so blissfully alert to its genre, but it relies on familiarity with the real functioning situations of Broadway pros, just like Singin' in the Rain knew all about the studio-era movie business. The Astaire and Charisse characters are assembled by Jeffrey Cordova, a director-producer-star with arty affectations, who believes the sparkling little musical by the Martons should be revised as a variation on Faust. Cordova is supposedly inspired by Jose Ferrer, but in the self-image and grandiose plans there's a reverberation of Orson Welles. Buchanan, who ribs his own aristocratic poise, enjoys a character who lacks any realistic understanding of budgetary limitations or the patience of an audience. One of the movie's gems is when he admits he's off beam and Astaire is right, and they do a soft-shoe to "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Astaire and Charisse get into a fuming scrap when they first meet, and then, in the scene where the movie's allure first truly emerges, they reconcile mutely in the "Dancing in the Dark" scene in Central Park under a full moon. Here and throughout the film, Charisse is a sexy and qualified equal for Astaire. The extravagant Faustian musical has "got more scenery than Yellowstone National Park." As the disheartened cast assembles in a hotel suite, they perk themselves up with the "I Love Louisa" number, but right when the song ends everyone goes right back into a glum slouch. MGM didn't just reprocess Broadway sensations. They produced new ones from square one, often applying songs they already had. That's effective here because, upon ditching the Faustian musical, the players resolve to stage a variety show. One original song would become a hallmark: Deitz and Schwartz's "That's Entertainment," which commemorates showbiz as merrily though not as madcap as Donald O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" in Singin' in the Rain. One of the older songs that makes a somewhat feebler comeback here is "Louisiana Hayride." Even if in an extravaganza anything, as it were, goes, the hayride feels a little forced. Another number, however, the uncanny "Triplets," sees Astaire, Fabray and Buchanan all deceptively midgets masqueraded like toddlers, sliding down from their high chairs and foxtrotting. Because we see their feet hit the floor and special effects look out of the question, how did they do that?! Part of the movie's fascination comes from a feeling that what we see is not so different from the real course of making it. It's entertainment for sure, but it's also uphill struggle, and Astaire chain-smokes from beginning to end. "I don't think a dancer should smoke," Charisse exhorts early on, but by the end, she's bumming.

    The Band Wagon was one of those films I'd always managed to miss but which turned out to be a lot of fun. There are minor flaws - Cyd Charisse is unflatteringly shot for much of the picture and is nobody's idea of a prima ballerina, Oscar Levant is clearly well lubricated and sadly well past his prime, while there are quite a few technical fluffs, be it the shadow of the camera making yet another appearance or the stagehand strolling casually across the background in the Louisiana Hayride number, and the Girl Hunt ballet finale goes on far too long as per many post-American in Paris MGM musicals - but Comden and Green's script is so sharp and the numbers so good that none of that really matters. Great fun, and glorious Technicolor too.

    The Band Wagon was the last of three of three musicals produced by Arthur Freed that used a selection of numbers by a song-writing team of the previous generation, the first two being An American in Paris (Gershwin) and Singin' in the Rain (Freed and Brown). This time round the music is by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, a lesser-known duo, but their tunes are certainly pretty enough, while their witty and often satirical lyrics make them suited to this nifty take on the long-established backstage musical. There was a bit of a trend round this time in Hollywood for pictures in which the career of the star and their character mirrored one another. Just like Tony Hunter, Fred Astaire really was thought to be an anachronism in some quarters, and had only recently come out of the first of his three retirements. The Band Wagon is to Astaire effectively a light-hearted and less cruel equivalent of what Sunset Boulevard (1950) was to Gloria Swanson, or what A Star is Born (1954) would be to Judy Garland. And while it may swap screen for stage, many of its cheeky digs apply to both media  the misguided vision of a slightly out-of-touch producer, the poaching of stars from different disciplines, the embarrassment of a badly-received premier. There's even spoofing of previous Freed/Minnelli musicals such as The Pirate (the pyrotechnics in the latter movie's daydream sequence are exaggerated her in the Cordova stage show), and of course the Girl Hunt ballet, which lampoons all those convoluted film noirs like The Big Sleep and Out of the Past with spot-on precision, right down to the mean dialogue that is not far from what you really heard in some of the more lowbrow crime thrillers. Girl Hunt is one of the funniest and rhythmically beautiful moments in the picture, and it alone makes the picture worth the watch. Director Vincente Minnelli could really bring a musical like this to life unlike anyone else. His style, a little ostentatious in a drama, is perfect here because it is a kind of choreography. Of course, anyone can have a hard cut or a whip-pan to emphasise a dynamic phrase, but it's the way Minnelli responds to the subtleties of the music that make him stand out. Take the very laid-back "By Myself" number. Those various people walking in the opposite direction to Astaire are timed to the occasional little twiddles in the underscoring. It's a really delicate balance here  those bits of business are not dancey enough to distract from the smoothness of the song or stop Fred being the focus of attention, and yet they add just enough to make it a little more interesting than simply him walking along an empty platform. There are also some great examples here of Minnelli's bold use of colour, in which funnily enough it is often the more muted shades that stand out. For example, when Astaire meets Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant at the station, the three of them are dressed in grey while all the bolder tones are used for background detail. While all Freed musicals have a deliberately unreal look to them even outside of the musical numbers, it's important that this doesn't spill over into making the people and places look ridiculous. It's Minnelli's good taste in these situations that bridges the gap between the idealised musical world and settings we can relate to. And what of the cast, all willingly lampooning if not themselves then at least their trade? Astaire always had a bit of a self-deprecating streak, and he appears to have good fun with the more comical scenes in particular. However unlike Tony Hunter, The Band Wagon failed to regenerate Astaire's career, perhaps because it doesn't quite make such spectacular displays of his dancing as did his older movies, and perhaps because he really was now an old-fashioned player. Whatever the case he went on to have only middling successes for the rest of his career. Astaire also happens to be overshadowed by the supporting performances in this one  Nanette Fabray and her delightfully amusing array of facial expressions, Oscar Levant going a little over the top but still showing great comic timing, and most of all Jack Buchanan. Buchanan absolutely excels in his wild and well-informed caricature of the flamboyant theatre impresario, hilarious even when underplaying, such as when he gets hoisted aloft like a puppet by incompetent stagehands, funnier still when overplaying, such as his crazed acting-out of the Faust story to a group of backers, which Minnelli shrewdly gives us in little snippets through a doorway. Buchanan never really made a big impression in any other screen appearance, but as the madcap Jeff Cordova he deserved at least a nod for Best Supporting Actor. The Band Wagon is not only a fantastic musical; it represents one of the nicest things about Hollywood in the post-war era. For every film noir or gritty drama that picked apart its subject manner with brutal cynicism, there always seemed to be a comedy or a musical doing the same thing in a gentle and even joyful manner. Writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green jumped on the band wagon of Show Business introspection, for an intelligent script that some might dismiss as froth, but only because it lacks the sombre tone of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve. And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

    The songs are simply excellent. Most especially Astaire and Buchanann singing "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Their soft shoe dance routine reinforces the sophistication we should all summon when the girl of our dreams turns out to be the girl of someone else's dreams. "That's Entertainment" "By Myself" two other excellent moments. The final mise-en-scene with Fred Astair and Cyd Charise shows a darkness to Astaire that is often overlooked in his easy comedy. But Rogers and Hammerstein, and before them Hammerstein and Kern--SHOW BOAT--had created and perfected on Broadway the 'integrated musical' where music moved the story line forward. What Fred Astaire, Arthur Freed, Vincent Minnelli had done was a throwback to the review which can best be encapsulated: let's put on a show. Whether that show would be 42 STREET, BABES IN ARMS, THE GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933, or Broadway MELODY--pick a year--they all came down to a vehicle to show off dancing and singing. I don't think this movie wears well over time. It's not as good as SINGING IN THE RAIN which seems smoother and more finished than this film does. Even Comden and Green ON THE TOWN had a smoother unity than this one did. And certainly by 1953, it doesn't even approach anything Rogers and Hammerstein produced on stage, and would produce on film in the future; a standard we all respond to and measure other movie musicals to. Fred Astaire was the best song and dance man in Hollywood; his limited vocal range showed off the lyrics; his comedy was often a self-mockery; his acting was passable for what his roles expected of him. There are no better films then TOP HAT, GAY DIVORCE, EASTER PARADE, and all those movies with Ginger Rogers. Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Dorothy Fields, the Gershwins appreciated the phrasing he brought to a song that made the song important, not the singer. Sadly, this movie reflected a time long gone and simply does not hold up under time. The viewer of 2010 has now seen CABARET, CHICAGO, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. In BANDWAGON, the parts are better than the whole: the viewer loves to see the Fred Astaire and Jack Buchanann soft shoe, but wading through the rest of the story line seems less than rewarding.

    I have seen my fair share of good musicals as well as some disappointing ones. What's for sure for me, The Band Wagon is one of my favourites from the genre. It has a good engaging story and a witty script. It also has brilliant direction from the great Vincente Minelli, and absolutely fabulous production design from the scenery to the costumes. And the choreography is really clever and fabulous, and the same applies for the superb music. As for the performances, Fred Astaire is very likable and stunning here, and Cyd Charisse is simply gorgeous. There are also some very memorable sequences namely the Dancing in the Dark sequence and the Mickey Spillaine parody The Girl Hunt ballet. Overall, this film is fabulous and one of the best of the musical genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox

The actual story line is almost a throwaway - Buchanan's monumentally over-produced show bombs out of town and has to be revised before making its Broadway debut, but at the same time it gives the viewer a chance to ruminate on the musical as a form and glimpse the creative process as decisions get made initially for reasons of ego and personality and then are changed in favor of what the audience is responding to. Charisse is a better dancer than an actress and seems a bit uncomfortable sharing intimate small talk with Astaire, yet she shines in her numbers, especially the final Mickey Spillane film noir spoof at the end, which is as visually clever and elaborate as anything she did opposite Gene Kelly as MGM's top musical actress of the 50s. There is running gag in the movie that Charisse might be too big to dance with Astaire, and with her obvious muscularity she certainly looks like she could bench press him; in actuality Astaire was taller at 5-9 than Charisse's 5-7 and 1/2. She just couldn't stand next to him in heels.

    The Band Wagon is directed by Vincente Minnelli and written by Alan Jay Lerner, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Songs are written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. It stars Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant, Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan. Out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it's a Technicolor production with cinematography by Harry Jackson. Story tells of ageing musical star Tony Hunter (Astaire) whose cinema glory days appear to be well behind him. Upon the request of his friends Lester (Lavant) & Lily Martin (Fabray), he heads to Broadway to appear in a play they have written with him in mind. He hopes this will restart his career, however, the play's director, Jeffrey Cordova (Buchanan), changes the play into an arty interpretation of the Faust legend. Not only that, but he brings in prima ballerina Gabrielle Gerard (Charisse) to star in it, and Tony and Gabrielle don't exactly hit it off. One of the greatest musicals to come out of MGM, The Band Wagon makes up for what it loses in plot ingenuity, with quality songs, stunning choreography, bustling vitality and heart, big heart! Three parts of the film is made up of character building and said characters attempts to put a show on successfully in spite of behind the scenes worries. Then the final third then switches in mood with a different show and primary characters come to their respective destinies. Along the way we are treated to a series of wonderful song and dance routines, with the stand outs being "Be Myself," "A Shine on My Shoes," "That's Entertainment," "Dancing in the Dark," "I Love Louisa," "I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan" and the joyously macabre, "Triplets." These are then crowned magnificently by "Girl Hunt," an elongated parody of noir-type crime movies from the golden era, where it's not just Fred and Cyd who sparkle, but the dance troupe around them also dazzle the eyes with some truly amazing moves. Where the big heart comes in to it is with Astaire's take on the role of Tony. It's very touching at times, full of nostalgia pangs for his former glories. He also has good comic timing, whilst readily able to laugh at himself as the (thin) narrative thread reminds him of his ageing years. The latter of which accounts for the not so great chemistry with the divine Charisse, but the film under Minnelli's active direction easily overcomes this tiny flaw. There's also some salt in the story in the observation of what goes on behind the scenes of a Broadway play, specifically the people pulling the strings. Big production for a big movie, all told, it's big entertainment, yes indeed. 9/10

    The opening titles of Vincente Minnelli's The Band Wagon play over a top hat and cane, which would evoke Fred Astaire even if he weren't the movie's star. Then we see an auction of movie memorabilia. The top hat and cane don't go, even when the auctioneer begs, "50 cents? Anyone?" They belonged to one-time entertainer Tony Hunter, and now we see him, played by Astaire, on a train to NYC. Perhaps he can recover on Broadway. From how he sings "By Myself," he doesn't sound optimistic. The Band Wagon is a comedy, but has a tone of sorrow with its smirks, a grief ever-pervasive among Broadway people, who've seen more letdown than triumph, who understand the show inevitably closes and that the family disperses and returns to the indeterminate state of auditions and out-of-town callbacks. The movie takes a fictitious musical through all the phases of writing, casting, production, choreography, rehearsals, catastrophe on tour and ultimate success on Broadway. It's so blissfully alert to its genre, but it relies on familiarity with the real functioning situations of Broadway pros, just like Singin' in the Rain knew all about the studio-era movie business. The Astaire and Charisse characters are assembled by Jeffrey Cordova, a director-producer-star with arty affectations, who believes the sparkling little musical by the Martons should be revised as a variation on Faust. Cordova is supposedly inspired by Jose Ferrer, but in the self-image and grandiose plans there's a reverberation of Orson Welles. Buchanan, who ribs his own aristocratic poise, enjoys a character who lacks any realistic understanding of budgetary limitations or the patience of an audience. One of the movie's gems is when he admits he's off beam and Astaire is right, and they do a soft-shoe to "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Astaire and Charisse get into a fuming scrap when they first meet, and then, in the scene where the movie's allure first truly emerges, they reconcile mutely in the "Dancing in the Dark" scene in Central Park under a full moon. Here and throughout the film, Charisse is a sexy and qualified equal for Astaire. The extravagant Faustian musical has "got more scenery than Yellowstone National Park." As the disheartened cast assembles in a hotel suite, they perk themselves up with the "I Love Louisa" number, but right when the song ends everyone goes right back into a glum slouch. MGM didn't just reprocess Broadway sensations. They produced new ones from square one, often applying songs they already had. That's effective here because, upon ditching the Faustian musical, the players resolve to stage a variety show. One original song would become a hallmark: Deitz and Schwartz's "That's Entertainment," which commemorates showbiz as merrily though not as madcap as Donald O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" in Singin' in the Rain. One of the older songs that makes a somewhat feebler comeback here is "Louisiana Hayride." Even if in an extravaganza anything, as it were, goes, the hayride feels a little forced. Another number, however, the uncanny "Triplets," sees Astaire, Fabray and Buchanan all deceptively midgets masqueraded like toddlers, sliding down from their high chairs and foxtrotting. Because we see their feet hit the floor and special effects look out of the question, how did they do that?! Part of the movie's fascination comes from a feeling that what we see is not so different from the real course of making it. It's entertainment for sure, but it's also uphill struggle, and Astaire chain-smokes from beginning to end. "I don't think a dancer should smoke," Charisse exhorts early on, but by the end, she's bumming.

    The Band Wagon was one of those films I'd always managed to miss but which turned out to be a lot of fun. There are minor flaws - Cyd Charisse is unflatteringly shot for much of the picture and is nobody's idea of a prima ballerina, Oscar Levant is clearly well lubricated and sadly well past his prime, while there are quite a few technical fluffs, be it the shadow of the camera making yet another appearance or the stagehand strolling casually across the background in the Louisiana Hayride number, and the Girl Hunt ballet finale goes on far too long as per many post-American in Paris MGM musicals - but Comden and Green's script is so sharp and the numbers so good that none of that really matters. Great fun, and glorious Technicolor too.

    The Band Wagon was the last of three of three musicals produced by Arthur Freed that used a selection of numbers by a song-writing team of the previous generation, the first two being An American in Paris (Gershwin) and Singin' in the Rain (Freed and Brown). This time round the music is by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, a lesser-known duo, but their tunes are certainly pretty enough, while their witty and often satirical lyrics make them suited to this nifty take on the long-established backstage musical. There was a bit of a trend round this time in Hollywood for pictures in which the career of the star and their character mirrored one another. Just like Tony Hunter, Fred Astaire really was thought to be an anachronism in some quarters, and had only recently come out of the first of his three retirements. The Band Wagon is to Astaire effectively a light-hearted and less cruel equivalent of what Sunset Boulevard (1950) was to Gloria Swanson, or what A Star is Born (1954) would be to Judy Garland. And while it may swap screen for stage, many of its cheeky digs apply to both media  the misguided vision of a slightly out-of-touch producer, the poaching of stars from different disciplines, the embarrassment of a badly-received premier. There's even spoofing of previous Freed/Minnelli musicals such as The Pirate (the pyrotechnics in the latter movie's daydream sequence are exaggerated her in the Cordova stage show), and of course the Girl Hunt ballet, which lampoons all those convoluted film noirs like The Big Sleep and Out of the Past with spot-on precision, right down to the mean dialogue that is not far from what you really heard in some of the more lowbrow crime thrillers. Girl Hunt is one of the funniest and rhythmically beautiful moments in the picture, and it alone makes the picture worth the watch. Director Vincente Minnelli could really bring a musical like this to life unlike anyone else. His style, a little ostentatious in a drama, is perfect here because it is a kind of choreography. Of course, anyone can have a hard cut or a whip-pan to emphasise a dynamic phrase, but it's the way Minnelli responds to the subtleties of the music that make him stand out. Take the very laid-back "By Myself" number. Those various people walking in the opposite direction to Astaire are timed to the occasional little twiddles in the underscoring. It's a really delicate balance here  those bits of business are not dancey enough to distract from the smoothness of the song or stop Fred being the focus of attention, and yet they add just enough to make it a little more interesting than simply him walking along an empty platform. There are also some great examples here of Minnelli's bold use of colour, in which funnily enough it is often the more muted shades that stand out. For example, when Astaire meets Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant at the station, the three of them are dressed in grey while all the bolder tones are used for background detail. While all Freed musicals have a deliberately unreal look to them even outside of the musical numbers, it's important that this doesn't spill over into making the people and places look ridiculous. It's Minnelli's good taste in these situations that bridges the gap between the idealised musical world and settings we can relate to. And what of the cast, all willingly lampooning if not themselves then at least their trade? Astaire always had a bit of a self-deprecating streak, and he appears to have good fun with the more comical scenes in particular. However unlike Tony Hunter, The Band Wagon failed to regenerate Astaire's career, perhaps because it doesn't quite make such spectacular displays of his dancing as did his older movies, and perhaps because he really was now an old-fashioned player. Whatever the case he went on to have only middling successes for the rest of his career. Astaire also happens to be overshadowed by the supporting performances in this one  Nanette Fabray and her delightfully amusing array of facial expressions, Oscar Levant going a little over the top but still showing great comic timing, and most of all Jack Buchanan. Buchanan absolutely excels in his wild and well-informed caricature of the flamboyant theatre impresario, hilarious even when underplaying, such as when he gets hoisted aloft like a puppet by incompetent stagehands, funnier still when overplaying, such as his crazed acting-out of the Faust story to a group of backers, which Minnelli shrewdly gives us in little snippets through a doorway. Buchanan never really made a big impression in any other screen appearance, but as the madcap Jeff Cordova he deserved at least a nod for Best Supporting Actor. The Band Wagon is not only a fantastic musical; it represents one of the nicest things about Hollywood in the post-war era. For every film noir or gritty drama that picked apart its subject manner with brutal cynicism, there always seemed to be a comedy or a musical doing the same thing in a gentle and even joyful manner. Writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green jumped on the band wagon of Show Business introspection, for an intelligent script that some might dismiss as froth, but only because it lacks the sombre tone of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve. And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

    The songs are simply excellent. Most especially Astaire and Buchanann singing "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Their soft shoe dance routine reinforces the sophistication we should all summon when the girl of our dreams turns out to be the girl of someone else's dreams. "That's Entertainment" "By Myself" two other excellent moments. The final mise-en-scene with Fred Astair and Cyd Charise shows a darkness to Astaire that is often overlooked in his easy comedy. But Rogers and Hammerstein, and before them Hammerstein and Kern--SHOW BOAT--had created and perfected on Broadway the 'integrated musical' where music moved the story line forward. What Fred Astaire, Arthur Freed, Vincent Minnelli had done was a throwback to the review which can best be encapsulated: let's put on a show. Whether that show would be 42 STREET, BABES IN ARMS, THE GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933, or Broadway MELODY--pick a year--they all came down to a vehicle to show off dancing and singing. I don't think this movie wears well over time. It's not as good as SINGING IN THE RAIN which seems smoother and more finished than this film does. Even Comden and Green ON THE TOWN had a smoother unity than this one did. And certainly by 1953, it doesn't even approach anything Rogers and Hammerstein produced on stage, and would produce on film in the future; a standard we all respond to and measure other movie musicals to. Fred Astaire was the best song and dance man in Hollywood; his limited vocal range showed off the lyrics; his comedy was often a self-mockery; his acting was passable for what his roles expected of him. There are no better films then TOP HAT, GAY DIVORCE, EASTER PARADE, and all those movies with Ginger Rogers. Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Dorothy Fields, the Gershwins appreciated the phrasing he brought to a song that made the song important, not the singer. Sadly, this movie reflected a time long gone and simply does not hold up under time. The viewer of 2010 has now seen CABARET, CHICAGO, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. In BANDWAGON, the parts are better than the whole: the viewer loves to see the Fred Astaire and Jack Buchanann soft shoe, but wading through the rest of the story line seems less than rewarding.

    I have seen my fair share of good musicals as well as some disappointing ones. What's for sure for me, The Band Wagon is one of my favourites from the genre. It has a good engaging story and a witty script. It also has brilliant direction from the great Vincente Minelli, and absolutely fabulous production design from the scenery to the costumes. And the choreography is really clever and fabulous, and the same applies for the superb music. As for the performances, Fred Astaire is very likable and stunning here, and Cyd Charisse is simply gorgeous. There are also some very memorable sequences namely the Dancing in the Dark sequence and the Mickey Spillaine parody The Girl Hunt ballet. Overall, this film is fabulous and one of the best of the musical genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    It is a brave film which has a song called That's Entertainment! as its signature number. Because if, as is unfortunately the case with The Band Wagon, the film is not great entertainment...well, the negative review practically writes itself. This is a film which has the good fortune to have two great talents, Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, and the misfortune of completely wasting them. It's a film full of largely forgettable musical numbers and it has a story which never really engages and which in the end goes off the rails completely. To call the film tedious would be harsh but not entirely untrue. The film goes for laughs but fails rather miserably in that regard. It tries to give you a little romance but that angle never heats up. The film has no flow to it, there is a real disjointed feel throughout. No, this is not entertainment. Astaire plays declining movie star Tony Hunter. His friends Lester and Lily Marton have written a stage show which they think can revive his career. They bring it to noted Broadway director/producer/star Jeffrey Cordova who decides to turn what was written as a light comedy into a serious, and seriously bizarre, retelling of Faust. Not surprisingly this proves disastrous. Lester and Lily start bickering. The play, which no longer makes any sense whatsoever, spirals out of control. And all the while tension rises between Tony and his costar, ballerina Gabrielle Gerard. Tony is intimidated by Gabrielle's youth and beauty, not for no reason with Charisse playing the part. And he thinks this classically trained ballerina has no respect for his style of hoofing. Tony and Gabrielle have no chemistry, can't stand one another, can't work together. Eventually they do come together somewhat which provides the film with perhaps its one true highlight, Astaire and Charisse with a wonderful, beautiful dance in a park. Unfortunately after that Tony and Gabrielle's play continues to crumble and so does the film. By the time Astaire and Charisse dance together again much later on the film is past the point of being salvageable. Astaire and Charisse really were hung out to dry here. The supporting cast adds nothing. The loony Cordova character is meant to be over-the-top but Jack Buchanan goes way too far with it. This character is too nuts for the film's good. At least he has some spark to him which is more than can be said for the writing couple, Lester and Lily. Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray play those parts quite lifelessly. And James Mitchell, playing a romantic interest for Gabrielle, is a total wet blanket with all the personality of a doorknob. The musical numbers all fall flat and many make no sense whatsoever. By the end the film is just throwing random songs up on the screen to see what sticks. None of it does. Some of the numbers in the film's homestretch are obviously meant to be funny but they are just terrible, producing groans not laughs. The big final number is a little better even if, as with so much of what preceded it, it makes very little sense. The best musicals have a lot of life in them. The Band Wagon does not. The energy just is not there. The story doesn't work, the songs are forgettable, the performances of the supporting cast leave much to be desired. Astaire and Charisse have a couple of moments. A couple of moments is not enough to make a good film.

    This Fred Astaire film is a bit unique. For once, Astaire plays a man much like himself and this self-deprecating humor makes the film quite enjoyable. For example, the film begins with a couple guys on a train talking about how great Tony Hunter (Astaire) WAS but how he's a bit washed up now---and Hunter is sitting behind a newspaper and he loudly agrees with them! Later, when he's paired with Gabrielle (Cyd Charisse), he complains that he's much too old for her! The story begins with Hunter arriving in New York city to meet a couple old friends who want him in their newest production. Lester and Lily (Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray) think it's a great idea to get a big-name but EXTREMELY self-absorbed actor-director for this production. However, Cordova (Jack Buchanan) wants to completely take over the show and make it his vision--a vision that is quite the opposite of Hunter's style. The show seems destined to fail. Can there be any way to save it from this megalomaniac? The show features many excellent production numbers--all of which are very polished and exciting to watch. The most memorable occurs early in the film when they sing "That's Entertainment" but several other numbers really are crowd-pleasers (like the weird one where they are dressed like babies). As for the story, it's enjoyable and light. My only complaint is Levant. During the 40s, 50s and 60s, he was one of the cleverest raconteurs in Hollywood and on television and was able to deliver wonderful one-liners that could bust your gut. Here, however, he's hardly noticeable. Could it be that they misused him? Or, possibly, that Levant was having emotional problems and just wasn't himself (he was VERY public about his history of Bipolar Disorder). I just know that I was hoping to hear the snappy Oscar Levant. As for the rest, they are all quite good and the film quite enjoyable--one of Astaire's best of the 1950s.

    I've come to the conclusion that Vincente Minelli and Oscar Levant are cinematic poison. Imagine how good An American in Paris and Brigadoon could have been if Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly had been the directing team. Imagine how much better all movies, TV shows and piano recitals could have been without Oscar Levant, whose main claim to fame was that he was a friend of George Gershwin. Astaire and Charisse are phenomenal, but even they can't redeem this mishmash of forgettable songs, tortuous plotting and second-rate supporting actors/singers/dancers. They deserved better.

One original song would become a hallmark: Deitz and Schwartz's "That's Entertainment," which commemorates showbiz as merrily though not as madcap as Donald O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" in Singin' in the Rain. One of the older songs that makes a somewhat feebler comeback here is "Louisiana Hayride." Even if in an extravaganza anything, as it were, goes, the hayride feels a little forced. Another number, however, the uncanny "Triplets," sees Astaire, Fabray and Buchanan all deceptively midgets masqueraded like toddlers, sliding down from their high chairs and foxtrotting. Because we see their feet hit the floor and special effects look out of the question, how did they do that?! Part of the movie's fascination comes from a feeling that what we see is not so different from the real course of making it. It's entertainment for sure, but it's also uphill struggle, and Astaire chain-smokes from beginning to end. "I don't think a dancer should smoke," Charisse exhorts early on, but by the end, she's bumming.

    The Band Wagon was one of those films I'd always managed to miss but which turned out to be a lot of fun. There are minor flaws - Cyd Charisse is unflatteringly shot for much of the picture and is nobody's idea of a prima ballerina, Oscar Levant is clearly well lubricated and sadly well past his prime, while there are quite a few technical fluffs, be it the shadow of the camera making yet another appearance or the stagehand strolling casually across the background in the Louisiana Hayride number, and the Girl Hunt ballet finale goes on far too long as per many post-American in Paris MGM musicals - but Comden and Green's script is so sharp and the numbers so good that none of that really matters. Great fun, and glorious Technicolor too.

    The Band Wagon was the last of three of three musicals produced by Arthur Freed that used a selection of numbers by a song-writing team of the previous generation, the first two being An American in Paris (Gershwin) and Singin' in the Rain (Freed and Brown). This time round the music is by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz, a lesser-known duo, but their tunes are certainly pretty enough, while their witty and often satirical lyrics make them suited to this nifty take on the long-established backstage musical. There was a bit of a trend round this time in Hollywood for pictures in which the career of the star and their character mirrored one another. Just like Tony Hunter, Fred Astaire really was thought to be an anachronism in some quarters, and had only recently come out of the first of his three retirements. The Band Wagon is to Astaire effectively a light-hearted and less cruel equivalent of what Sunset Boulevard (1950) was to Gloria Swanson, or what A Star is Born (1954) would be to Judy Garland. And while it may swap screen for stage, many of its cheeky digs apply to both media  the misguided vision of a slightly out-of-touch producer, the poaching of stars from different disciplines, the embarrassment of a badly-received premier. There's even spoofing of previous Freed/Minnelli musicals such as The Pirate (the pyrotechnics in the latter movie's daydream sequence are exaggerated her in the Cordova stage show), and of course the Girl Hunt ballet, which lampoons all those convoluted film noirs like The Big Sleep and Out of the Past with spot-on precision, right down to the mean dialogue that is not far from what you really heard in some of the more lowbrow crime thrillers. Girl Hunt is one of the funniest and rhythmically beautiful moments in the picture, and it alone makes the picture worth the watch. Director Vincente Minnelli could really bring a musical like this to life unlike anyone else. His style, a little ostentatious in a drama, is perfect here because it is a kind of choreography. Of course, anyone can have a hard cut or a whip-pan to emphasise a dynamic phrase, but it's the way Minnelli responds to the subtleties of the music that make him stand out. Take the very laid-back "By Myself" number. Those various people walking in the opposite direction to Astaire are timed to the occasional little twiddles in the underscoring. It's a really delicate balance here  those bits of business are not dancey enough to distract from the smoothness of the song or stop Fred being the focus of attention, and yet they add just enough to make it a little more interesting than simply him walking along an empty platform. There are also some great examples here of Minnelli's bold use of colour, in which funnily enough it is often the more muted shades that stand out. For example, when Astaire meets Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant at the station, the three of them are dressed in grey while all the bolder tones are used for background detail. While all Freed musicals have a deliberately unreal look to them even outside of the musical numbers, it's important that this doesn't spill over into making the people and places look ridiculous. It's Minnelli's good taste in these situations that bridges the gap between the idealised musical world and settings we can relate to. And what of the cast, all willingly lampooning if not themselves then at least their trade? Astaire always had a bit of a self-deprecating streak, and he appears to have good fun with the more comical scenes in particular. However unlike Tony Hunter, The Band Wagon failed to regenerate Astaire's career, perhaps because it doesn't quite make such spectacular displays of his dancing as did his older movies, and perhaps because he really was now an old-fashioned player. Whatever the case he went on to have only middling successes for the rest of his career. Astaire also happens to be overshadowed by the supporting performances in this one  Nanette Fabray and her delightfully amusing array of facial expressions, Oscar Levant going a little over the top but still showing great comic timing, and most of all Jack Buchanan. Buchanan absolutely excels in his wild and well-informed caricature of the flamboyant theatre impresario, hilarious even when underplaying, such as when he gets hoisted aloft like a puppet by incompetent stagehands, funnier still when overplaying, such as his crazed acting-out of the Faust story to a group of backers, which Minnelli shrewdly gives us in little snippets through a doorway. Buchanan never really made a big impression in any other screen appearance, but as the madcap Jeff Cordova he deserved at least a nod for Best Supporting Actor. The Band Wagon is not only a fantastic musical; it represents one of the nicest things about Hollywood in the post-war era. For every film noir or gritty drama that picked apart its subject manner with brutal cynicism, there always seemed to be a comedy or a musical doing the same thing in a gentle and even joyful manner. Writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green jumped on the band wagon of Show Business introspection, for an intelligent script that some might dismiss as froth, but only because it lacks the sombre tone of Sunset Boulevard and All About Eve. And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

    The songs are simply excellent. Most especially Astaire and Buchanann singing "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Their soft shoe dance routine reinforces the sophistication we should all summon when the girl of our dreams turns out to be the girl of someone else's dreams. "That's Entertainment" "By Myself" two other excellent moments. The final mise-en-scene with Fred Astair and Cyd Charise shows a darkness to Astaire that is often overlooked in his easy comedy. But Rogers and Hammerstein, and before them Hammerstein and Kern--SHOW BOAT--had created and perfected on Broadway the 'integrated musical' where music moved the story line forward. What Fred Astaire, Arthur Freed, Vincent Minnelli had done was a throwback to the review which can best be encapsulated: let's put on a show. Whether that show would be 42 STREET, BABES IN ARMS, THE GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933, or Broadway MELODY--pick a year--they all came down to a vehicle to show off dancing and singing. I don't think this movie wears well over time. It's not as good as SINGING IN THE RAIN which seems smoother and more finished than this film does. Even Comden and Green ON THE TOWN had a smoother unity than this one did. And certainly by 1953, it doesn't even approach anything Rogers and Hammerstein produced on stage, and would produce on film in the future; a standard we all respond to and measure other movie musicals to. Fred Astaire was the best song and dance man in Hollywood; his limited vocal range showed off the lyrics; his comedy was often a self-mockery; his acting was passable for what his roles expected of him. There are no better films then TOP HAT, GAY DIVORCE, EASTER PARADE, and all those movies with Ginger Rogers. Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Dorothy Fields, the Gershwins appreciated the phrasing he brought to a song that made the song important, not the singer. Sadly, this movie reflected a time long gone and simply does not hold up under time. The viewer of 2010 has now seen CABARET, CHICAGO, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. In BANDWAGON, the parts are better than the whole: the viewer loves to see the Fred Astaire and Jack Buchanann soft shoe, but wading through the rest of the story line seems less than rewarding.

    I have seen my fair share of good musicals as well as some disappointing ones. What's for sure for me, The Band Wagon is one of my favourites from the genre. It has a good engaging story and a witty script. It also has brilliant direction from the great Vincente Minelli, and absolutely fabulous production design from the scenery to the costumes. And the choreography is really clever and fabulous, and the same applies for the superb music. As for the performances, Fred Astaire is very likable and stunning here, and Cyd Charisse is simply gorgeous. There are also some very memorable sequences namely the Dancing in the Dark sequence and the Mickey Spillaine parody The Girl Hunt ballet. Overall, this film is fabulous and one of the best of the musical genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    It is a brave film which has a song called That's Entertainment! as its signature number. Because if, as is unfortunately the case with The Band Wagon, the film is not great entertainment...well, the negative review practically writes itself. This is a film which has the good fortune to have two great talents, Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, and the misfortune of completely wasting them. It's a film full of largely forgettable musical numbers and it has a story which never really engages and which in the end goes off the rails completely. To call the film tedious would be harsh but not entirely untrue. The film goes for laughs but fails rather miserably in that regard. It tries to give you a little romance but that angle never heats up. The film has no flow to it, there is a real disjointed feel throughout. No, this is not entertainment. Astaire plays declining movie star Tony Hunter. His friends Lester and Lily Marton have written a stage show which they think can revive his career. They bring it to noted Broadway director/producer/star Jeffrey Cordova who decides to turn what was written as a light comedy into a serious, and seriously bizarre, retelling of Faust. Not surprisingly this proves disastrous. Lester and Lily start bickering. The play, which no longer makes any sense whatsoever, spirals out of control. And all the while tension rises between Tony and his costar, ballerina Gabrielle Gerard. Tony is intimidated by Gabrielle's youth and beauty, not for no reason with Charisse playing the part. And he thinks this classically trained ballerina has no respect for his style of hoofing. Tony and Gabrielle have no chemistry, can't stand one another, can't work together. Eventually they do come together somewhat which provides the film with perhaps its one true highlight, Astaire and Charisse with a wonderful, beautiful dance in a park. Unfortunately after that Tony and Gabrielle's play continues to crumble and so does the film. By the time Astaire and Charisse dance together again much later on the film is past the point of being salvageable. Astaire and Charisse really were hung out to dry here. The supporting cast adds nothing. The loony Cordova character is meant to be over-the-top but Jack Buchanan goes way too far with it. This character is too nuts for the film's good. At least he has some spark to him which is more than can be said for the writing couple, Lester and Lily. Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray play those parts quite lifelessly. And James Mitchell, playing a romantic interest for Gabrielle, is a total wet blanket with all the personality of a doorknob. The musical numbers all fall flat and many make no sense whatsoever. By the end the film is just throwing random songs up on the screen to see what sticks. None of it does. Some of the numbers in the film's homestretch are obviously meant to be funny but they are just terrible, producing groans not laughs. The big final number is a little better even if, as with so much of what preceded it, it makes very little sense. The best musicals have a lot of life in them. The Band Wagon does not. The energy just is not there. The story doesn't work, the songs are forgettable, the performances of the supporting cast leave much to be desired. Astaire and Charisse have a couple of moments. A couple of moments is not enough to make a good film.

    This Fred Astaire film is a bit unique. For once, Astaire plays a man much like himself and this self-deprecating humor makes the film quite enjoyable. For example, the film begins with a couple guys on a train talking about how great Tony Hunter (Astaire) WAS but how he's a bit washed up now---and Hunter is sitting behind a newspaper and he loudly agrees with them! Later, when he's paired with Gabrielle (Cyd Charisse), he complains that he's much too old for her! The story begins with Hunter arriving in New York city to meet a couple old friends who want him in their newest production. Lester and Lily (Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray) think it's a great idea to get a big-name but EXTREMELY self-absorbed actor-director for this production. However, Cordova (Jack Buchanan) wants to completely take over the show and make it his vision--a vision that is quite the opposite of Hunter's style. The show seems destined to fail. Can there be any way to save it from this megalomaniac? The show features many excellent production numbers--all of which are very polished and exciting to watch. The most memorable occurs early in the film when they sing "That's Entertainment" but several other numbers really are crowd-pleasers (like the weird one where they are dressed like babies). As for the story, it's enjoyable and light. My only complaint is Levant. During the 40s, 50s and 60s, he was one of the cleverest raconteurs in Hollywood and on television and was able to deliver wonderful one-liners that could bust your gut. Here, however, he's hardly noticeable. Could it be that they misused him? Or, possibly, that Levant was having emotional problems and just wasn't himself (he was VERY public about his history of Bipolar Disorder). I just know that I was hoping to hear the snappy Oscar Levant. As for the rest, they are all quite good and the film quite enjoyable--one of Astaire's best of the 1950s.

    I've come to the conclusion that Vincente Minelli and Oscar Levant are cinematic poison. Imagine how good An American in Paris and Brigadoon could have been if Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly had been the directing team. Imagine how much better all movies, TV shows and piano recitals could have been without Oscar Levant, whose main claim to fame was that he was a friend of George Gershwin. Astaire and Charisse are phenomenal, but even they can't redeem this mishmash of forgettable songs, tortuous plotting and second-rate supporting actors/singers/dancers. They deserved better.

    The plot-line is a familiar puttin'-on-a-show backstage musical story that went back twenty years to the beginning of talkies, but clever inside jokes and showbiz references are woven into it for the enjoyment of those in the know: Jack Buchanan's Broadway 'genius' is a sly take on Jose Ferrer, who at one time had written, directed or was starring in four shows running on Broadway simultaneously; Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray's professionally functional / personally dysfunctional relationship is a riff on famous MGM songwriting team Betty Comden and Adolphe Greene; and Fred Astaire is basically playing himself as a movie star of an earlier vintage making a comeback on Broadway amidst much younger talent. The actual story line is almost a throwaway - Buchanan's monumentally over-produced show bombs out of town and has to be revised before making its Broadway debut, but at the same time it gives the viewer a chance to ruminate on the musical as a form and glimpse the creative process as decisions get made initially for reasons of ego and personality and then are changed in favor of what the audience is responding to. Charisse is a better dancer than an actress and seems a bit uncomfortable sharing intimate small talk with Astaire, yet she shines in her numbers, especially the final Mickey Spillane film noir spoof at the end, which is as visually clever and elaborate as anything she did opposite Gene Kelly as MGM's top musical actress of the 50s. There is running gag in the movie that Charisse might be too big to dance with Astaire, and with her obvious muscularity she certainly looks like she could bench press him; in actuality Astaire was taller at 5-9 than Charisse's 5-7 and 1/2. She just couldn't stand next to him in heels.

    The Band Wagon is directed by Vincente Minnelli and written by Alan Jay Lerner, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Songs are written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. It stars Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant, Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan. Out of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it's a Technicolor production with cinematography by Harry Jackson. Story tells of ageing musical star Tony Hunter (Astaire) whose cinema glory days appear to be well behind him. Upon the request of his friends Lester (Lavant) & Lily Martin (Fabray), he heads to Broadway to appear in a play they have written with him in mind. He hopes this will restart his career, however, the play's director, Jeffrey Cordova (Buchanan), changes the play into an arty interpretation of the Faust legend. Not only that, but he brings in prima ballerina Gabrielle Gerard (Charisse) to star in it, and Tony and Gabrielle don't exactly hit it off. One of the greatest musicals to come out of MGM, The Band Wagon makes up for what it loses in plot ingenuity, with quality songs, stunning choreography, bustling vitality and heart, big heart! Three parts of the film is made up of character building and said characters attempts to put a show on successfully in spite of behind the scenes worries. Then the final third then switches in mood with a different show and primary characters come to their respective destinies. Along the way we are treated to a series of wonderful song and dance routines, with the stand outs being "Be Myself," "A Shine on My Shoes," "That's Entertainment," "Dancing in the Dark," "I Love Louisa," "I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan" and the joyously macabre, "Triplets." These are then crowned magnificently by "Girl Hunt," an elongated parody of noir-type crime movies from the golden era, where it's not just Fred and Cyd who sparkle, but the dance troupe around them also dazzle the eyes with some truly amazing moves. Where the big heart comes in to it is with Astaire's take on the role of Tony. It's very touching at times, full of nostalgia pangs for his former glories. He also has good comic timing, whilst readily able to laugh at himself as the (thin) narrative thread reminds him of his ageing years. The latter of which accounts for the not so great chemistry with the divine Charisse, but the film under Minnelli's active direction easily overcomes this tiny flaw. There's also some salt in the story in the observation of what goes on behind the scenes of a Broadway play, specifically the people pulling the strings. Big production for a big movie, all told, it's big entertainment, yes indeed. 9/10

    The opening titles of Vincente Minnelli's The Band Wagon play over a top hat and cane, which would evoke Fred Astaire even if he weren't the movie's star. Then we see an auction of movie memorabilia. The top hat and cane don't go, even when the auctioneer begs, "50 cents? Anyone?" They belonged to one-time entertainer Tony Hunter, and now we see him, played by Astaire, on a train to NYC. Perhaps he can recover on Broadway. From how he sings "By Myself," he doesn't sound optimistic. The Band Wagon is a comedy, but has a tone of sorrow with its smirks, a grief ever-pervasive among Broadway people, who've seen more letdown than triumph, who understand the show inevitably closes and that the family disperses and returns to the indeterminate state of auditions and out-of-town callbacks. The movie takes a fictitious musical through all the phases of writing, casting, production, choreography, rehearsals, catastrophe on tour and ultimate success on Broadway. It's so blissfully alert to its genre, but it relies on familiarity with the real functioning situations of Broadway pros, just like Singin' in the Rain knew all about the studio-era movie business. The Astaire and Charisse characters are assembled by Jeffrey Cordova, a director-producer-star with arty affectations, who believes the sparkling little musical by the Martons should be revised as a variation on Faust. Cordova is supposedly inspired by Jose Ferrer, but in the self-image and grandiose plans there's a reverberation of Orson Welles. Buchanan, who ribs his own aristocratic poise, enjoys a character who lacks any realistic understanding of budgetary limitations or the patience of an audience. One of the movie's gems is when he admits he's off beam and Astaire is right, and they do a soft-shoe to "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Astaire and Charisse get into a fuming scrap when they first meet, and then, in the scene where the movie's allure first truly emerges, they reconcile mutely in the "Dancing in the Dark" scene in Central Park under a full moon. Here and throughout the film, Charisse is a sexy and qualified equal for Astaire. The extravagant Faustian musical has "got more scenery than Yellowstone National Park." As the disheartened cast assembles in a hotel suite, they perk themselves up with the "I Love Louisa" number, but right when the song ends everyone goes right back into a glum slouch. MGM didn't just reprocess Broadway sensations. They produced new ones from square one, often applying songs they already had. That's effective here because, upon ditching the Faustian musical, the players resolve to stage a variety show. One original song would become a hallmark: Deitz and Schwartz's "That's Entertainment," which commemorates showbiz as merrily though not as madcap as Donald O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" in Singin' in the Rain. One of the older songs that makes a somewhat feebler comeback here is "Louisiana Hayride." Even if in an extravaganza anything, as it were, goes, the hayride feels a little forced. Another number, however, the uncanny "Triplets," sees Astaire, Fabray and Buchanan all deceptively midgets masqueraded like toddlers, sliding down from their high chairs and foxtrotting. Because we see their feet hit the floor and special effects look out of the question, how did they do that?! Part of the movie's fascination comes from a feeling that what we see is not so different from the real course of making it. It's entertainment for sure, but it's also uphill struggle, and Astaire chain-smokes from beginning to end. "I don't think a dancer should smoke," Charisse exhorts early on, but by the end, she's bumming.

And it was the brilliance of those Comden, Green, Freed and Minnelli that could turn a gloomy subgenre into something as vibrant and appealing as this. That's Entertainment indeed.

    The songs are simply excellent. Most especially Astaire and Buchanann singing "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan." Their soft shoe dance routine reinforces the sophistication we should all summon when the girl of our dreams turns out to be the girl of someone else's dreams. "That's Entertainment" "By Myself" two other excellent moments. The final mise-en-scene with Fred Astair and Cyd Charise shows a darkness to Astaire that is often overlooked in his easy comedy. But Rogers and Hammerstein, and before them Hammerstein and Kern--SHOW BOAT--had created and perfected on Broadway the 'integrated musical' where music moved the story line forward. What Fred Astaire, Arthur Freed, Vincent Minnelli had done was a throwback to the review which can best be encapsulated: let's put on a show. Whether that show would be 42 STREET, BABES IN ARMS, THE GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933, or Broadway MELODY--pick a year--they all came down to a vehicle to show off dancing and singing. I don't think this movie wears well over time. It's not as good as SINGING IN THE RAIN which seems smoother and more finished than this film does. Even Comden and Green ON THE TOWN had a smoother unity than this one did. And certainly by 1953, it doesn't even approach anything Rogers and Hammerstein produced on stage, and would produce on film in the future; a standard we all respond to and measure other movie musicals to. Fred Astaire was the best song and dance man in Hollywood; his limited vocal range showed off the lyrics; his comedy was often a self-mockery; his acting was passable for what his roles expected of him. There are no better films then TOP HAT, GAY DIVORCE, EASTER PARADE, and all those movies with Ginger Rogers. Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Dorothy Fields, the Gershwins appreciated the phrasing he brought to a song that made the song important, not the singer. Sadly, this movie reflected a time long gone and simply does not hold up under time. The viewer of 2010 has now seen CABARET, CHICAGO, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. In BANDWAGON, the parts are better than the whole: the viewer loves to see the Fred Astaire and Jack Buchanann soft shoe, but wading through the rest of the story line seems less than rewarding.

    I have seen my fair share of good musicals as well as some disappointing ones. What's for sure for me, The Band Wagon is one of my favourites from the genre. It has a good engaging story and a witty script. It also has brilliant direction from the great Vincente Minelli, and absolutely fabulous production design from the scenery to the costumes. And the choreography is really clever and fabulous, and the same applies for the superb music. As for the performances, Fred Astaire is very likable and stunning here, and Cyd Charisse is simply gorgeous. There are also some very memorable sequences namely the Dancing in the Dark sequence and the Mickey Spillaine parody The Girl Hunt ballet. Overall, this film is fabulous and one of the best of the musical genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox
